            "Abstract": "XML is extensively used in web services for integration and data exchange. Its popularity and wide adoption make it an attractive target for attackers and a number of XML-based attack types have been reported recently. This raises the need for cost-effective, automated testing of web services to detect XML-related vulnerabilities, which is the focus of this paper. We discuss a taxonomy of the types of XML injec- tion attacks and use it to derive four different ways to mutate XML messages, turning them into attacks (tests) automatically. Further, we consider domain constraints and attack grammars, and use a constraint solver to generate XML messages that are both malicious and valid, thus making it more difficult for any protection mechanism to recognise them. As a result, such messages have a better chance to detect vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on an industrial case study has shown that a large proportion (78.86%) of the attacks generated using our approach could circumvent the first layer of security protection, an XML gateway (firewall), a result that is much better than what a state-of-the-art tool based on fuzz testing could achieve.",

            "Abstract": "Automated testing is an important part of validating the behavior of software with complex graphical user interfaces, such as web, mobile, and desktop applications. Despite recent advances in UI-level test generation, existing approaches often fail to create complex sequences of events that represent realistic user interactions. As a result, these approaches cannot reach particular parts of the application under test, which then remain untested. This paper presents a UI-level test generation approach that exploits execution traces of human users to automatically create complex sequences of events that go beyond the recorded traces. The key idea is to infer so-called macro events, i.e., sequences of low-level UI events that correspond to a single logical step of interaction, such as choosing an item of a drop-down menu or filling and submitting a form. The approach builds upon and adapts well-known data mining techniques, in particular frequent subsequence mining and inference of finite state machines. We implement the approach for client-side web applications and apply it to four real-world applications. Our results show that macro-based test generation reaches more pages, exercises more usage scenarios, and covers more code within a fixed testing budget than a purely random test generator.",

However, the maintenance cost of the automatically generated tests presents a significant barrier to adoption of this technology. To address this challenge, we propose a novel technique for automated and fine-grained incremental generation of unit tests through minimal augmentation of an existing test suite. The technique uses iterative, incremental refinement of test-drivers and symbolic execution, guided by a diagnostics engine. The diagnostics engine works off a novel precise and efficient byte-level dynamic dependence analysis built using Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs). We present a tool FSX implementing this technique and evaluate it under two practical use-cases of incremental unit test generation, on five revisions of the open-source software iPerf, as well as on 3 large subjects, comprising more than 60 thousand lines of code, from in-house commercial network products. The evaluation shows that FSX can generate high-quality unit tests on large industrial software while minimizing the maintenance cost of the overall test-suite.",

            "Abstract": "Test case generation tools that optimize code coverage have been extensively investigated. Recently, researchers have suggested to add other non-coverage criteria, such as memory consumption or readability, to increase the practical usefulness of generated tests. In this paper, we observe that test code quality metrics, and test cohesion and coupling in particular, are valuable candidates as additional criteria. Indeed, tests with low cohesion and/or high coupling have been shown to have a negative impact on future maintenance activities. In an exploratory investigation we show that most generated tests are indeed affected by poor test code quality. For this reason, we incorporate cohesion and coupling metrics into the main loop of search-based algorithm for test case generation. Through an empirical study we show that our approach is not only able to generate tests that are more cohesive and less coupled, but can (i) increase branch coverage up to 10% when enough time is given to the search and (ii) result in statistically shorter tests.",

            "Abstract": "Android developers heavily use reflection in their apps for legitimate reasons, but also significantly for hiding malicious actions. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art static analysis tools for Android are challenged by the presence of reflective calls which they usually ignore. Thus, the results of their security analysis, e.g., for private data leaks, are inconsistent given the measures taken by malware writers to elude static detection. We propose the DroidRA instrumentation-based approach to address this issue in a non-invasive way. With DroidRA, we reduce the resolution of reflective calls to a composite constant propagation problem. We leverage the COAL solver to infer the values of reflection targets and app, and we eventually instrument this app to include the corresponding traditional Java call for each reflective call. Our approach allows to boost an app so that it can be immediately analyzable, including by such static analyzers that were not reflection-aware. We evaluate DroidRA on benchmark apps as well as on real-world apps, and demonstrate that it can allow state-of-the-art tools to provide more sound and complete analysis results.",

My current research interests are related to Formal Methods, Security, Software Engineering and Multi-Agent systems. For model checking algorithms and tools, we are developing a model checker development framework Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) development, which is a self-contained framework to support composing, simulating and reasoning of various systems (e.g., concurrent and real-time systems, probabilistic systems, web-service, security protocols, sensor networks, software architecture description language and so on). For cybersecurity, we are working at malware modeling, detection, classification and generation with the focus on Javascript malware (refer to AsiaCCS 2015 and ISSTA 2015 papers), desktop malware and Android malware (AsiaCCS 2016, IJCNN 2016, ISSTA 2016). We are developing tools for vulnerability modeling and detection using machine learning and (both static and dynamic) program analysis on binary code. In our recent Securify research project, we are performing formal verification on security system from hardware, hypervisor (ISSRE 2015 and TACAS 2016 papers), library to programs using different verification approaches. For software engineering, we are working on the topics related to program specification generation (ASE 2013 and FSE 2015 papers), performance analysis (ICSE 2016 paper), reliability analysis (ISSTA 2014 paper), code clone analysis (ICSE 2014 paper), automatic loop analysis (ISSTA 2015 paper) using techniques like model checking, symbolic execution, machine learning and testing. We are building tools related to these aspects. For multi-agent systems, we are working on the topics related to formal modeling of various multi-agent systems, particularly trust management systems and their analysis in correctness, security and robustness (AAAI, IJCAI and AAMAS papers).",

He directs the Paradyn Tools project, which is investigating program scalability and binary program analysis and instrumentation technologies for use in HPC, systems design, and cyber-security. Miller is Chief Scientist of the DHS-funded Software Assurance Marketplace (SWAMP) research center, a joint effort between the Morgridge Institute of Research, University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences Department, Indiana University, and the University of Illinois. He also directs the vulnerability assessment and training program for the NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, the Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure. He also co-directs the MIST software vulnerability assessment project in collaboration with his colleagues at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. His research interests include tools for high-performance computing systems, binary code analysis and instrumentation, computer security, and scalable distributed systems. In 1988, Miller founded the field of Fuzz random software testing, which is the foundation of many security and software engineering disciplines. In 1992, Miller (working with his then-student, Prof. Jeffrey Hollingsworth), founded the field of dynamic binary code instrumentation and coined the term &quot;dynamic instrumentation&quot;. Miller co-chaired Shonan Meetings on &quot;Grid and Cloud Security: A Confluence&quot; in 2012 and 2014, co-chaired the Supercomputing 2008 Tutorials Technical Program and Supercomputing 2003 Papers Technical Program. He was Program co-Chair of the 1998 ACM/SIGMETRICS Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Tools, and General Chair of the 1996 ACM/SIGMETRICS Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Tools. He was co-chair of the 2009 Dagstuhl Seminar on Program Development for Extreme-Scale Computing, co-chaired the 2007 Dagstuhl Seminar on Code Instrumentation &#38; Modeling for Parallel Performance Analysis and the 2005 Dagstuhl Seminar on Automated Performance Analysis (as well as several previous Dagstuhl seminars). He also twice chaired the ACM/ONR Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Debugging. Miller has been on the editorial board of IEEE Transactions on Parallel Distributed Systems, the International Journal of Parallel Processing, Concurrency and Computation Practice &#38; Experience, and the Journal of Computing Systems. Miller has chaired numerous other workshops and has been on a variety of conference program committees. He is also a member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing.

I currently participate in BinSec project to design and implement a guided dynamic symbolic execution engine, and for a formal approach to deobfuscate virtualization-obfuscated binaries. Before joining PACSS, I have completed my PhD at Lorraine University, in CARTE group at Loria laboratory. My thesis is about a formal model for obfuscating transformations on behaviors of programs, and about a semantics-based method to synthesizing hidden automata of input message parsers of malwares. My research focuses on automated methods for computer security, particularly for binary code analysis and malware detection. I am interested in formal methods on program analysis/verification, and their applications in extracting high-level similarities between obfuscated programs.",

He is in the editorial board of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, of Empirical Software Engineering, Springer, and of the Journal of Software: Evolution and Process, Wiley. Paolo Tonella teaches Security Testing at the University of Trento, MSc degree in Computer Science. Paolo Tonella has given foundational contributions to Software Engineering, in the area of code analysis and testing. His ICSE Most Influential Paper (MIP) award winning paper, Analysis and Testing of Web Applications, initiated a new stream of research devoted to the development of testing techniques for web applications. His comprehensive book Reverse Engineering of Object-Oriented Code laid the foundations for the reverse engineering of object-oriented systems. His ISSTA 2004 paper Evolutionary Testing of Classes is recognized as a milestone for the automated generation of object oriented test cases. One of the most widely used Java test case generators, EvoSuite, can be traced back to this seminal ISSTA paper and to the associated tool, eToc. In June 2014, Paolo Tonella has given a distinguished lecture on Model Based Testing at the University of Luxembourg.",
