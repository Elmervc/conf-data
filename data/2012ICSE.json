  "Title": "A Systematic Study of Automated Program Repair: Fixing 55 out of 105 Bugs for $8 Each",
  "Type": "Full paper (10+1 pages)",

  "Authors": ["Claire Le Goues", "Michael Dewey-Vogt", "Stephanie Forrest", "Westley Weimer"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Virginia, USA", "University of New Mexico, USA"],
  "Abstract": "There are more bugs in real-world programs than human programmers can realistically address. This paper evaluates two research questions. ``What fraction of bugs can be repaired automatically?'' and ``How much does it cost to repair a bug automatically?'' In previous work, we presented GenProg, which uses genetic programming to repair defects in off-the-shelf C programs. To answer these questions, we. (1) propose novel algorithmic improvements to GenProg that allow it to scale to large programs and find repairs 68% more often, (2) exploit GenProg's inherent parallelism using cloud computing resources to provide grounded, human-competitive cost measurements, and (3) generate a large, indicative benchmark set to use for systematic evaluations. We evaluate GenProg on 105 defects from 8 open-source programs totaling 5.1 million lines of code and involving 10,193 test cases. GenProg automatically repairs 55 of those 105 defects. To our knowledge, this evaluation is the largest available of its kind, and is often two orders of magnitude larger than previous work in terms of code or test suite size or defect count. Public cloud computing prices allow our 105 runs to be reproduced for $403; a successful repair completes in 96 minutes and costs $7.32, on average."

  "Title": "Where Should the Bugs Be Fixed? - More Accurate Information Retrieval-Based Bug Localization Based on Bug Reports",
  "Type": "Full paper (10+1 pages)",
  "Key": "icse12main-tt-301-zhou",
  "Authors": ["Jian Zhou", "Hongyu Zhang", "David Lo"],
  "Affiliations": ["Tsinghua University, China", "Singapore Management University, Singapore"],
  "Abstract": "For a large and evolving software system, the project team could receive a large number of bug reports. Locating the source code files that need to be changed in order to fix the bugs is a challenging task. Once a bug report is received, it is desirable to automatically point out to the files that developers should change in order to fix the bug. In this paper, we propose BugLocator, an information retrieval based method for locating the relevant files for fixing a bug. BugLocator ranks all files based on the textual similarity between the initial bug report and the source code using a revised Vector Space Model (rVSM), taking into consideration information about similar bugs that have been fixed before. We perform large-scale experiments on four open source projects to localize more than 3,000 bugs. The results show that BugLocator can effectively locate the files where the bugs should be fixed. For example, relevant buggy files for 62.60% Eclipse 3.1 bugs are ranked in the top ten among 12,863 files. Our experiments also show that BugLocator outperforms existing state-of-the-art bug localization methods."

  "Authors": ["Jifeng Xuan", "He Jiang", "Zhilei Ren", "Weiqin Zou"],
  "Affiliations": ["Dalian University of Technology, China"],
  "Abstract": "Developers build all the software artifacts in development. Existing work has studied the social behavior in software repositories. In one of the most important software repositories, a bug repository, developers create and update bug reports to support software development and maintenance. However, no prior work has considered the priorities of developers in bug repositories. In this paper, we address the problem of the developer prioritization, which aims to rank the contributions of developers. We mainly explore two aspects, namely modeling the developer prioritization in a bug repository and assisting predictive tasks with our model. First, we model how to assign the priorities of developers based on a social network technique. Three problems are investigated, including the developer rankings in products, the evolution over time, and the tolerance of noisy comments. Second, we consider leveraging the developer prioritization to improve three predicted tasks in bug repositories, i.e., bug triage, severity identification, and reopened bug prediction. We empirically investigate the performance of our model and its applications in bug repositories of Eclipse and Mozilla. The results indicate that the developer prioritization can provide the knowledge of developer priorities to assist software tasks, especially the task of bug triage."

  "Title": "WhoseFault: Automatic Developer-to-Fault Assignment through Fault Localization",
  "Type": "Full paper (10+1 pages)",
  "Key": "icse12main-tt-483-servant",
  "Authors": ["Francisco Servant", "James A. Jones"],
  "Affiliations": ["UC Irvine, USA"],
  "Abstract": "This paper describes a new technique, which automatically selects the most appropriate developers for fixing the fault represented by a failing test case, and provides a diagnosis of where to look for the fault. This technique works by incorporating three key components. (1) fault localization to inform locations whose execution correlate with failure, (2) history mining to inform which developers edited each line of code and when, and (3) expertise assignment to map locations to developers. To our knowledge, the technique is the first to assign developers to execution failures, without the need for textual bug reports. We implement this technique in our tool, WhoseFault, and describe an experiment where we utilize a large, open-source project to determine the frequency in which our tool suggests an assignment to the actual developer who fixed the fault. Our results show that 81% of the time, WhoseFault produced the same developer that actually fixed the fault within the top three suggestions. We also show that our technique improved by a difference between 4% and 40% the results of a baseline technique. Finally, we explore the influence of each of the three components of our technique over its results, and compare our expertise algorithm against an existing expertise assessment technique and find that our algorithm provides greater accuracy, by up to 37%."

  "Key": "icse12main-tt-215-dagenais",
  "Authors": ["Barthélémy Dagenais", "Martin P. Robillard"],
  "Affiliations": ["McGill University, Canada"],
  "Abstract": "Large frameworks and libraries require extensive developer learning resources, such as documentation and mailing lists, to be useful. Maintaining these learning resources is challenging partly because they are not explicitly linked to the frameworks' API, and changes in the API are not reflected in the learning resources. Automatically recovering traceability links between an API and learning resources is notoriously difficult due to the inherent ambiguity of unstructured natural language. Code elements mentioned in documents are rarely fully qualified, so readers need to understand the context in which a code element is mentioned. We propose a technique that identifies code-like terms in documents and links these terms to specific code elements in an API, such as methods. In an evaluation study with four open source systems, we found that our technique had an average recall and precision of 96%."

  "Authors": ["Yingfei Xiong", "Arnaud Hubaux", "Steven She", "Krzysztof Czarnecki"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Waterloo, Canada", "University of Namur, Belgium"],
  "Abstract": "To prevent ill-formed configurations, highly configurable software often allows defining constraints over the available options. As these constraints can be complex, fixing a configuration that violates one or more constraints can be challenging. Although several fix-generation approaches exist, their applicability is limited because (1) they typically generate only one fix, failing to cover the solution that the user wants; and (2) they do not fully support non-Boolean constraints, which contain arithmetic, inequality, and string operators. \\n\\nThis paper proposes a novel concept, range fix, for software configuration. A range fix specifies the options to change and the ranges of values for these options. We also design an algorithm that automatically generates range fixes for a violated constraint. We have evaluated our approach with three different strategies for handling constraint interactions, on data from five open source projects. Our evaluation shows that, even with the most complex strategy, our approach generates complete fix lists that are mostly short and concise, in a fraction of a second."

  "Affiliations": ["Iowa State University, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Code completion helps improve programming productivity. However, current support for code completion is limited to context-free code templates or a single method call of the variable on focus. Using libraries for development, developers often repeat API usages for certain tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce GraPacc, a graph-based pattern-oriented, context-sensitive code completion approach that is based on a database of API usage patterns. GraPacc manages and represents the API usage patterns of multiple variables, methods, and control structures via graph-based models. It extracts the context-sensitive features from the code, e.g. the API elements on focus or under modification, and their relations to other elements. The features are used to search and rank the patterns that are most fitted with the current code. When a pattern is selected, the current code will be completed via our novel graph-based code completion algorithm. Empirical evaluation on several real-world systems and human subjects shows that GraPacc has a high level of accuracy and a better level of usefulness than existing tools."

  "Authors": ["Fan Long", "Vijay Ganesh", "Michael Carbin", "Stelios Sidiroglou", "Martin Rinard"],
  "Affiliations": ["MIT, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Abstract—We present a novel technique, automatic input rectification, and a prototype implementation, SOAP. SOAP learns a set of constraints characterizing typical inputs that an application is highly likely to process correctly. When given an atypical input that does not satisfy these constraints, SOAP automatically rectifies the input (i.e., changes the input so that is satisfies the learned constraints). The goal is to automatically convert potentially dangerous inputs into typical inputs that the program is highly likely to process correctly. Our experimental results show that, for a set of benchmark applications (namely, Google Picasa, ImageMagick, VLC, Swfdec, and Dillo), this approach effectively converts malicious inputs (which successfully exploit vulnerabilities in the application) into benign inputs that the application processes correctly. Moreover, a manual code analysis shows that, if an input does satisfy the learned constraints, it is incapable of exploiting these vulnerabilities. We also present the results of a user study designed to evaluate the subjective perceptual quality of outputs from benign but atypical inputs that have been automatically rectified by SOAP to conform to the learned constraints. Specifically, we obtained benign inputs that violate learned constraints, used our input rectifier to obtain rectified inputs, then paid Amazon Mechanical Turk users to provide their subjective qualitative perception of the difference between the outputs from the original and rectified inputs. The results indicate that rectification can often preserve much, and in many cases all, of the desirable data in the original input."

  "Title": "Overcoming the Challenges in Cost Estimation for Distributed Software Projects",

  "Key": "icse12main-tt-131-ramasubbu",
  "Authors": ["Narayan Ramasubbu", "Rajesh Krishna Balan"],
  "Affiliations": ["Singapore Management University, Singapore"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe how we studied, in-situ, the operational processes of three large high process maturity distributed software development companies and discovered three common problems they faced with respect to early stage project cost estimation. We found that project managers faced significant challenges to accurately estimate project costs because the standard metrics-based estimation tools they used (a) did not effectively incorporate diverse distributed project configurations and characteristics, (b) required comprehensive data that was not fully available for all starting projects, and (c) required significant experience to derive accurate estimates. To address these problems, we collaborated with practitioners at all three firms and developed a new learning-oriented semi-automated early-stage cost estimation solution that was specifically designed for globally distributed software projects. The key idea of our solution was to augment the existing metrics-driven estimation methods with a case repository that stratified past incidents related to project effort estimation issues from the historical project databases at the firms into several generalizable categories. This repository allowed project managers to quickly and effectively \"benchmark\" their new projects to all past projects across the firms, and thereby learn from them. We deployed our solution at each of our three research sites for real-world field-testing over a period of six months. Project managers of 219 new large globally distributed projects used both our method to estimate the cost of their projects as well as the established metrics-based estimation approaches they were used to. Our approach achieved significantly reduced estimation errors (of up to 60%). This resulted in more than 20% net cost savings, on average, per project – a massive total cost savings across all projects at the three firms!"

  "Authors": ["Ding Yuan", "Soyeon Park", "Yuanyuan Zhou"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA / UC San Diego, USA", "UC San Diego, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Software logging is a conventional programming practice. As its efficacy is often important for users and developers to understand what have happened in production run, yet software logging is often done in an arbitrarily manner. So far, there have been little study for understanding logging practices in real world software. This paper makes the first attempt (to the best of our knowledge) to provide quantitative characteristic study of the current log messages within four pieces of large open-source software. First, we quantitatively show that software logging is pervasive. By examining developers’ own modifications to logging code in revision history, we find that they often do not make the log messages right in their first attempts, and thus need to spend significant amount of efforts to modify the log messages as after-thoughts. Our study further provides several interesting findings on where developers spend most of their efforts in modifying the log messages, which can give insights for programmers, tool developers, and language and compiler designers to improve the current logging practice. To demonstrate the benefit of our study, we built a simple checker based on one of our findings and effectively detected 138 new problematic logging code from studied software (24 of them are already confirmed and fixed by developers)."

  "Key": "icse12main-tt-227-lavallee",
  "Authors": ["Mathieu Lavallée", "Pierre N. Robillard"],
  "Affiliations": ["École Polytechnique de Montréal, Canada"],
  "Abstract": "This paper presents the results of a systematic review on the impacts of Software Process Improvement (SPI) on developers. This review selected 26 studies from the highest quality journals, conferences, and workshop in the field. The results were compiled and organized following the grounded theory approach. Results from the grounded theory were further categorized using the Ishikawa (or fishbone) diagram. The Ishikawa Diagram models all the factors potentially impacting software developers, and shows both the positive and negative impacts. Positive impacts include a reduction in the number of crises, and an increase in team communications and morale, as well as better requirements and documentation. Negative impacts include increased overhead on developers through the need to collect data and compile documentation, an undue focus on technical approaches, and the fact that SPI is oriented toward management and process quality, and not towards developers and product quality. This systematic review should support future practice through the identification of important obstacles and opportunities for achieving SPI success. Future research should also benefit from the problems and advantages of SPI identified by developers."

  "Key": "icse12main-tt-285-pankratius",
  "Authors": ["Victor Pankratius", "Felix Schmidt", "Gilda Garretón"],
  "Affiliations": ["KIT, Germany", "Oracle Labs, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Recent multi-paradigm programming languages combine functional and imperative programming styles to make software development easier. Given today's proliferation of multicore processors, parallel programmers are supposed to benefit from this combination, as many difficult problems can be expressed more easily in a functional style while others match an imperative style. Due to a lack of empirical evidence from controlled studies, however, important software engineering questions are largely unanswered. Our paper is the first to provide thorough empirical results by using Scala and Java as a vehicle in a controlled comparative study on multicore software development. Scala combines functional and imperative programming while Java focuses on imperative shared-memory programming. We study thirteen programmers who worked on three projects, including an industrial application, in both Scala and Java. In addition to the resulting 39 Scala programs and 39 Java programs, we obtain data from an industry software engineer who worked on the same project in Scala. We analyze key issues such as effort, code, language usage, performance, and programmer satisfaction. Contrary to popular belief, the functional style does not lead to bad performance. Average Scala run-times are comparable to Java, lowest run-times are sometimes better, but Java scales better on parallel hardware. We confirm with statistical significance Scala's claim that Scala code is more compact than Java code, but clearly refute other claims of Scala on lower programming effort and lower debugging effort. Our study also provides explanations for these observations and shows directions on how to improve multi-paradigm languages in the future."

  "Authors": ["Dacong Yan", "Guoqing Xu", "Atanas Rountev"],
  "Affiliations": ["Ohio State University, USA", "UC Irvine, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Many applications suffer from run-time bloat. excessive memory usage and work to accomplish simple tasks. Bloat significantly affects scalability and performance, and exposing it requires good diagnostic tools. We present a novel analysis that profiles the run-time execution to help programmers uncover potential performance problems. The key idea of the proposed approach is to track object references, starting from object creation statements, through assignment statements, and eventually statements that perform useful operations. This propagation is abstracted by a representation we refer to as a reference propagation graph. This graph provides path information specific to reference producers and their run-time contexts. Several client analyses demonstrate the use of reference propagation profiling to uncover run-time inefficiencies. We also present a study of the properties of reference propagation graphs produced by profiling 36 Java programs. Several cases studies discuss the inefficiencies identified in some of the analyzed programs, as well as the significant improvements obtained after code optimizations."

  "Authors": ["Shi Han", "Yingnong Dang", "Song Ge", "Dongmei Zhang", "Tao Xie"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research, China", "North Carolina State University, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Given limited resource and time before software release, development-site testing and debugging become more and more insufficient to ensure satisfactory software performance. As a counterpart for debugging in the large pioneered by the Microsoft Windows Error Reporting (WER) system focusing on crashing/hanging bugs, performance debugging in the large has emerged thanks to available infrastructure support to collect execution traces with performance issues from a huge number of users at the deployment sites. However, performance debugging against these numerous and complex traces remains a significant challenge for performance analysts. In this paper, to enable performance debugging in the large in practice, we propose a novel approach, called StackMine, that mines callstack traces to help performance analysts effectively discover highly impactful performance bugs (e.g., bugs impacting many users with long response delay). As a successful technology-transfer effort, since December 2010, StackMine has been applied in performance-debugging activities at a Microsoft team for performance analysis, especially for a large number of execution traces. Based on real-adoption experiences of StackMine in practice, we conducted an evaluation of StackMine on performance debugging in the large for Microsoft Windows 7. We also conducted another evaluation on a third-party application. The results highlight substantial benefits offered by StackMine in performance debugging in the large for large-scale software systems."

  "Abstract": "A goal of performance testing is to find situations when applications unexpectedly exhibit worsened characteristics for certain combinations of input values. A fundamental question of performance testing is how to select a manageable subset of the input data faster to find performance problems in applications automatically. \\n\\nWe offer a novel solution for finding performance problems in applications automatically using black-box software testing. Our solution is an adaptive, feedback-directed learning testing system that learns rules from execution traces of applications and then uses these rules to select test input data automatically for these applications to find more performance problems when compared with exploratory random testing. We have implemented our solution and applied it to a medium-size application at a major insurance company and to an open-source application. Performance problems were found automatically and confirmed by experienced testers and developers."

  "Abstract": "Customizable programs and program families provide user-selectable features to allow users to tailor a program to an application scenario. Knowing in advance which feature selection yields the best performance is difficult because a direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance based on selected features. However, when features interact, accurate predictions are challenging. An interaction occurs when a particular feature combination has an unexpected influence on performance. We present a method that automatically detects performance-relevant feature interactions to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we propose three heuristics to reduce the number of measurements required to detect interactions. Our evaluation consists of six real-world case studies from varying domains (e.g., databases, encoding libraries, and web servers) using different configuration techniques (e.g., configuration files and preprocessor flags). Results show an average prediction accuracy of 95%."

  "Authors": ["Gordon Fraser", "Andrea Arcuri"],
  "Affiliations": ["Saarland University, Germany", "Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],
  "Abstract": "Several promising techniques have been proposed to automate different tasks in software testing, such as test data generation for object-oriented software. However, reported studies in the literature only show the feasibility of the proposed techniques, because the choice of the employed artifacts in the case studies (e.g., software applications) is usually done in a non-systematic way. The chosen case study might be biased, and so it might not be a valid representative of the addressed type of software (e.g., internet applications and embedded systems). The common trend seems to be to accept this fact and get over it by simply discussing it in a threats to validity section. In this paper, we evaluate search-based software testing (in particular the EvoSuite tool) when applied to test data generation for open source projects. To achieve sound empirical results, we randomly selected 100 Java projects from SourceForge, which is the most popular open source repository (more than 300,000 projects with more than two million registered users). The resulting case study not only is very large (8,784 public classes for a total of 291,639 bytecode level branches), but more importantly it is statistically sound and representative for open source projects. Results show that while high coverage on commonly used types of classes is achievable, in practice environmental dependencies prohibit such high coverage, which clearly points out essential future research directions. To support this future research, our SF100 case study can serve as a much needed corpus of classes for test generation."

  "Affiliations": ["West Virginia University, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Ideally, we can learn lessons from software projects across multiple organizations. However, a major impediment to such knowledge sharing are the privacy concerns of software development organizations. This paper aims to provide defect data-set owners with an effective means of privatizing their data prior to release. We explore MORPH which understands how to maintain class boundaries in a data-set. MORPH is a data mutator that moves the data a random distance, taking care not to cross class boundaries. The value of training on this MORPHed data is tested via a 10-way within learning study and a cross learning study using Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression for ten object-oriented defect data-sets from the PROMISE data repository. Measured in terms of exposure of sensitive attributes, the MORPHed data was four times more private than the unMORPHed data. Also, in terms of the f-measures, there was little difference between the MORPHed and unMORPHed data (original data and data privatized by data-swapping) for both the cross and within study. We conclude that at least for the kinds of OO defect data studied in this project, data can be privatized without concerns for inference efficacy."

  "Authors": ["Hideaki Hata", "Osamu Mizuno", "Tohru Kikuno"],
  "Affiliations": ["Osaka University, Japan", "Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan"],
  "Abstract": "There have been many bug prediction models built with historical metrics, which are mined from version histories of software modules. Many studies have reported the effectiveness of these historical metrics. For prediction levels, most studies have targeted package and file levels. Prediction on a fine-grained level, which represents the method level, is required because there may be interesting results compared to coarse-grained (package and file levels) prediction. These results include good performance when considering quality assurance efforts, and new findings about the correlations between bugs and histories. However, fine-grained prediction has been a challenge because obtaining method histories from existing version control systems is a difficult problem. To tackle this problem, we have developed a fine-grained version control system for Java, Historage. With this system, we target Java software and conduct fine-grained prediction with well-known historical metrics. The results indicate that fine-grained (method-level) prediction outperforms coarse-grained (package and file levels) prediction when taking the efforts necessary to find bugs into account. Using a correlation analysis, we show that past bug information does not contribute to method-level bug prediction."

  "Affiliations": ["North Carolina State University, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Although useful and widely available, refactoring tools are underused. One cause of this underuse is that a developer sometimes fails to recognize that she is going to refactor before she begins manually refactoring. To address this issue, we conducted a formative study of developers’ manual refactoring process, suggesting that developers’ reliance on \"chasing error messages\" when manually refactoring is an error-prone manual refactoring strategy. Additionally, our study distilled a set of manual refactoring workflow patterns. Using these patterns, we designed a novel refactoring tool called BeneFactor. BeneFactor detects a developer’s manual refactoring, reminds her that automatic refactoring is available, and can complete her refactoring automatically. By alleviating the burden of recognizing manual refactoring, BeneFactor is designed to help solve the refactoring tool underuse problem."

  "Key": "icse12main-tt-498-foster",
  "Authors": ["Stephen R. Foster", "William G. Griswold", "Sorin Lerner"],
  "Affiliations": ["UC San Diego, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have come to perform a wide variety of tasks on behalf of the programmer, refactoring being a classic example. These operations have undeniable benefits, yet their large (and growing) number poses a cognitive scalability problem. Our main contribution is WitchDoctor -- a system that can detect, on the fly, when a programmer is hand-coding a refactoring. The system can then complete the refactoring in the background and propose it to the user long before the user can complete it. This implies a number of technical challenges. The algorithm must be 1) highly efficient, 2) handle unparseable programs, 3) tolerate the variety of ways programmers may perform a given refactoring, 4) use the IDE's proven and familiar refactoring engine to perform the refactoring, even though the the refactoring has already begun, and 5) support the wide range of refactorings present in modern IDEs. Our techniques for overcoming these challenges are the technical contributions of this paper. We evaluate WitchDoctor's design and implementation by simulating over 5,000 refactoring operations across three open-source projects. The simulated user is faster and more efficient than an average human user, yet WitchDoctor can detect more than 90% of refactoring operations as they are being performed -- and can complete over a third of refactorings before the simulated user does. All the while, WitchDoctor remains robust in the face of non-parseable programs and unpredictable refactoring scenarios. We also show that WitchDoctor is efficient enough to perform computation on a keystroke-by-keystroke basis, adding an average overhead of only 15 milliseconds per keystroke."

  "Abstract": "Though refactoring tools have been available for more than a decade, research has shown that programmers underutilize such tools. However, little is known about why programmers do not take advantage of these tools. We have conducted a field study on programmers in their natural settings working on their code. As a result, we collected a set of interaction data from about 1268 hours of programming using our minimally intrusive data collectors. Our quantitative data show that programmers prefer lightweight methods of invoking refactorings, usually perform small changes using the refactoring tool, proceed with an automated refactoring even when it may change the behavior of the program, and rarely preview the automated refactorings. We also interviewed nine of our participants to provide deeper insight about the patterns that we observed in the behavioral data. We found that programmers use predictable automated refactorings even if they have rare bugs or change the behavior of the program. This paper reports some of the factors that affect the use of automated refactorings such as invocation method, awareness, naming, trust, and predictability and the major mismatches between programmers' expectations and automated refactorings. The results of this work contribute to producing more effective tools for refactoring complex software."

  "Abstract": "Testing plug-in based systems is challenging due to complex interactions among many different plug-ins, and variations in version and configuration. The objective of this paper is to find out how developers address this test challenge. To that end, we conduct a qualitative (grounded theory) study, in which we interview 25 senior practitioners about how they test plug-ins and applications built on top of the Eclipse plug-in framework. The outcome is an overview of the testing practices currently used, a set of identified barriers limiting the adoption of test practices, and an explanation of how limited testing is compensated by self-hosting of projects and by involving the community. These results are supported by a structured survey of more than 150 professionals. The study reveals that unit testing plays a key role, whereas plug-in specific integration problems are identified and resolved by the community. Based on our findings, we propose a series of recommendations and areas for future research."

  "Abstract": "Research in program comprehension has considerably evolved over the past two decades. However, only little is known about how developers practice program comprehension under time and project pressure, and which methods and tools proposed by researchers are used in industry. This paper reports on an observational study of 28 professional developers from seven companies, investigating how developers comprehend software. In particular we focus on the strategies followed, information needed, and tools used. We found that developers put themselves in the role of end users by inspecting user interfaces. They try to avoid program comprehension, and employ recurring, structured comprehension strategies depending on work context. Further, we found that standards and experience facilitate comprehension. Program comprehension was considered a subtask of other maintenance tasks rather than a task by itself. We also found that face-to-face communication is preferred to documentation. Overall, our results show a gap between program comprehension research and practice as we did not observe any use of state of the art comprehension tools and developers seem to be unaware of them. Our findings call for further careful analysis and for reconsidering research agendas."

To identify the types of questions developers want answered when working with unfamiliar APIs and to understand the difficulty they may encounter answering those questions, we conducted a study involving twenty programmers working on different programming tasks, using unfamiliar APIs. Based on the screen captured videos and the verbalization of the participants, we identified twenty different types of questions programmers ask when working with unfamiliar APIs, and provide new insights to the cause of the difficulties programmers encounter when answering questions about the use of APIs. The questions we have identified and the difficulties we observed can be used for evaluating tools aimed at improving API learning, and in identifying areas of the API learning process where tool support is missing, or could be improved."

  "Abstract": "PHP web applications routinely generate invalid HTML. Modern browsers silently correct HTML errors, but sometimes malformed pages render inconsistently, cause browser crashes, or expose security vulnerabilities. Fixing errors in generated pages is usually straightforward, but repairing the generating PHP program can be much harder. We observe that malformed HTML is often produced by incorrect 'constant prints', i.e., statements that print string literals, and present two tools for automatically repairing such HTML generation errors. PHPQuickFix repairs simple bugs by statically analyzing individual prints. PHPRepair handles more general repairs using a dynamic approach. Based on a test suite, the property that all tests should produce their expected output is encoded as a string constraint over variables representing constant prints. Solving this constraint describes how constant prints must be modified to make all tests pass. Both tools were implemented as an Eclipse plugin and evaluated on PHP programs containing hundreds of HTML generation errors, most of which our tools were able to repair automatically."

  "Abstract": "Mining specifications and using them for bug detection is a promising way to reveal bugs in programs. Existing approaches suffer from two problems. First, dynamic specification miners require input that drives a program to generate common usage patterns. Second, existing approaches report false positives, that is, spurious warnings that mislead developers and reduce the practicability of the approach. We present a novel technique for dynamically mining and checking specifications without relying on existing input to drive a program and without reporting false positives. Our technique leverages automatically generated tests in two ways. Passing tests drive the program during specification mining, and failing test executions are checked against the mined specifications. The output are warnings that show with concrete test cases how the program violates commonly accepted specifications. Our implementation reports no false positives and 54 true positives in ten well-tested Java programs."

  "Abstract": "Atomicity, a general correctness criteria in concurrency programs, is often violated in real-world applications. What is worse is that the violations are difficult to be fixed by the developers, which makes the automatic bug fixing techniques attractive solutions. The state of the art aims at automating the manual fixing process and can not provide any theoretical reasoning and guarantees. We provide an automatic approach that applies the well-studied control theory to guarantee the maximal preservation of the concurrency degree of the original code and no introduction of deadlocks. Under the hood, we reduce the problem of violation fixing to a constraint solving problem using the petri net model. Our evaluation on 13 subjects shows that the slowdown incurred by our patches is only 40% of that of the state of the art. With the deadlock-free guarantee, our patches incur moderate overhead (around 10%), which is a worthwhile cost for safety."

  "Abstract": "Developers often copy, or clone, code in order to reuse or modify functionality. When they do so, they also clone any bugs in the original code. Or, different developers may independently make the same mistake. As one example of a bug, multiple products in a product line may use a component in a similar wrong way. This paper makes two contributions. First, it presents an empirical study of cloned buggy code. In a large industrial product line, about 4% of the bugs are duplicated across more than one product or file. In three open source projects (the Linux kernel, the Git version control system, and the PostgreSQL database) we found 282, 33, and 33 duplicated bugs, respectively. Second, this paper presents a tool, CBCD, that searches for code that is semantically identical to given buggy code. CBCD tests graph isomorphism over the Program Dependency Graph (PDG) representation and uses four optimizations. We evaluated CBCD by searching for known clones of buggy code segments in the three projects and compared the results with text-based, token-based, and AST-based code clone detectors, namely Simian, CCFinder, Deckard, and CloneDR. The evaluation shows that CBCD is fast when searching for possible clones of the buggy code in a large system, and it is more precise for this purpose than the other code clone detectors."

  "Abstract": "Large and medium scale software projects often require a source code revision control (RC) system. Unfortunately, RC systems do not perform well with obliviousness and quantification found in aspect-oriented code. When classes are oblivious to aspects, so is the RC system, and the crosscutting effect of aspects is not tracked. In this work, we study this problem in the context of using AspectJ (a standard AOP language) with Subversion (a standard RC system). We describe scenarios where the crosscutting effect of aspects combined with the concurrent changes that RC supports can lead to inconsistent states of the code. The work contributes a mechanism that checks-in with the source code versions of crosscutting metadata for tracking the effect of aspects. Another contribution of this work is the implementation of a supporting Eclipse plug-in (named XRC) that extends the JDT, AJDT, and SVN plug-ins for Eclipse to provide crosscutting revision control (XRC) for aspect-oriented programming."

In this paper, we propose an integrated approach to code history tracking for open source repositories. This approach takes a query code fragment as its input, and returns the code fragments containing the code clones with the query code. It utilizes publicly available code search engines as external resources. Based on this model, we have designed and implemented a prototype system named Ichi Tracker. Using Ichi Tracker, we have conducted three case studies. These case studies show the ancestors and descendents of the code, and we can recognize their evolution history."

  "Abstract": "Merge conflicts cause software defects which if detected late may require expensive resolution. This is especially true when developers work too long without integrating concurrent changes, which in practice is common as integration generally occurs at check-in. Awareness of others' activities was proposed to help developers detect conflicts earlier. However, it requires developers to detect conflicts by themselves and may overload them with notifications, thus making detection harder. This paper presents a novel solution that continuously merges uncommitted and committed changes to create a background system that is analyzed, compiled, and tested to precisely and accurately detect conflicts on behalf of developers, before check-in. An empirical study confirms that our solution avoids overloading developers and improves early detection of conflicts over existing approaches. Similarly to what happened with continuous compilation, this introduces the case for continuous merging inside the IDE."

  "Abstract": "In practice, it is common that a framework and its client programs evolve simultaneously. Thus, developers of client programs may need to migrate their programs to the new release of the framework when the framework evolves. As framework developers can hardly always guarantee backward compatibility during the evolution of a framework, migration of its client program is often time-consuming and error-prone. To facilitate this migration, researchers have proposed two categories of approaches to identification of framework evolution. operation-based approaches and matching-based approaches. To overcome the main limitations of the two categories of approaches, we propose a novel approach named HiMa, which is based on matching each pair of consecutive revisions recorded in the evolution history of the framework and aggregating revision-level rules to obtain framework-evolution rules. We implemented our HiMa approach as an Eclipse plug-in targeting at frameworks written in Java using SVN as the versioncontrol system. We further performed an experimental study on HiMa together with a state-of-art approach named AURA using six tasks based on three subject Java frameworks. Our experimental results demonstrate that HiMa achieves higher precision and higher recall than AURA in most circumstances and is never inferior to AURA in terms of precision and recall in any circumstances, although HiMa is computationally more costly than AURA."

  "Abstract": "Although popular text search engines allow users to retrieve similar web pages, source code search engines do not have this feature. Detecting similar applications is a notoriously difficult problem, since it implies that similar high-level requirements and their low-level implementations can be detected and matched automatically for different applications. We created a novel approach for automatically detecting Closely reLated ApplicatioNs (CLAN) that helps users detect similar applications for a given Java application. Our main contributions are an extension to a framework of relevance and a novel algorithm that computes a similarity index between Java applications using the notion of semantic layers that correspond to packages and class hierarchies. We have built CLAN and we conducted an experiment with 33 participants to evaluate CLAN and compare it with the closest competitive approach, MUDABlue. The results show with strong statistical significance that CLAN automatically detects similar applications from a large repository of 8,310 Java applications with a higher precision than MUDABlue."

Our technique classifies email lines in five categories (i.e., text, junk, code, patch, and stack trace) to allow one to subsequently apply ad hoc analysis techniques for each category. We evaluated our approach on a statistically significant set of emails gathered from mailing lists of four unrelated open source systems."

  "Abstract": "In the evolution of an operating system there is a continuing tension between the need to develop and test new features, and the need to provide a stable and secure execution environment to users. A compromise, adopted by the developers of the Linux kernel, is to release new versions, including bug fixes and new features, frequently, while maintaining some older 'longterm' versions. This strategy raises the problem of how to identify bug fixing patches that are submitted to the current version but should be applied to the longterm versions as well. The current approach is to rely on the individual subsystem maintainers to forward patches that seem relevant to the maintainers of the longterm kernels. The reactivity and diligence of the maintainers, however, varies, and thus many important patches could be missed by this approach. \\n\\nIn this paper, we propose an approach that automatically identifies bug fixing patches based on the changes and commit messages recorded in code repositories. We compare our approach with the keyword-based approach for identifying bug-fixing patches used in the literature, in the context of the Linux kernel. The results show that our approach can achieve a 53.19% improvement in recall as compared to keyword-based approaches, with similar precision."

  "Abstract": "Software clones have been widely studied in the recent literature and shown useful for finding bugs because inconsistent changes among clones in a clone group may indicate potential bugs. However, many inconsistent clone groups are not real bugs. The excessive number of false positives could easily impede broad adoption of clone-based bug detection approaches. \\n\\nIn this work, we aim to improve the usability of clonebased bug detection tools by increasing the rate of true positives found when a developer analyzes anomaly reports. Our idea is to control the number of anomaly reports a user can see at a time and actively incorporate incremental user feedback to continually refine the anomaly reports. Our system first presents top few anomaly reports from the list of reports generated by a tool in its default ordering. Users then either accept or reject each of the reports. Based on the feedback, our system automatically and iteratively refines a classification model for anomalies and re-sorts the rest of the reports. Our goal is to present the true positives to the users earlier than the default ordering. The rationale of the idea is based on our observation that false positives among the inconsistent clone groups could share common features (in terms of code structure, programming patterns, etc.), and these features can be learned from the incremental user feedback. \\n\\nWe evaluate our refinement process on three sets of clonebased anomaly reports from three large real programs. the Linux Kernel (C), Eclipse, and ArgoUML (Java), extracted by a clone-based anomaly detection tool. The results show that compared to the original ordering of bug reports, we can improve the rate of true positives found (i.e., true positives are found faster) by 11%, 87%, and 86% for Linux kernel, Eclipse, and ArgoUML, respectively."

  "Abstract": "CSS is a widely used language for describing the presentation semantics of HTML elements on the web. The language has a number of characteristics, such as inheritance and cascading order, which makes maintaining CSS code a challenging task for web developers. As a result, it is common for unused rules to be accumulated over time. Despite these challenges, CSS analysis has not received much attention from the research community. We propose an automated technique to support styling code maintenance, which (1) analyzes the runtime relationship between the CSS rules and DOM elements of a given web application (2) detects unmatched and ineffective selectors, overridden declaration properties, and undefined class values. Our technique, implemented in an open source tool called CILLA, has a high precision and recall rate. The results of our case study, conducted on fifteen open source and industrial web-based systems, show an average of 60% unused CSS selectors in deployed applications, which points to the ubiquity of the problem."

  "Abstract": "We exploit recent advances in analysis of graph topology to better understand software evolution, and to construct predictors that facilitate software development and maintenance. Managing an evolving, collaborative software system is a complex and expensive process, which still cannot ensure software reliability. Emerging techniques in graph mining have revolutionized the modeling of many complex systems and processes. We show how we can use a graph-based characterization of a software system to capture its evolution and facilitate development, by helping us estimate bug severity, prioritize refactoring efforts, and predict defect-prone releases. Our work consists of three main thrusts. First, we construct graphs that capture software structure at two different levels. (a) the product, i.e., source code and module level, and (b) the process, i.e., developer collaboration level. We identify a set of graph metrics that capture interesting properties of these graphs. Second, we study the evolution of eleven open source programs, including Firefox, Eclipse, MySQL, over the lifespan of the programs, typically a decade or more. Third, we show how our graph metrics can be used to construct predictors for bug severity, high-maintenance software parts, and failure-prone releases. Our work strongly suggests that using graph topology analysis concepts can open many actionable avenues in software engineering research and practice."

  "Abstract": "The paper presents an adaptive approach to perform impact analysis from a given change request to source code. Given a textual change request (e.g., a bug report), a single snapshot (release) of source code, indexed using Latent Semantic Indexing, is used to estimate the impact set. Should additional contextual information be available, the approach configures the best-fit combination to produce an improved impact set. Contextual information includes the execution trace and an initial source code entity verified for change. Combinations of information retrieval, dynamic analysis, and data mining of past source code commits are considered. The research hypothesis is that these combinations help counter the precision or recall deficit of individual techniques and improve the overall accuracy. The tandem operation of the three techniques sets it apart from other related solutions. Automation along with the effective utilization of two key sources of developer knowledge, which are often overlooked in impact analysis at the change request level, is achieved. \\n\\nTo validate our approach, we conducted an empirical evaluation on four open source software systems. A benchmark consisting of a number of maintenance issues, such as feature requests and bug fixes, and their associated source code changes was established by manual examination of these systems and their change history. Our results indicate that there are combinations formed from the augmented developer contextual information that show statistically significant improvement over stand-alone approaches."

In this paper, we aim at developing an approach for detecting smells that indicate weak points in a spreadsheet's design. To that end we first study code smells and transform these code smells to their spreadsheet counterparts. We then present an approach to detect the smells, and communicate located smells to spreadsheet users with data flow diagrams. We analyzed occurrences of these smells in the Euses corpus. Furthermore we conducted ten case studies in an industrial setting. The results of the evaluation indicate that smells can indeed reveal weaknesses in a spreadsheet's design, and that data flow diagrams are an appropriate way to show those weaknesses."

Here we address both questions by providing a model that eliminates or reduces control flow dependence and failure flow confounding bias within predicate-level statistical debuggers. We present empirical results demonstrating that our model significantly improves the effectiveness of a variety of predicate-level statistical debuggers, including those that eliminate or reduce only a single source of confounding bias."

  "Abstract": "A recent survey conducted among developers of the Apache, Eclipse, and Mozilla projects showed that the ability to recreate field failures is considered of fundamental importance when investigating bug reports. Unfortunately, the information typically contained in a bug report, such as memory dumps or call stacks, is usually insufficient for recreating the problem. Even more advanced approaches for gathering field data and help in-house debugging tend to collect either too little information, and be ineffective, or too much information, and be inefficient. To address these issues, we present BugRedux, a novel general approach for in-house debugging of field failures. BugRedux aims to synthesize, using execution data collected in the field, executions that mimic the observed field failures. We define several instances of BugRedux that collect different types of execution data and perform, through an empirical study, a cost-benefit analysis of the approach and its variations. In the study, we apply BugRedux to 16 failures of 14 real-world programs. Our results are promising in that they show that it is possible to synthesize in-house executions that reproduce failures observed in the field using a suitable set of execution data."

  "Abstract": "During the process of developing and maintaining a complex software system, developers pose detailed questions about the runtime behavior of the system. Source code views offer strictly limited insights, so developers often turn to tools like debuggers to inspect and interact with the running system. Unfortunately, traditional debuggers focus on the runtime stack as the key abstraction to support debugging operations, though the questions developers pose often have more to do with objects and their interactions. We propose object-centric debugging as an alternative approach to interacting with a running software system. We show how, by focusing on objects as the key abstraction, natural debugging operations can be defined to answer developer questions related to runtime behavior. We present a running prototype of an object-centric debugger, and demonstrate, with the help of a series of examples, how object-centric debugging offers more effective support for many typical developer tasks than a traditional stack-oriented debugger."

  "Abstract": "Pair Programming (PP) requires close collaboration and mutual engagement. Most existing empirical studies of PP do not focus on developers’ behaviour during PP sessions, and focus instead on the effects of PP such as productivity. However, disengagement, where a developer is not focusing on solving the task or understanding the problem and allows their partner to work by themselves, can hinder collaboration between developers and have a negative effect on their performance. This paper reports on an empirical study that investigates disengagement. Twenty-one industrial pair programming sessions were video and audio recorded and qualitatively analysed to investigate circumstances that lead to disengagement. We identified five reasons for disengagement. interruptions during the collaboration, the way the work is divided, the simplicity of the task involved, social pressure on inexperienced pair programmers, and time pressure. Our findings suggest that disengagement is sometimes acceptable and agreed upon between the developers in order to speed up problem solving. However, we also found episodes of disengagement where developers \"drop out\" of their PP sessions and are not able to follow their partner’s work nor contribute to the task at hand, thus losing the expected benefits of pairing. Analysis of sessions conducted under similar circumstances but where mutual engagement was sustained identified three behaviours that help to maintain engagement. encouraging the novice to drive, verbalisation and feedback, and asking for clarification."

  "Abstract": "We describe the evaluation of a build awareness system that assists agile software development teams to understand current build status and who is responsible for any build breakages. The system uses ambient awareness technologies, providing a separate, easily perceived communication channel distinct from standard team workflow. Multiple system configurations and behaviours were evaluated. An evaluation of the system showed that, while there was no significant change in the proportion of build breakages, the overall number of builds increased substantially, and the duration of broken builds decreased. Team members also reported an increased sense of awareness of, and responsibility for, broken builds and some noted the system dramatically changed their perception of the build process making them more cognisant of broken builds."

  "Abstract": "To survive and succeed, software projects need to attract and retain contributors. We model the individual's chances to become a valuable contributor through their capacity, willingness, and the opportunity to contribute at the time of joining. Using issue tracking data of Mozilla and Gnome, we find that the probability for a new joiner to become a Long Term Contributor (LTC) is associated with her willingness and environment. Specifically, during their first month, future LTCs tend to be more active and show more community-oriented attitude than other joiners. Joiners who start by commenting on instead of reporting an issue or ones who succeed to get at least one reported issue to be fixed, more than double their odds of becoming an LTC. The macro-climate with high project relative sociality and the micro-climate with a large, productive, and clustered peer group increase the odds. On the contrary, the macro-climate with high project popularity and the micro-climate with low attention from peers reduce the odds. This implies that the interaction between individual's attitude and project's climate are associated with the odds that an individual would become a valuable contributor or disengage from the project. Our findings may provide a basis for empirical approaches to design a better community architecture and to improve the experience of contributors."

  "Abstract": "A considerable part of software systems is comprised of functions that support the main modules, such as array or string manipulation and basic math computation. These auxiliary functions are usually considered less complex, and thus tend to receive less attention from developers. However, failures in these functions might propagate to more critical modules, thereby affecting the system's overall reliability. Given the complementary role of auxiliary functions, a question that arises is whether agile practices, such as pair programming and test-first programming, can improve their correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper presents an empirical assessment comparing the application of these agile practices with more traditional approaches. Our study comprises independent experiments of pair versus solo programming, and test-first versus test-last programming. The first study involved 85 novice programmers who applied both traditional and agile approaches in the development of six auxiliary functions within three different domains. Our results suggest that the agile practices might bring benefits in this context. In particular, pair programmers delivered correct implementations much more often, and test-first programming encouraged the production of larger and higher coverage test sets. On the downside, the main experiment showed that both practices significantly increase total development time. A replication of the test-first experiment with professional developers shows similar results."

  "Abstract": "Following the ``convention over configuration' paradigm, model-driven development (MDD) generates code to implement the ``default'' behaviour that has been specified by a template separate from the input model, reducing the decision effort of developers. For flexibility, users of MDD are allowed to customise the model and the generated code in parallel. A synchronisation of changed model or code is maintained by reflecting them on the other end of the code generation, as long as the traceability is unchanged. However, such invariant traceability between corresponding model and code elements can be violated either when (a) users of MDD protect custom changes from the generated code, or when (b) developers of MDD change the template for generating the default behaviour. A mismatch between user and template code is inevitable as they evolve for their own purposes. In this paper, we propose a two-layered invariant traceability framework that reduces the number of mismatches through bidirectional transformations. On top of existing vertical (model&lt;-&gt;code) synchronisations between a model and the template code, a horizontal (code&lt;-&gt;code) synchronisation between user and template code is supported, aligning the changes in both directions. Our blinkit tool is evaluated using the data set available from the CVS repositories of a MDD project. Eclipse MDT/GMF."

  "Abstract": "MATLAB Simulink is the most widely used industrial tool for developing complex embedded systems in the automotive sector. The resulting Simulink models often consist of more than ten thousand blocks and a large number of hierarchy levels. To ensure the quality of such models, automated static analyses and slicing are necessary to cope with this complexity. In particular, static analyses are required that operate directly on the models. In this article, we present an approach for slicing Simulink Models using dependence graphs and demonstrate its efficiency using case studies from the automotive and avionics domain. With slicing, the complexity of a model can be reduced for a given point of interest by removing unrelated model elements, thus paving the way for subsequent static quality assurance methods."

  "Abstract": "Model Transformation is considered an important enabling factor for Model Driven Development. Transformations can be applied not only for the generation of new models from existing ones, but also for the consistent co-evolution of software artifacts that pertain to various phases of software lifecycle such as requirement models, design documents and source code. Furthermore, it is often common in practical scenarios to apply such transformations repeatedly and frequently; an activity that can take a significant amount of time and resources, especially when the affected models are complex and highly interdependent. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach for deriving incremental model transformations by the partial evaluation of original model transformation programs. Partial evaluation involves pre-computing parts of the transformation program based on known model dependencies and the type of the applied model change. Such pre-evaluation allows for significant reduction of transformation time in large and complex model repositories. To evaluate the approach, we have implemented QvtMix, a prototype partial evaluator for the Query, View and Transformation Operational Mappings (QVT-OM) language. The experiments indicate that the proposed technique can be used for significantly improving the performance of repetitive applications of model transformations."

The highly incremental and iterative nature of software development nonetheless requires the ability to express uncertainty and reason with models containing it. In this paper, we build on our earlier work on expressing uncertainty using partial models, by elaborating an approach to reasoning with such models. We evaluate our approach by experimentally comparing it to traditional strategies for dealing with uncertainty as well as by conducting a case study using open source software. We conclude that we are able to reap the benefits of well-managed uncertainty while incurring minimal additional cost."

  "Abstract": "With modern multi-core architectures, web applications are usually configured to serve multiple requests simultaneously by spawning multiple instances. These instances may access the same external resources such as database tables and files. Such contentions may become severe during peak time, leading to violations of atomicity business logic. In this paper, we propose a novel static analysis that detects atomicity violations of external operations for server side scripts. The analysis differs from traditional atomicity violation detection techniques by focusing on external resources instead of shared memory. It consists of three components. The first one is an interprocedural and path-sensitive resource identity analysis that determines whether multiple operations access the same external resource, which is critical to identifying contentions. The second component infers pairs of external operations that should be executed atomically. Finally, violations are detected by reasoning about serializability of interleaved atomic pairs. Experimental results show that the analysis is highly effective in detecting atomicity violations in real-world web apps."

  "Abstract": "Validating code handling exceptional behavior is difficult, particularly when dealing with external resources that may be noisy and unreliable, as it requires. 1) the systematic exploration of the space of exceptions that may be thrown by the external resources, and 2) the setup of the context to trigger specific patterns of exceptions. In this work we present an approach that addresses those difficulties by performing an exhaustive amplification of the space of exceptional behavior associated with an external resource that is exercised by a test suite. Each amplification attempts to expose a program exception handling construct to new behavior by mocking an external resource so that it returns normally or throws an exception following a predefined pattern. Our assessment of the approach indicates that it can be fully automated, is powerful enough to detect 65% of the faults reported in the bug reports of this kind, and is precise enough that 77% of the detected anomalies correspond to faults fixed by the developers."

In the real deadlock confirmation phase, it uses a new strategy to actively schedule threads of an execution against the whole set of potential deadlock cycles. We have implemented a prototype and evaluated it on large-scale C/C++ programs. The experimental results confirm that our technique is significantly more effective and efficient than existing techniques."

A controlled experiment has been executed with 90 master students, who have performed several design tasks involving the hardening of a software architecture via security patterns. The results show that annotations produce benefits in terms of a reduced number of alternatives that need to be considered during the selection of a suitable pattern. However, they do not reduce the time spent in the selection process."

  "Abstract": "The software architectures of business, mission, or safety critical systems must be carefully designed to balance an exacting set of quality concerns describing characteristics such as security, reliability, and performance. Unfortunately, software architectures tend to degrade over time as maintainers modify the system without understanding the underlying architectural decisions. Although this problem can be mitigated by manually tracing architectural decisions into the code, the cost and effort required to do this can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper we therefore present a novel approach for automating the construction of traceability links for architectural tactics. Our approach utilizes machine learning methods and lightweight structural analysis to detect tactic-related classes. The detected tactic-related classes are then mapped to a Tactic Traceability Information Model. We train our trace algorithm using code extracted from fifteen performance-centric and safety-critical open source software systems and then evaluate it against the Apache Hadoop framework. Our results show that automatically generated traceability links can support software maintenance activities while preserving architectural qualities."

  "Abstract": "Build process is crucial in software development. However, the analysis support for build code is still limited. In this paper, we present SYMake, an infrastructure and tool for the analysis of build code in make. Due to the dynamic nature of make language, it is challenging to understand and maintain complex Makefiles. SYMake provides a symbolic evaluation algorithm that processes Makefiles and produces a symbolic dependency graph (SDG), which represents the build dependencies (i.e. rules) among files via commands. During the symbolic evaluation, for each resulting string value in an SDG that represents a part of a file name or a command in a rule, SYMake provides also an acyclic graph (called T-model) to represent its symbolic evaluation trace. We have used SYMake to develop algorithms and a tool 1) to detect several types of code smells and errors in Makefiles, and 2) to support build code refactoring, e.g. renaming a variable/target even if its name is fragmented and built from multiple substrings. Our empirical evaluation for SYMake's renaming on several real-world systems showed its high accuracy in entity renaming. Our controlled experiment showed that with SYMake, developers were able to understand Makefiles better and to detect more code smells as well as to perform refactoring more accurately."

  "Abstract": "Combinatorial problems appear in numerous settings, from timetabling to industrial design. Constraint solving aims to find solutions to such problems efficiently and automatically. Current constraint solvers are monolithic in design, accepting a broad range of problems. The cost of this convenience is a complex architecture, inhibiting efficiency, extensibility and scalability. Solver components are also tightly coupled with complex restrictions on their configuration, making automated generation of solvers difficult. \\n\\nWe describe a novel, automated, model-driven approach to generating efficient solvers tailored to individual problems and present some results from applying the approach. The main contribution of this work is a solver generation framework called Dominion, which analyses a problem and, based on its characteristics, generates a solver using components chosen from a library. The key benefit of this approach is the ability to solve larger and more difficult problems as a result of applying finer-grained optimisations and using specialised techniques as required."

  "Abstract": "Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering paradigm that exploits the commonality between similar software products to reduce life cycle costs and time-to-market. Many SPLs are critical and would benefit from efficient verification through model checking. Model checking SPLs is more difficult than for single systems, since the number of different products is potentially huge. In previous work, we introduced Featured Transition Systems (FTS), a formal, compact representation of SPL behaviour, and provided efficient algorithms to verify FTS. Yet, we still face the state explosion problem, like any model checking-based verification. Model abstraction is the most relevant answer to state explosion. In this paper, we define a novel simulation relation for FTS and provide an algorithm to compute it. We extend well-known simulation preservation properties to FTS and thus lay the theoretical foundations for abstraction-based model checking of SPLs. We evaluate our approach by comparing the cost of FTS-based simulation and abstraction with respect to product-by-product methods. Our results show that FTS are a solid foundation for simulation-based model checking of SPL."

These properties can aid programmers in refactoring, documenting, and debugging tasks by making dynamic patterns visible statically. Two useful forms of invariants involve relations among polynomials over program variables and relations among array variables. Current dynamic analysis methods support such invariants in only very limited forms. We combine mathematical techniques that have not previously been applied to this problem, namely equation solving, polyhedra construction, and SMT solving, to bring new capabilities to dynamic invariant detection. Using these methods, we show how to find equalities and inequalities among nonlinear polynomials over program variables, and linear relations among array variables of multiple dimensions. Preliminary experiments on 24 mathematical algorithms and an implementation of AES encryption provide evidence that the approach is effective at finding these invariants."

  "Abstract": "As the prevailing programming model of enterprise applications is becoming more declarative, programmers are spending an increasing amount of their time and efforts writing and maintaining metadata, such as XML or annotations. Although metadata is a cornerstone of modern software, automatic bug finding tools cannot ensure that metadata maintains its correctness during refactoring and enhancement. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents metadata invariants, a new abstraction that codifies various naming and typing relationships between metadata and the main source code of a program. We reify this abstraction as a domain-specific language. We also introduce algorithms to infer likely metadata invariants and to apply them to check metadata correctness in the presence of program evolution. We demonstrate how metadata invariant checking can help ensure that metadata remains consistent and correct during program evolution; it finds metadata-related inconsistencies and recommends how they should be corrected. Similar to static bug finding tools, a metadata invariant checker identifies metadata-related bugs as a program is being refactored and enhanced. Because metadata is omnipresent in modern software applications, our approach can help ensure the overall consistency and correctness of software as it evolves."

  "Abstract": "Missing requirements are known to be among the major causes of software failure. They often result from a natural inclination to conceive over-ideal systems where the software-to-be and its environment always behave as expected. Obstacle analysis is a goal-anchored form of risk analysis whereby exceptional conditions that may obstruct system goals are identified, assessed and resolved to produce complete requirements. Various techniques have been proposed for identifying obstacle conditions systematically. Among these, the formal ones have limited applicability or are costly to automate. This paper describes a tool-supported technique for generating a set of obstacle conditions guaranteed to be complete and consistent with respect to the known domain properties. The approach relies on a novel combination of model checking and learning technologies. Obstacles are iteratively learned from counterexample and witness traces produced by model checking against a goal and converted into positive and negative examples, respectively. A comparative evaluation is provided with respect to published results on the manual derivation of obstacles in a real safety-critical system for which failures have been reported."

We implemented this technique in a prototype system called ZESTI (Zero-Effort Symbolic Test Improvement), and applied it to three open-source code bases—GNU Coreutils, libdwarf and readelf—where it found 52 previously unknown bugs, many of which are out of reach of standard symbolic execution.

  "Abstract": "Testing multithreaded code is hard and expensive. Each multithreaded unit test creates two or more threads, each executing one or more methods on shared objects of the class under test. Such unit tests can be generated at random, but basic generation produces tests that are either slow or do not trigger concurrency bugs. Worse, such tests have many false alarms, which require human effort to filter out. We present BALLERINA, a novel technique for automatic generation of efficient multithreaded random tests that effectively trigger concurrency bugs. BALLERINA makes tests efficient by having only two threads, each executing a single, randomly selected method. BALLERINA increases chances that such a simple parallel code finds bugs by appending it to more complex, randomly generated sequential code. We also propose a clustering technique to reduce the manual effort in inspecting failures of automatically generated multithreaded tests. We evaluate BALLERINA on 14 real-world bugs from 6 popular codebases. Groovy, Java JDK, jFreeChart, Log4j, Lucene, and Pool. The experiments show that tests generated by BALLERINA can find bugs on average 2X-10X faster than various configurations of basic random generation, and our clustering technique reduces the number of inspected failures on average 4X-8X. Using BALLERINA, we found three previously unknown bugs in Apache Pool and Log4j, one of which was already confirmed and fixed."

  "Abstract": "Most test suite reduction techniques aim to select, from a given test suite, a minimal representative subset of test cases that retains the same code coverage as the suite. Empirical studies have shown, however, that test suites reduced in this manner may lose fault detection capability. Techniques have been proposed to retain certain redundant test cases in the reduced test suite so as to reduce the loss in fault-detection capability, but these still do concede some degree of loss. Thus, these techniques may be applicable only in cases where loose demands are placed on the upper limit of loss in fault-detection capability. In this work we present an on-demand test suite reduction approach, which attempts to select a representative subset satisfying the same test requirements as an initial test suite conceding at most l% loss in fault-detection capability for at least c% of the instances in which it is applied. Our technique collects statistics about loss in fault-detection capability at the level of individual statements and models the problem of test suite reduction as an integer linear programming problem. We have evaluated our approach in the contexts of three scenarios in which it might be used. Our results show that most test suites reduced by our approach satisfy given fault detection capability demands, and that the approach compares favorably with an existing test suite reduction approach."

  "Abstract": "Web application programmers must be aware of a wide range of potential security risks. Although the most common pitfalls are well described and categorized in the literature, it remains a challenging task to ensure that all guidelines are followed. For this reason, it is desirable to construct automated tools that can assist the programmers in the application development process by detecting weaknesses. Many vulnerabilities are related to web application code that stores references to application state in the generated HTML documents to work around the statelessness of the HTTP protocol. In this paper, we show that such client-state manipulation vulnerabilities are amenable to tool supported detection. We present a static analysis for the widely used frameworks Java Servlets, JSP, and Struts. Given a web application archive as input, the analysis identifies occurrences of client state and infers the information flow between the client state and the shared application state on the server. This makes it possible to check how client-state manipulation performed by malicious users may affect the shared application state and cause leakage or modifications of sensitive information. The warnings produced by the tool help the application programmer identify vulnerabilities. Moreover, the inferred information can be applied to configure a security filter that automatically guards against attacks. Experiments on a collection of open source web applications indicate that the static analysis is able to effectively help the programmer prevent client-state manipulation vulnerabilities."

  "Abstract": "Integer overflow bugs in C and C++ programs are difficult to track down and may lead to fatal errors or exploitable vulnerabilities. Although a number of tools for finding these bugs exist, the situation is complicated because not all overflows are bugs. Better tools need to be constructed---but a thorough understanding of the issues behind these errors does not yet exist. We developed IOC, a dynamic checking tool for integer overflows, and used it to conduct the first detailed empirical study of the prevalence and patterns of occurrence of integer overflows in C and C++ code. Our results show that intentional uses of wraparound behaviors are more common than is widely believed; for example, there are over 200 distinct locations in the SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks where overflow occurs. Although many overflows are intentional, a large number of accidental overflows also occur. Orthogonal to programmers' intent, overflows are found in both well-defined and undefined flavors. Applications executing undefined operations can be, and have been, broken by improvements in compiler optimizations. Looking beyond SPEC, we found and reported undefined integer overflows in SQLite, PostgreSQL, SafeInt, GNU MPC and GMP, Firefox, GCC, LLVM, Python, BIND, and OpenSSL; many of these have since been fixed. Our results show that integer overflow issues in C and C++ are subtle and complex, that they are common even in mature, widely used programs, and that they are widely misunderstood by developers."

  "Abstract": "Software systems inherently contain vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the past resulting in significant revenue losses. The study of vulnerability life cycles can help in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It can also help in designing future security policies and conducting audits of past incidents. Furthermore, such an analysis can help customers to assess the security risks associated with software products of different vendors. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory measurement study of a large software vulnerability data set containing 46310 vulnerabilities disclosed since 1988 till 2011. We investigate vulnerabilities along following seven dimensions. (1) phases in the life cycle of vulnerabilities, (2) evolution of vulnerabilities over the years, (3) functionality of vulnerabilities, (4) access requirement for exploitation of vulnerabilities, (5) risk level of vulnerabilities, (6) software vendors, and (7) software products. Our exploratory analysis uncovers several statistically significant findings that have important implications for software development and deployment."

  "Abstract": "Key program interfaces are sometimes documented with usage examples. concrete code snippets that characterize common use cases for a particular data type. While such documentation is known to be of great utility, it is burdensome to create and can be incomplete, out of date, or not representative of actual practice. We present an automatic technique for mining and synthesizing succinct and representative human-readable documentation of program interfaces. Our algorithm is based on a combination of path sensitive dataflow analysis, clustering, and pattern abstraction. It produces output in the form of well-typed program snippets which document initialization, method calls, assignments, looping constructs, and exception handling. In a human study involving over 150 participants, 82% of our generated examples were found to be at least as good at human-written instances and 94% were strictly preferred to state of the art code search."

  "Abstract": "Software reuse through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) is an integral part of software development. The functionality offered by an API is not always accessed uniformly throughout the lifetime of a client program. We propose Temporal API Usage Pattern Mining to detect API usage patterns in terms of their time of introduction into client programs. We detect concepts as distinct groups of API functionality from the change history of a client program. We locate those concepts in the client change history and detect temporal usage patterns, where a pattern contains a set of concepts that were added into the client program in a specific temporal order. We investigated the properties of temporal API usage patterns through a multiple-case study of three APIs and their use in up to 19 client software projects. Our technique was able to detect a number of valuable patterns in two out of three of the APIs investigated. Further investigation showed some patterns to be relatively consistent between clients, produced by multiple developers, and not trivially derivable from program structure or API documentation."

  "Abstract": "Application Programming Interface (API) documents are a typical way of describing legal usage of reusable software libraries, thus facilitating software reuse. However, even with such documents, developers often overlook some documents and build software systems that are inconsistent with the legal usage of those libraries. Existing software verification tools require formal specifications (such as code contracts), and therefore cannot directly verify the legal usage described in natural language text of API documents against the code using that library. However, in practice, most libraries do not come with formal specifications, thus hindering tool-based verification. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to infer formal specifications from natural language text of API documents. Our evaluation results show that our approach achieves an average of 92% precision and 93% recall in identifying sentences that describe code contracts from more than 2500 sentences of API documents. Furthermore, our results show that our approach has an average 83% accuracy in inferring specifications from over 1600 sentences describing code contracts."

  "Abstract": "Programmers extensively use application programming interfaces (APIs) to leverage existing libraries and frameworks. However, correctly and efficiently choosing and using APIs from unfamiliar libraries and frameworks is still a non-trivial task. Programmers often need to ruminate on API documentations (that are often incomplete) or inspect code examples (that are often absent) to learn API usage patterns. Recently, various techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem by creating API summarizations, mining code examples, or showing common API call sequences. However, few techniques focus on recommending API parameters. \\n\\nIn this paper, we propose an automated technique, called Precise, to address this problem. Differing from common code completion systems, Precise mines existing code bases, uses an abstract usage instance representation for each API usage example, and then builds a parameter usage database. Upon a request, Precise queries the database for abstract usage instances in similar contexts and generates parameter candidates by concretizing the instances adaptively. \\n\\nThe experimental results show that our technique is more general and applicable than existing code completion systems, specially, 64% of the parameter recommendations are useful and 53% of the recommendations are exactly the same as the actual parameters needed. We have also performed a user study to show our technique is useful in practice."

  "Abstract": "Natural languages like English are rich, complex, and powerful. The highly creative and graceful use of languages like English and Tamil, by masters like Shakespeare and Avvaiyar, can certainly delight and inspire. But in practice, given cognitive constraints and the exigencies of daily life, most human utterances are far simpler and much more repetitive and predictable. In fact, these utterances can be very usefully modeled using modern statistical methods. This fact has led to the phenomenal success of statistical approaches to speech recognition, natural language translation, question-answering, and text mining and comprehension. We begin with the conjecture that most software is also natural, in the sense that it is created by humans at work, with all the attendant constraints and limitations---and thus, like natural language, it is also likely to be repetitive and predictable. We then proceed to ask whether a) code can be usefully modeled by statistical language models and b) such models can be leveraged to support software engineers. Using the widely adopted n-gram model, we provide empirical evidence supportive of a positive answer to both these questions. We show that code is also very repetitive, and in fact even more so than natural languages. As an example use of the model, we have developed a simple code completion engine for Java that, despite its simplicity, already improves Eclipse's completion capability. We conclude the paper by laying out a vision for future research in this area."

  "Abstract": "Rapid prototypes are often developed early in the software development process in order to help project stakeholders explore ideas for possible features, and to discover, analyze, and specify requirements for the project. As prototypes are typically thrown-away following the initial analysis phase, it is imperative for them to be created quickly with little cost and effort. Tool support for finding and reusing components from open-source repositories offers a major opportunity to reduce this manual effort. In this paper, we present a system for rapid prototyping that facilitates software reuse by mining feature descriptions and source code from open-source repositories. Our system identifies and recommends features and associated source code modules that are relevant to the software product under development. The modules are selected such that they implement as many of the desired features as possible while exhibiting the lowest possible levels of external coupling. We conducted a user study to evaluate our approach and results indicated that it returned packages that implemented more features and were considered more relevant than the state-of-the-art approach."

  "Abstract": "Code completion menus have replaced standalone API browsers for most developers because they are more tightly integrated into the development workflow. Refinements to the code completion menu that incorporate additional sources of information have similarly been shown to be valuable, even relative to standalone counterparts offering similar functionality. In this paper, we describe active code completion, an architecture that allows library developers to introduce interactive and highly-specialized code generation interfaces, called palettes, directly into the editor. Using several empirical methods, we examine the contexts in which such a system could be useful, describe the design constraints governing the system architecture as well as particular code completion interfaces, and design one such system, named Graphite, for the Eclipse Java development environment. Using Graphite, we implement a palette for writing regular expressions as our primary example and conduct a small pilot study. In addition to showing the feasibility of this approach, it provides further evidence in support of the claim that integrating specialized code completion interfaces directly into the editor is valuable to professional developers."

  "Authors": ["Matt Staats", "Gregory Gay", "Mats P. E. Heimdahl"],

  "Abstract": "In testing, the test oracle is the artifact that determines whether an application under test executes correctly. The choice of test oracle can significantly impact the effectiveness of the testing process. However, despite the prevalence of tools that support the selection of test inputs, little work exists for supporting oracle creation. In this work, we propose a method of supporting test oracle creation. This method automatically selects the oracle data — the set of variables monitored during testing—for expected value test oracles. This approach is based on the use of mutation analysis to rank variables in terms of fault-finding effectiveness, thus automating the selection of the oracle data. Experiments over four industrial examples demonstrate that our method may be a cost-effective approach for producing small, effective oracle data, with fault finding improvements over current industrial best practice of up to 145.8% observed."

  "Abstract": "Mention test case, and it conjures up image of a script or a program that exercises a system under test. In industrial practice, however, test cases often start out as steps described in natural language. These are essentially directions a human tester needs to follow to interact with an application, exercising a given scenario. Since tests need to be executed repeatedly, such manual tests then have to go through test automation to create scripts or programs out of them. Test automation can be expensive in programmer time. We describe a technique to automate test automation. The input to our technique is a sequence of steps written in natural language, and the output is a sequence of procedure calls with accompanying parameters that can drive the application without human intervention. The technique is based on looking at the natural language test steps as consisting of segments that describe actions on targets, except that there can be ambiguity in the action itself, in the order in which segments occur, and in the specification of the target of the action. The technique resolves this ambiguity by backtracking, until it can synthesize a successful sequence of calls. We present an evaluation of our technique on professionally created manual test cases for two open-source web applications as well as a proprietary enterprise application. Our technique could automate over 82% of the steps contained in these test cases with no human intervention, indicating that the technique can reduce the cost of test automation quite effectively."

  "Abstract": "Abstract—Deterministic replay remains as one of the most effective ways to comprehend concurrent bugs. Existing approaches either maintain the exact shared read-write linkages with a large runtime overhead or use exponential off-line algorithms to search for a feasible interleaved execution. In this paper, we propose Stride, a hybrid solution that records the bounded shared memory access linkages at runtime and infers an equivalent interleaving in polynomial time, under the sequential consistency assumption. The recording scheme eliminates the need for synchronizing the shared read operations, which results in a significant overhead reduction. Comparing to the previous state-of-the-art approach of deterministic replay, Stride reduces, on average, 2.5 times of runtime overhead and produces, on average, 3.88 times smaller logs."

  "Abstract": "Software configurability has many benefits, but it also makes programs much harder to test, as in the worst case the program must be tested under every possible configuration. One potential remedy to this problem is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), in which typically the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array containing all t-way configuration option combinations. However, in a prior study we showed that several programs have important high-strength interactions (combinations of a subset of configuration options) that CIT is highly unlikely to generate in practice. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree) that aims to identify sets of configurations to test that are smaller than those generated by CIT, while also including important high-strength interactions missed by practical applications of CIT. On each iteration of iTree, we first use low-strength CIT to test the program under a set of configurations, and then apply machine learning techniques to discover new interactions that are potentially responsible for any new coverage seen. By repeating this process, iTree builds up a set of configurations likely to contain key high-strength interactions. We evaluated iTree by comparing the coverage it achieves versus covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets. Our results strongly suggest that iTree can identify high-coverage sets of configurations more effectively than traditional CIT or random sampling."

  "Abstract": "Distributed systems often contain many behaviorally similar processes, which are conveniently grouped into classes. In system modeling, it is common to specify such systems by describing the class level behavior, instead of object level behavior. While there have been techniques that mine specifications of such distributed systems from their execution traces, these methods only mine object-level specifications involving concrete process objects. This leads to specifications which are large, hard to comprehend, and sensitive to simple changes in the system (such as the number of objects). \\n\\nIn this paper, we develop a class level specification mining framework for distributed systems. A specification that describes interaction snippets between various processes in a distributed system forms a natural and intuitive way to document their behavior. Our mining method groups together such interactions between behaviorally similar processes, and presents a mined specification involving 'symbolic' Message Sequence Charts. Our experiments indicate that our mined symbolic specifications are significantly smaller than mined concrete specifications, while at the same time achieving better precision and recall."

  "Abstract": "Programmers using an API often must follow protocols that specify when it is legal to call particular methods. Several techniques have been proposed to find violations of such protocols based on mined specifications. However, existing techniques either focus on single-object protocols or on particular kinds of bugs, such as missing method calls. There is no practical technique to find multi-object protocol bugs without a priori known specifications. In this paper, we combine a dynamic analysis that infers multi-object protocols and a static checker of API usage constraints into a fully automatic protocol conformance checker. The combined system statically detects illegal uses of an API without human-written specifications. Our approach finds 41 bugs and code smells in mature, real-world Java programs with a true positive rate of 51%. Furthermore, we show that the analysis reveals bugs not found by state of the art approaches."

  "Abstract": "Contracts are a popular declarative specification technique to describe the behavior of stateful components in terms of pre/post conditions and invariants. Since each operation is specified separately in terms of an abstract implementation, it may be hard to understand and validate the resulting component behavior from contracts in terms of method interactions. In particular, properties expressed through algebraic axioms, which specify the effect of sequences of operations, require complex theorem proving techniques to be validated. In this paper, we propose an automatic small-scope based approach to synthesize incomplete behavioral abstractions for contracts expressed in the JFSL notation. The proposed abstraction technique enables the possibility to check that the contract behavior is coherent with behavioral properties expressed as axioms of an algebraic specifications. We assess the applicability of our approach by showing how the synthesis methodology can be applied to some classes of contract-based artifacts like specifications of data abstractions and requirement engineering models."

  "Abstract": "Client-side computation in web applications is becoming increasingly common due to the popularity of powerful client-side programming languages such as JavaScript. Client-side computation is commonly used to improve an application’s responsiveness by validating user inputs before they are sent to the server. In this paper, we present an analysis technique for checking if a client-side input validation function conforms to a given policy. In our approach, input validation policies are expressed using two regular expressions, one specifying the maximum policy (the upper bound for the set of inputs that should be allowed) and the other specifying the minimum policy (the lower bound for the set of inputs that should be allowed). Using our analysis we can identify two types of errors 1) the input validation function accepts an input that is not permitted by the maximum policy, or 2) the input validation function rejects an input that is permitted by the minimum policy. We implemented our analysis using dynamic slicing to automatically extract the input validation functions from web applications and using automata-based string analysis to analyze the extracted functions. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective in finding errors in input validation functions that we collected from real-world applications and from tutorials and books for teaching JavaScript."

Using these two cases helps illuminate the very diverse ways in which the growth of electronic networks partially transforms existing politico-economic orderings. They are extreme cases, one marked by hypermobility and the other by physical immobility. But they show us that each is only partly so. financial electronic networks are subject to particular types of embeddedness and local activist organizations can benefit from novel electronic potentials for global operation. I show how financial electronic networks and electronic activism reveal two parallel developments associated with particular technical properties of the new ICTs, but also reveal a third, radically divergent outcome, one I interpret as signaling the weight of the specific social logics of users in each case."

Based on this definition of sustainability, software could not only focus on green house gas reduction.

Among other aspects, this research has produced foundational work on the specification, analysis and component configuration of software architectures, including the development of associated software tools. However, adoption of the research by industry has been largely methodological rather than based on precise specifications in architecture description languages (ADLs) or rigorously underpinned by formal models of behaviour and non-functional attributes. Why is this? Why were the actual formalisms and tools not more widely adopted? Can we draw any lessons from this? In this talk, I hope to explore this further, drawing on my personal experience as a researcher in distributed software architectures. \\n\\nI particularly hope to tickle the fancy of the younger members of our community, indicating the excitement of research, the benefits of belonging to a vibrant research community such as ours, and the benefits of being an active contributor.

  "Abstract": "Cloud computing has today become a widespread practice for the provisioning of IT services. Cloud infrastructures provide the means to lease computational resources on demand, typically on a pay per use or subscription model and without the need for significant capital investment into hardware. With enterprises seeking to migrate their services to the cloud to save on deployment costs, cater for rapid growth or generally relieve themselves from the responsibility of maintaining their own computing infrastructures, a diverse range of services is required to help fulfil business processes. In this talk, we discuss some of the challenges involved in deploying and managing an ecosystem of loosely coupled cloud services that may be accessed through and integrate with a wide range of devices and third party applications. In particular, we focus on how projects such as OpenStack are accelerating the evolution towards a federated cloud service ecosystem. We also examine how the portfolio of existing and emerging standards such as OAuth and the Simple Cloud Identity Management framework can be exploited to seamlessly incorporate cloud services into business processes and solve the problem of identity and access management when dealing with applications exploiting services across organisational boundaries."

We started by performing an extensive analysis of the usage of specification patterns in published research case studies --- representing almost ten years of research in the area of specification, verification, and validation of SBAs. We then compared these patterns with a large body of specifications written by our industrial partner over a similar time period. The paper discusses the outcome of this comparison, indicating that some needs of the industry, especially in the area of requirements specification languages, are not fully met by current software engineering research."

But what if the runtime environment - a legacy Business Process Execution (BPE) platform - had to be replaced with a new solution? Several migration aspects must be taken into account. (1) Process models from the old BPE platform have to be converted to the target process definition language on the target BPE platform. (2) Existing Business Process Management (BPM) applications must be integrated via new BPE platform interfaces. (3) Process instances and process instance data state must be migrated. For each of these points an appropriate migration strategy must be chosen. This paper describes the migration methodology which was applied for the BPE platform renewal in Credit Suisse."

That power increases much faster than research into and published results about programming techniques can change. Meanwhile, practitioners still have to make a living by adding value in capital-constrained environments. How have practitioners taken advantage of the relative cheapness of processing power to add value more quickly, to reduce cost, manage risk and please customers and themsleves? And are there any signposts for where they might go next?"

  "Authors": ["Tom Sprenger"],
  "Affiliations": ["AdNovum Informatik, Switzerland"],
  "Abstract": "To be competitive in today's market, the IT industry faces many challenges in the development and maintenance of enterprise information systems. Engineering these largescaled systems efficiently requires making decisions about a number of issues. In addition, customer’s expectations imply continuous software delivery in predictable quality. The operation such systems demands for transparency of the software in regard to lifecycle, change and incident management as well as cost efficiency. Addressing these challenges, we learned how to benefit from traditional industries. Contrary to the fact that the IT business calls itself gladly an industry, the industrialization of software engineering in most cases moves on a rather modest level. Industrialization means not only to build a solution or product on top of managed and well-defined processes, but also to have access to structured information about the current conditions of manufacturing at any time. Comparably with test series and assembly lines of the automobile industry, each individual component and each step from the beginning of manufacturing up to the final product should be equipped with measuring points for quality and progress. Even one step further the product itself, after it has left the factory, should be able to continuously provide analytic data for diagnostic reasons. Information is automatically collected and builds the basic essentials for process control, optimization and continuous improvement of the software engineering process. This presentation shows by means of a practical experience report how AdNovum managed to build its software engineering based on a well-balanced system of processes, continuous measurement and control - as well as a healthy portion of pragmatism. We implemented an efficient and predictable software delivery pipeline based on five cornerstones that enables us to ship more than 1500 customer deliveries per year."

  "Type": "Invited Paper",

  "Authors": ["Wolfram Schulte"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Automated code analysis is technology aimed at locating, describing and repairing areas of weakness in code. Code weaknesses range from security vulnerabilities, logic errors, concurrency violations, to improper resource usage, violations of architectures or coding guidelines. Common to all code analysis techniques is that they build abstractions of code and then check those abstractions for properties of interest. For instance a type checker computes how types are used, abstract interpreters and symbolic evaluators check how values flow, model checkers analyze how state evolves. Building modern program analysis tools thus requires a multi-pronged approach to find a variety of weaknesses. In this talk I will discuss and compare several program analysis tools, which MSR build during the last ten years. They include theorem provers, program verifiers, bug finders, malware scanners, and test case generators. I will describe the need for their development, their innovation, and application. Many of these tools had considerable impact on Microsoft's development practices, as well as on the research community. Some of them are being shipped in products such as the Static Driver Verifier or as part of Visual Studio. Performing program analysis as part of quality assurance is meanwhile standard practice in many software development companies. However several challenges have not yet been resolved. Thus, I will conclude with a set of open challenges in program analysis which hopefully triggers new aspiring directions in our joint quest of delivering predictable software that is free from defect and vulnerabilities."

In this paper we report on the development process and management issues of this project, highlighting key success factors. We formulate a detailed descriptive model of its middle-out development process, and analyze the evolution and dependencies of code and proof artifacts. We compare our key findings on verification and re-verification with insights from other verification efforts in the literature. Our analysis of the project is based on complete access to project logs, meeting notes, and version control data over its entire history, including its long-term, ongoing maintenance phase. The aim of this work is to aid understanding of how to successfully run large-scale formal software verification projects."

  "Authors": ["Futoshi Iwama", "Taiga Nakamura", "Hironori Takeuchi"],
  "Affiliations": ["IBM Research, Japan"],
  "Abstract": "This paper describes a novel framework for creating a parser to process and analyze texts written in a ``partially structured'' natural language. In many projects, the contents of document artifacts tend to be described as a mixture of formal parts (i.e. the text constructs follow specific conventions) and parts written in arbitrary free text. Formal parsers, typically defined and used to process a description with rigidly defined syntax such as program source code are very precise and efficient in processing the formal part, while parsers developed for natural language processing (NLP) are good at robustly interpreting the free-text part. Therefore, combining these parsers with different characteristics can allow for more flexible and practical processing of various project documents. Unfortunately, conventional approaches to constructing a parser from multiple small parsers were studied extensively only for formal language parsers and are not directly applicable to NLP parsers due to the differences in the way the input text is extracted and evaluated. We propose a method to configure and generate a combined parser by extending an approach based on parser combinator, the operators for composing multiple formal parsers, to support both NLP and formal parsers. The resulting text parser is based on Parsing Expression Grammars, and it benefits from the strength of both parser types. We demonstrate an application of such combined parser in practical situations and show that the proposed approach can efficiently construct a parser for analyzing project-specific industrial specification documents."

  "Abstract": "This paper reports on the usage of a broad palette of formal modeling and analysis techniques on a regular industrial-size design of an ultra-modern satellite platform. These efforts were carried out in parallel with the conventional software development of the satellite platform. The model itself is expressed in a formalized dialect of AADL. Its formal nature enables rigorous and automated analysis, for which the recently developed COMPASS toolset was used. The whole effort revealed numerous inconsistencies in the early design documents, and the use of formal analyses provided additional insight on discrete system behavior (comprising nearly 50 million states), on hybrid system behavior involving discrete and continuous variables, and enabled the automated generation of large fault trees (66 nodes) for safety analysis that typically are constructed by hand. The model's size pushed the computational tractability of the algorithms underlying the formal analyses, and revealed bottlenecks for future theoretical research. Additionally, the effort led to newly learned practices from which subsequent formal modeling and analysis efforts shall benefit, especially when they are injected in the conventional software development lifecycle. The case demonstrates the feasibility of fully capturing a system-level design as a single comprehensive formal model and analyze it automatically using a toolset based on (probabilistic) model checkers."

  "Abstract": "Gaming companies now routinely apply data mining to their user data in order to plan the next release of their software. We predict that such software development analytics will become commonplace, in the near future. For example, as large software systems migrate to the cloud, they are divided and sold as dozens of smaller apps; when shopping inside the cloud, users are free to mix and match their apps from multiple vendors (e.g. Google Docs’ word processor with Zoho’s slide manager); to extend, or even retain, market share cloud vendors must mine their user data in order to understand what features best attract their clients. This panel will address the open issues with analytics. Issues addressed will include the following. What is the potential for software development analytics? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the current generation of analytics tools? How best can we mature those tools?"

  "Abstract": "A key piece of information in healthcare is a patient's benefit plan. It details which treatments and procedures are covered by the health insurer (or payer), and at which conditions. While the most accurate and complete implementation of the plan resides in the payer’s claims adjudication systems, the inherent complexity of these systems forces payers to maintain multiple repositories of benefit information for other service and regulatory needs. In this paper we present a technology that deals with this complexity. We show how a large US health payer benefited from using the visualization, search, summarization and other capabilities of the technology. We argue that this technology can be used to improve productivity and reduce error rate in the benefits administration workflow, leading to lower administrative overhead and cost for health payers, which benefits both payers and patients."

  "Abstract": "Program comprehension is a key activity through maintenance and evolution of large-scale software systems. The understanding of a program often requires the evolution analysis of individual functionalities, so-called features. The comprehension of evolving features is not trivial as their implementations are often tangled and scattered through many modules. Even worse, existing techniques are limited in providing developers with direct means for visualizing the evolution of features’ code. This work presents a proactive and interactive visualization strategy to enable feature evolution analysis. It proactively identifies code elements of evolving features and provides multiple views to present their structure under different perspectives. The novel visualization strategy was compared to a lightweight visualization strategy based on a tree-structure. We ran a controlled experiment with industry developers, who performed feature evolution comprehension tasks on an industrial-strength software. The results showed that the use of the proposed strategy presented significant gains in terms of correctness and execution time for feature evolution comprehension tasks."

  "Abstract": "Commercial static program analysis tools can be used to detect many defects that are common across applications. However, such tools currently have limited ability to reveal defects that are specific to individual projects, unless specialized checkers are devised and implemented by tool users. Developers do not typically exploit this capability. By contrast, defect mining tools developed by researchers can discover project-specific defects, but they require specialized expertise to employ and they may not be robust enough for general use. We present a hybrid approach in which a sophisticated dependence-based rule mining tool is used to discover project-specific programming rules, which are then transformed automatically into checkers that a commercial static analysis tool can run against a code base to reveal defects. We also present the results of an empirical study in which this approach was applied successfully to two large industrial code bases. Finally, we analyze the potential implications of this approach for software development practice."

  "Abstract": "At ICSE 2010, the Code Bubbles team from Brown University and the Code Canvas team from Microsoft Research presented similar ideas for new user experiences for an integrated development environment. Since then, the two teams formed a collaboration, along with the Microsoft Visual Studio team, to release Debugger Canvas, an industrial version of the Code Bubbles paradigm. With Debugger Canvas, a programmer debugs her code as a collection of code bubbles, annotated with call paths and variable values, on a two-dimensional pan-and-zoom surface. In this experience report, we describe new user interface ideas, describe the rationale behind our design choices, evaluate the performance overhead of the new design, and provide user feedback based on lab participants, post-release usage data, and a user survey and interviews. We conclude that the code bubbles paradigm does scale to existing customer code bases, is best implemented as a mode in the existing user experience rather than a replacement, and is most useful when the user has a long or complex call paths, a large or unfamiliar code base, or complex control patterns, like factories or dynamic linking."

An underlying aspect is the effectiveness of fixes. if a fair number of fixed bugs are reopened, it could indicate instability in the software system. To the best of our knowledge there has been on little prior work on understanding the dynamics of bug reopens. Towards that end, in this paper, we characterize when bug reports are reopened by using the Microsoft Windows operating system project as an empirical case study. Our analysis is based on a mixed-methods approach. First, we categorize the primary reasons for reopens based on a survey of 358 Microsoft employees. We then reinforce these results with a large-scale quantitative study of Windows bug reports, focusing on factors related to bug report edits and relationships between people involved in handling the bug. Finally, we build statistical models to describe the impact of various metrics on reopening bugs ranging from the reputation of the opener to how the bug was found."

  "Abstract": "Software often crashes. Once a crash happens, a crash report could be sent to software developers for investigation upon user permission. To facilitate efficient handling of crashes, crash reports received by Microsoft's Windows Error Reporting (WER) system are organized into a set of 'buckets'. Each bucket contains duplicate crash reports that are deemed as manifestations of the same bug. The bucket information is important for prioritizing efforts to resolve crashing bugs. To improve the accuracy of bucketing, we propose ReBucket, a method for clustering crash reports based on call stack matching. ReBucket measures the similarities of call stacks in crash reports and then assigns the reports to appropriate buckets based on the similarity values. We evaluate ReBucket using crash data collected from five widely-used Microsoft products. The results show that ReBucket achieves better overall performance than the existing methods. In average, the F-measure obtained by ReBucket is about 0.88."

All the available studies focus on the analysis of the effects of Pair Programming (e.g., code quality, development speed, etc.) with different findings and limited replicability of the experiments. This paper adopts a different approach that could be replicated in an easier way. it investigates how Pair Programming affects the way developers write code and interact with their development machine. In particular, the paper focuses on the effects that Pair Programming has on developers’ attention and productivity. The study was performed on a professional development team observed for ten months and it finds out that Pair Programming helps developers to eliminate distracting activities and to focus on productive activities."

  "Abstract": "Software development at Google is big and fast. The code base receives 20+ code changes per minute and 50% of the files change every month! Each product is developed and released from ‘head’ relying on automated tests verifying the product behavior. Release frequency varies from multiple times per day to once every few weeks, depending on the product team. With such a huge, fast-moving codebase, it is possible for teams to get stuck spending a lot of time just keeping their build ‘green’. A continuous integration system should help by providing the exact change at which a test started failing, instead of a range of suspect changes or doing a lengthy binary-search for the offending change. We have built a system that uses dependency analysis to determine all the tests a change transitively affects and then runs only those tests for every change. The system is built on top of Google’s cloud computing infrastructure enabling many builds to be executed concurrently, allowing the system to run affected tests as soon as a change is submitted. The use of smart tools and cloud computing infrastructure in the continuous integration system enables quick, effective feedback to development teams."

  "Abstract": "While testing is heavily used and largely automated in software development projects, the reuse of test practices across similar projects in a given domain is seldom systematized and supported by adequate methods and tools. This paper presents a practical approach that emerged from a concrete industrial case in the smart card domain at STMicroelectronics Belgium in order to better address this kind of challenge. The central concept is a test knowledge repository organized as a collection of specific patterns named QPatterns. A systematic process was followed, first to gather, structure and abstract the test practices, then to produce and validate an initial repository, and finally to make it evolve later on Testers can then rely on this repository to produce high quality test plans identifying all the functional and non-functional aspects that have to be addressed, as well as the concrete tests that have to be developed within the context of a new project. A tool support was also developed and integrated in a traceable way into the existing industrial test environment. The approach was validated and is currently under deployment at STMicroelectronics Belgium."

In the project Quamoco, we built a comprehensive approach with the aim to close this gap. \\n\\nFor this, we developed in several iterations a meta quality model specifying general concepts, a quality base model covering the most important quality factors and a quality assessment approach. The meta model introduces the new concept of a product factor, which bridges the gap between concrete measurements and abstract quality aspects. Product factors have measures and instruments to operationalise quality by measurements from manual inspection and tool analysis. The base model uses the ISO 25010 quality attributes, which we refine by 200 factors and 600 measures for Java and C# systems. \\n\\nWe found in several empirical validations that the assessment results fit to the expectations of experts for the corresponding systems. The empirical analyses also showed that several of the correlations are statistically significant and that the maintainability part of the base model has the highest correlation, which fits to the fact that this part is the most comprehensive. Although we still see room for extending and improving the base model, it shows a high correspondence with expert opinions and hence is able to form the basis for repeatable and understandable quality assessments in practice."

  "Abstract": "As smartphones become popular, manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics are developing smartphones with rich functionality such as a camera and photo editing quickly, which accelerates the adoption of open source applications in the smartphone platforms. However, developers often do not know the detail of open source applications, because they did not develop the applications themselves. Thus, it is a challenging problem to test open source applications effectively in short time. This paper reports our experience of applying concolic testing technique to test libexif, an open source library to manipulate EXIF information in image files. We have demonstrated that concolic testing technique is effective and efficient at detecting bugs with modest effort in industrial setting. We also compare two concolic testing tools, CREST-BV and KLEE, in this testing project. Furthermore, we compare the concolic testing results with the analysis result of the Coverity Prevent static analyzer. We detected a memory access bug, a null pointer dereference bug, and four divide-by-zero bugs in libexif through concolic testing, none of which were detected by Coverity Prevent."

The course relies on continuous integration and automated metrics, that coalesce frequently updated information in a manner that is visible to students and can be monitored by a small number of staff. The course is supported by a just-in-time teaching programme of thirty-two technical topics.

We have examined all known secondary studies published up to the end of 2009, together with those published in major journals to mid-2011, and identified where these provide practical results that are relevant to student needs. Results. Starting with 145 candidate systematic literature reviews (SLRs), we were able to identify and classify potentially useful teaching material from 43 of them. Conclusions. EBSE can potentially lend authority to our teaching, although the coverage of key topics is uneven. Additionally, mapping studies can provide support for research-led teaching."

  "Abstract": "Siemens Corporate Development Center India (CT DC IN) develops software applications for the industry, energy, health-care, and infrastructure &amp; cities sectors of Siemens. These applications are typically critical in nature and require software practitioners who have considerable competency in the area of software engineering. To enhance the competency of engineers, CT DC IN has introduced an internal curriculum titled 'FOundation CUrriculum for Software engineers' (FOCUS) which is an adapted version of IEEE's SWEBOK curriculum. The FOCUS program has been used to train more than 500 engineers in the last three years. In this experience report, we describe the motivation for FOCUS, how it was structured to address the specific needs of CT DC IN, and how the FOCUS program was rolled out within the organization. We also provide results obtained from a survey of the FOCUS participants, their managers, and FOCUS trainers that was conducted to throw light on the effectiveness of the program. We believe the insights from the survey results provide useful pointers to other organizations and academic institutions that are planning to adopt a SWEBOK-based curriculum."

  "Abstract": "The most effective setting for training in Global Software Engineering is to provide a distributed environment for students. In such an environment, students will meet challenges in recognizing problems first-hand. Teaching in a distributed environment is, however, very demanding, challenging and unpredictable compared to teaching in a local environment. Based on nine years of experience, in this paper we present the most important issues that should be taken into consideration to increase the probability of success in teaching a Global Software Engineering course."

Based on data collected from fourteen distributed student projects, a set of collaboration patterns is identified and their causes and implications described. Collaboration patterns are a result of the analysis of collaboration links within distributed student teams, and can assist teachers in better understanding of the dynamics found in distributed projects."

  "Abstract": "Handling large-sized classes and maintaining students’ involvement are two of the major challenges in Personal Software Process (PSP) education in universities. In order to tackle these two challenges, we adapted and incorporated some typical practices of Pair Programming (PP) into the PSP class at summer school in Software Institute of Nanjing University in 2010, and received positive results, such as higher students’ involvement, and conformity of process discipline, as well as (half) workload reduction in evaluating assignments. However, the experiment did not confirm the improved performance of the paired students as expected. Based on the experience and feedbacks, we improved this approach in our PSP course in 2011. Accordingly, by analyzing the previous experiment results, we redesigned the experiment with a number of improvements, such as lab environment, evaluation methods and student selection, to further investigate the effects of this approach in PSP education, in particular students’ performance. We also introduced several new metrics to enable the comparison analysis of the data collected from both paired students and solo students. The new experiment confirms the value of pairing practices in PSP education. The results show that in PSP class, compared to solo students, paired students can achieve better performance in terms of program quality and exam scores."

We present an approach to detect the current activity of software developers and if they are facing a problem. By observing developer actions like changing code or searching the web, we detect whether developers are locating the cause of a problem, searching for a solution, or applying a solution. We model development work as recurring problem solution cycle, detect developer’s actions by instrumenting the IDE, translate developer actions to observations using ontologies, and infer developer activities by using Hidden Markov Models. In a preliminary evaluation, our approach was able to correctly detect 72% of all activities. However, a broader more reliable evaluation is still needed."

The KM technique of \"knowledge mapping\" was used as a research technique to characterize knowledge flow. Results show that such mitigation or removal was acknowledged by project team members as having the potential for lowering project labor cost, improving schedule adherence, and enhancing final product quality."

  "Abstract": "Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) have received great attention in recent years and are expected to play a big role in the future of software engineering as processes become more view-centric. However, they are a 'two-edged sword'. While they provide strong support for communication within communities, allowing experts to express themselves using concepts tailored to their exact needs, they are a poor vehicle for communication across communities because of their lack of common, transcending concepts. In contrast, General-Purpose Modeling Languages (GPMLs) have the opposite problem - they are poor at the former but good at the latter. The value of models in software engineering would therefore be significantly boosted if the advantages of DSMLs and GPMLs could be combined and models could be viewed in a domain-specific or general-purpose way depending on the needs of the user. In this paper we present an approach for achieving such a synergy based on the orthogonal classification architecture. In this architecture model elements have two classifiers. a linguistic one representing their 'general-purpose' and an ontological one representing their 'domain-specific' type. By associating visualization symbols with both classifiers it is possible to support two concrete syntaxes at the same time and allow the domain-specific and general-purpose notation to support each other - that is, to form a symbiotic relationship."

  "Abstract": "Text retrieval approaches have been used to address many software engineering tasks. In most cases, their use involves issuing a textual query to retrieve a set of relevant software artifacts from the system. The performance of all these approaches depends on the quality of the given query (i.e., its ability to describe the information need in such a way that the relevant software artifacts are retrieved during the search). Currently, the only way to tell that a query failed to lead to the expected software artifacts is by investing time and effort in analyzing the search results. In addition, it is often very difficult to ascertain what part of the query leads to poor results. We propose a novel pre-retrieval metric, which reflects the quality of a query by measuring the specificity of its terms. We exemplify the use of the new specificity metric on the task of concept location in source code. A preliminary empirical study shows that our metric is a good effort predictor for text retrieval-based concept location, outperforming existing techniques from the field of natural language document retrieval."

Maintenance of these complex systems, however, still relies on adaptation mechanisms that remain unaware of the prevailing user collaboration patterns. Consequently, a system cannot react to changes in the interaction behavior thereby impeding the collaboration's evolution. In this paper, we make the case for a human architecture model and its mapping onto software architecture elements as fundamental building blocks for system adaptation."

Along the way, the interviews provide insight into the state of release engineering today, and interesting relationships between software architecture and release processes."

The augmentation of software engineers’ intellectual capabilities is proposed as a third complement to the traditional focus of methodologies on the process and environmental factors of the software development endeavor. I argue that these capabilities have been shown to be open to improvement through the practices traditionally used in spiritual traditions, but now used increasingly in other fields of knowledge work, such as in the medical profession and the education field. Historically, the intellectual capabilities of software engineers have been treated as a given within any particular software development effort. This is argued to be an aspect ripe for inclusion within software development methodologies."

The common idea behind these techniques is to use bad hashing to get a quick answer. We report on a case study, the Squeaksource ecosystem, which features thousands of software projects, with more than 40 million versions of methods, across more than seven years of evolution. We provide estimates for the prevalence of type-1, type-2, and type-3 clones in Squeaksource."

As web applications adopt input sanitization routines to prevent web security risks, static code attributes that represent the characteristics of these routines may be useful for predicting web application vulnerabilities. In this paper, we classify various input sanitization methods into different types and propose a set of static code attributes that represent these types. Then we use data mining methods to predict SQL injection and cross site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications. Preliminary experiments show that our proposed attributes are important indicators of such vulnerabilities."

  "Abstract": "Fixing defects is an essential software development activity. For commercial software vendors, the time to repair defects in deployed business-critical software products or applications is a key quality metric for sustained customer satisfaction. In this paper, we report on the analysis of about 1,500 defect records from an IBM middle-ware product collected over a five-year period. The analysis includes a characterization of each repaired defect by topic and a ranking of developers by inferred expertise on each topic. We find clear evidence that defect resolution time is strongly influenced by the specific developer and his/her expertise in the defect's topic. To validate our approach, we conducted interviews with the product’s manager who provided us with his own ranking of developer expertise for comparison. We argue that our automated developer expertise ranking can be beneficial in the planning of a software project and is applicable beyond software support in the other phases of the software lifecycle."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Alberta, Canada"],
  "Abstract": "Power consumption is increasingly becoming a concern for not only electrical engineers, but for software engineers as well, due to the increasing popularity of new power-limited contexts such as mobile-computing, smart-phones and cloud-computing. Software changes can alter software power consumption behaviour and can cause power performance regressions. By tracking software power consumption we can build models to provide suggestions to avoid power regressions. There is much research on software power consumption, but little focus on the relationship between software changes and power consumption. Most work measures the power consumption of a single software task; instead we seek to extend this work across the history (revisions) of a project. We develop a set of tests for a well established product and then run those tests across all versions of the product while recording the power usage of these tests. We provide and demonstrate a methodology that enables the analysis of power consumption performance for over 500 nightly builds of Firefox 3.6; we show that software change does induce changes in power consumption. This methodology and case study are a first step towards combining power measurement and mining software repositories research, thus enabling developers to avoid power regressions via power consumption awareness."

  "Abstract": "Software behavior learning is an important task in software engineering. Software behavior is usually represented as a program execution. It is expected that similar executions have similar behavior, i.e. revealing the same faults. Single-label learning has been used to assign a single label (fault) to a failing execution in the existing efforts. However, a failing execution may be caused by several faults simultaneously. Hence, it needs to assign multiple labels to support software engineering tasks in practice. In this paper, we present multi-label software behavior learning. A well-known multi-label learning algorithm ML-KNN is introduced to achieve comprehensive learning of software behavior. We conducted a preliminary experiment on two industrial programs. flex and grep. The experimental results show that multi-label learning can produce more precise and complete results than single-label learning."

Relating the observed evolutionary trends to principles and laws of software design enables a high-level assessment of tendencies in the underlying design quality."

  "Abstract": "Online social networks are now common place in day-to-day lives. They are also increasingly used to drive social action initiatives, either led by government or communities themselves (e.g., SeeClickFix, LoveLewisham.org, mumsnet). However, such initiatives are mainly used for crowd sourcing community views or coordinating activities. With the changing global economic and political landscape, there is an ever pressing need to engage citizens on a large-scale, not only in consultations about systems that affect them, but also involve them directly in the design of these very systems. In this paper we present the UDesignIt platform that combines social media technologies with software engineering concepts to empower communities to discuss and extract high-level design features. It combines natural language processing, feature modelling and visual overlays in the form of ``image clouds'' to enable communities and software engineers alike to unlock the knowledge contained in the unstructured and unfiltered content of social media where people discuss social problems and their solutions. By automatically extracting key themes and presenting them in a structured and organised manner in near real-time, the approach drives a shift towards large-scale engagement of community stakeholders for system design."

  "Abstract": "Software Engineering challenges and contests are becoming increasingly popular for focusing researchers' efforts on particular problems. Such contests tend to follow either an exploratory model, in which the contest holders provide data and ask the contestants to discover ``interesting things'' they can do with it, or task-oriented contests in which contestants must perform a specific task on a provided dataset. Only occasionally do contests provide more rigorous evaluation mechanisms that precisely specify the task to be performed and the metrics that will be used to evaluate the results. In this paper, we propose actionable and crowd-sourced contests. actionable because the contest describes a precise task, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and also provides a downloadable operating environment for the contest; and crowd-sourced because providing these features creates accessibility to Information Technology hobbyists and students who are attracted by the challenge. Our proposed approach is illustrated using research challenges from the software traceability area as well as an experimental workbench named TraceLab."

In this paper we propose an approach based on a story-telling visualization, which is designed to entice engineers to share and document their tribal memory. Sticky notes can be used to share memories of a system's lifetime events, such as past design rationales but also more casual memories like pictures from after-work beer or a hackathon. We present an early-stage prototype implementation and include two design studies created using that prototype."

A modeling language called PMA is defined to specify such kind of systems, and LTL property and logic of knowledge combined with probabilistic requirements are supported to analyze system behaviors. Initial evaluation indicates the effectiveness of our current progress; meanwhile some challenges and possible solutions are discussed as our ongoing work."

To address this, we propose BRACE, a framework that simplifies the process by enabling developers to correlate cyber (i.e., logical) and physical properties of the system via assertions. This paper presents our initial investigation into the requirements and semantics of such assertions, which we call CPS assertions. We discusses our experience implementing and using the framework with a mobile robot, and highlight key future research challenges."

Recommendations for each code location are typically computed independently of the other locations. We propose that an IDE should consider the whole codebase, not just the local context, before offering recommendations for a particular location. We demonstrate the potential benefits of our technique by presenting four concrete scenarios in which the Eclipse IDE fails to provide proper Quick Fixes at relevant locations, even though it offers those fixes at other locations. We describe a technique that can augment an existing IDE’s recommendations to account for non-local information. For example, when some compilation errors depend on others, our technique helps the developer decide which errors to resolve first."

  "Abstract": "Modern software systems need to be continuously available under varying conditions. Their ability to dynamically adapt to their execution context is thus increasingly seen as a key to their success. Recently, many approaches were proposed to design and support the execution of Dynamically Adaptive Systems (DAS). However, the ability of a DAS to evolve is limited to the addition, update or removal of adaptation rules or reconfiguration scripts. These artifacts are very specific to the control loop managing such a DAS and runtime evolution of the DAS requirements may affect other parts of the DAS. In this paper, we argue to evolve all parts of the loop. We suggest leveraging recent advances in model-driven techniques to offer an approach that supports the evolution of both systems and their adaptation capabilities. The basic idea is to consider the control loop itself as an adaptive system."

To this end, we provide makeSense. a unified programming framework and a compilation chain that, from high-level business process specifications, generates code ready for deployment on WSN nodes."

  "Affiliations": ["Iowa State University, USA / California Institute of Technology, USA", "Iowa State University, USA"],
  "Abstract": "We propose an extension of van Lamsweerde’s goal-oriented requirements engineering to the domain of programmable DNA nanotechnology. This is a domain in which individual devices (agents) are at most a few dozen nanometers in diameter. These devices are programmed to assemble themselves from molecular components and perform their assigned tasks. The devices carry out their tasks in the probabilistic world of chemical kinetics, so they are individually error-prone. However, the number of devices deployed is roughly on the order of a nanomole, and some goals are achieved when enough of these agents achieve their assigned subgoals. We show that it is useful in this setting to augment the AND/OR goal diagrams to allow goal refinements that are mediated by threshold functions, rather than ANDs or ORs. We illustrate this method by engineering requirements for a system of molecular detectors (DNA origami \"pliers\" that capture target molecules) invented by Kuzuya, Sakai, Yamazaki, Xu, and Komiyama (2011). We model this system in the Prism probabilistic symbolic model checker, and we use Prism to verify that requirements are satisfied. This gives prima facie evidence that software engineering methods can be used to make DNA nanotechnology more productive, predictable and safe."

  "Abstract": "When software developers need to exchange information or coordinate work with colleagues on other teams, they are often faced with the challenge of finding the right person to communicate with. In this paper, we present our tool, called CARES (Colleagues and Relevant Engineers’ Support), which is an integrated development environment-based (IDE) tool that enables engineers to easily discover and communicate with the people who have contributed to the source code. CARES has been deployed to 30 professional developers, and we interviewed 8 of them after 3 weeks of evaluation. They reported that CARES helped them to more quickly find, choose, and initiate contact with the most relevant and expedient person who could address their needs."

  "Authors": ["Itai Segall", "Rachel Tzoref-Brill"],
  "Affiliations": ["IBM Research, Israel"],
  "Abstract": "Combinatorial test design (CTD) is an effective test planning technique that reveals faulty feature interactions in a given system. The test space is modeled by a set of parameters, their respective values, and restrictions on the value combinations. A subset of the test space is then automatically constructed so that it covers all valid value combinations of every $t$ parameters, where $t$ is a user input. \\n\\nWhen applying CTD to real-life testing problems, it can often occur that the result of CTD cannot be used as is, and manual modifications to the tests are performed. One example is very limited resources that significantly reduce the number of tests that can be used. Another example is complex restrictions that are not captured in the model of the test space. The main concern is that manually modifying the result of CTD might potentially introduce coverage gaps that the user is unaware of. In this paper we present a tool that supports interactive modification of a combinatorial test plan, both manually and with tool assistance. For each modification, the tool displays the new coverage gaps that will be introduced, and enables the user to take educated decisions on what to include in the final set of tests."

However, extending an IDE is still a possibility restricted to developers with deep knowledge about the specific development environment and its architecture. In this paper we present MASH, a tool that eases the programming of Integrated Development Environments. The tool supports the definition of workflows that can be quickly designed to integrate functionalities offered by multiple plug-ins, without the need of knowing anything about the internal architecture of the IDE. Workflows can be easily reshaped every time an analysis must be modified, without the need of producing Java code and deploying components in the IDE. Early results suggest that this approach can effectively facilitate programming of IDEs."

Monitoring functional properties is particularly useful in an open environment in which there is a distributed ownership of a software system. Parts of the system may be changed independently and therefore it becomes necessary to monitor the component’s behavior at run time."

It then ranks the relevant API usage patterns and auto-completes the current code with the proper elements according to the chosen pattern."

However, focusing only on source code can lead to unrealistic or irrelevant test cases, while only exploring a user interface often misses much of the underlying program behavior. Our EXSYST prototype takes a new approach by exploring user interfaces while aiming to maximize code coverage, thus combining the best of both worlds. Experiments show that such an approach can achieve high code coverage matching and exceeding the code coverage of traditional unit-based test generators; yet, by construction every test case is realistic and relevant, and every detected failure can be shown to be caused by a real sequence of input events."

Of particular importance are parametric monitoring systems, which allow the specification of properties that relate objects in a program, rather than only global properties. In the past decade, a number of parametric runtime monitoring systems have been developed. Here we give a demonstration of our system, JavaMOP. It is the only parametric monitoring system that allows multiple differing logical formalisms. It is also the most efficient in terms of runtime overhead, and very competitive with respect to memory usage."

Given the abundance of repository data, scaling up MSR analyses has become a major challenge. Recently, researchers have experimented with conventional techniques like a super-computer or cloud computing, but these are either too expensive or too hard to configure. This paper proposes to scale up MSR analysis using ``general-purpose computing on graphics processing units'' (GPGPU) on off-the-shelf video cards. In a representative MSR case study to measure co-change on version history of the Eclipse project, we find that the GPU approach is up to a factor of 43.9 faster than a CPU-only approach."

These can be scaled at runtime to dynamically adjust their resources allocation to maintain consistent quality of service in response to changing working conditions, like flash crowds or periodic peaks. Providers need models to predict the system performances of different resource allocations to fully exploit dynamic application scaling. Traditional performance models such as linear models and queuing networks might be simplistic for real Cloud applications; moreover, they are not robust to change. We propose a performance modelling approach that is practical for highly variable elastic applications in the Cloud and automatically adapts to changing working conditions. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for the synthesis of a self-adaptive controller."

The main findings of this survey are the following. (1) SOA is a relevant phenomenon in Italy, (2) Web services and RESTFul services are well-known/used and (3) orchestration languages and UDDI are little known and used. These results suggest that in Italy SOA is interpreted in a more simplistic way with respect to the current/real definition (i.e., without the concepts of orchestration/choreography and registry). Currently, the adoption of SOA is medium/low with a stable/positive trend of pervasiveness."

And yet, automatic bug finding tools cannot find metadata-related bugs introduced during program refactoring and enhancement. To address this shortcoming, we have created metadata invariants, a new programming abstraction that expresses naming and typing relationships between metadata and the main source code of a program. A paper that appears in the main technical program of ICSE 2012 describes the idea, concept, and prototype of metadata invariants. The goal of this demo is to supplement that paper with a demonstration of our Eclipse plugin, Metadata Bug Finder (MBF). MBF takes as input a script written in our domain-specific language that describes a set of metadata coding conventions the programmer wishes to enforce. Then after each file save operation, MBF checks the edited codebase for the presence of any violations of the given metadata programming conventions. These violations are immediately reported to the programmer as potential metadata-related bugs. By making the programmer aware of these potential bugs, MBF prevents them from seeping into production, thereby improving the overall correctness of the edited codebase."

  "Abstract": "To understand and improve processes in organizations, six key questions need to be answered, namely, what, how, where, who, when, why. Organizations with established processes have IT system(s) that gather(s) information about some or all of the key questions. Software organizations usually have defined processes, but they usually lack information about how processes are actually executed. Moreover, there is no explicit information about process instances and activities. Existing process mining techniques face problems in coping with such environment. We propose a tool, Egidio, which uses non-invasively collected data and builds organizational models. In particular, we explain the tool within a software company, which is able to extract different aspects of development processes. The main contribution of Egidio is the ability to mine processes and organizational models from fine-grained data collected in a non-invasive manner, without interrupting the developers’ work."

  "Abstract": "While working in an IDE, developers typically deal with a large number of different artifacts at the same time. The software development process requires that they repeatedly switch between different artifacts, which often depends on searching for these artifacts in the source code structure. We propose a tool that integrates context-based search and recommendation of source code artifacts in Eclipse. The artifacts are collected from the workspace of the developer and represented using ontologies. A context model of the developer is used to improve search and give recommendations of these artifacts, which are ranked according to their relevance to the developer. The tool was tested by a group of developers and the results show that contextual information has an important role in retrieving relevant information for developers."

To improve the efficiency of the whole process, we propose a bug processing framework that integrates bug report analysis and fault localization. An instance of the framework is implemented for regression faults. Preliminary results on a large open source application demonstrate both efficiency and effectiveness."

  "Abstract": "In the software life cycle the internal structure of the system undergoes continuous modifications. These changes push away the source code from its original design, often reducing its quality. In such cases refactoring techniques can be applied to improve the design quality of the system. Approaches existing in literature mainly exploit structural relationships present in the source code, e.g., method calls, to support the software engineer in identifying refactoring solutions. However, also semantic information is embedded in the source code by the developers, e.g., the terms used in the comments. This research investigates about the usefulness of combining structural and semantic information to support software refactoring."

  "Abstract": "Service-Oriented product lines (SOPLs) are dynamic software product lines, in which, the products are developed based on services and service-oriented architecture. Although there are similarities between components and services, there are important differences so that we cannot use component-based product line engineering methods and techniques for SOPL engineering. These differences emerge from the fact that, services can be discovered as black box elements from external repositories. Moreover, services can be dynamically bound and are business-aligned. Therefore, analyzing the conformance of discovered external services with the variability of services in the SOPL –which must be aligned to the variable business needs-is necessary. Variability must be managed, that is, it must be represented (modeled), used (instantiated and capable of conformance checking) and maintained (evolved) over time. Feature Models are insufficient for modeling variability in SOPL, because, services cannot be simply mapped to one or more features, and identification of the mapping depends on knowing the detailed implementation of the services. This research aims at providing an approach to managing the variability in SOPLs so that external services can be involved in the SOPL engineering. This paper presents an overview of the proposal."

  "Abstract": "Textual specification documents do not represent a suitable starting point for software development. This issue is due to the inherent problems of natural language such as ambiguity, impreciseness and incompleteness. In order to overcome these shortcomings, experts derive analysis models such as requirements models. However, these models are difficult and costly to create manually. Furthermore, the level of abstraction of the models is too low, thus hindering the automated transformation process. We propose a novel approach which uses high abstraction requirements models in the form of Object System Models (OSMs) as targets for the transformation of natural language specifications in conjunction with appropriate text mining and machine learning techniques. OSMs allow the interpretation of the textual specification based on a small set of facts and provide structural and behavioral information. This approach will allow both (1) the enhancement of minimal specifications, and in the case of comprehensive specifications (2) the determination of the most suitable structure of reusable requirements."

To guarantee high quality of web applications in terms of security, we propose a structured approach, inspired by software testing. In this paper we present our research plan and ongoing work to use security testing to address problems of potentially attackable code. Static analysis is used to reveal candidate vulnerabilities as a set of execution conditions that could lead to an attack. We then resort to automatic test case generation to obtain those input values that make the application execution satisfy such conditions. Eventually, we propose a security oracle to assess whether such test cases are instances of successful attacks."

As organisations start to federate access to their resources, authorization infrastructures become increasingly difficult to manage, to a point where relying only on human resources becomes unfeasible. In our work, we propose a Self-Adaptive Authorization Framework (SAAF) that is capable of monitoring the usage of resources, and controlling access to resources through the manipulation of authorization assets (e.g., authorization policies, access rights and sessions), due to the identification of abnormal usage. As part of this work, we explore the use of models for facilitating the autonomic management of federated authorization infrastructures by 1) classifying access behaviour exhibited by users, 2) modelling authorization assets, including usage, for identifying abnormal behaviour, and 3) managing authorization through the adaptation and reflection of modelled authorization assets. SAAF will be evaluated by integrating it into an existing authorization infrastructure that would allow the simulation of abnormal usage scenarios."

As an example, this paper proposes to use domain specific ontological relations during concept mapping and location activities when implementing business requirements."

However, obtaining a modular, extensible and reusable PLA is a people-intensive and non-trivial task, related to different and possible conflicting factors. Hence, the PLA design is a hard problem and to find the best architecture can be formulated as an optimization problem with many factors. Similar Software Engineering problems have been efficiently solved by search-based algorithms in the field known as Search-based Software Engineering. The existing approaches used to optimize software architecture are not suitable since they do not encompass specific characteristics of SPL. To easy the SPL development and to automate the PLA design this work introduces a multi-objective optimization approach to the PLA design. The approach is now being implemented by using evolutionary algorithms. Empirical studies will be performed to validate the neighborhood operators, SPL measures and search algorithms chosen. Finally, we intend to compare the results of the proposed approach with PLAs designed by human architects."

One of the most difficult and complex tasks in the debugging activity is software fault localization. A commonly-used method to fix software fault is computing suspiciousness of program elements according to failed test executions and passed test executions. However, this technique does not give full consideration to dependences between program elements, thus its capacity for efficient fault localization is limited. Our research intends to introduce program slicing technique and statistical method which extracts dependencies between program elements and refines execution history, then builds program slicing spectra to rank suspicious elements by a statistical metric. We expect that our method will contribute directly to the improvement of the effectiveness and the accuracy of software fault localization and reduce the software development and maintenance effort and cost."

Literature performs task allocation between distributed sites on limited criteria irrespective of the communication and coordination needs of the people. Conway’s law relates product architecture with the communication and coordination needs of the people. Product architecture consists of multiple views based on different perspectives. Task allocation needs information about different architectural views and their interrelationships. Task allocation is also dependent on other factors not depicted in product architecture such as temporal, knowledge and cultural dependencies between distributed sites mentioned as external factors in the research. A well-conceived task allocation strategy will reduce communication and coordination dependency between sites/teams resulting in reduced time delay and smooth distributed development. The research aims to develop and validate a task allocation strategy based on information of system architecture for distributed environment. The strategy would consider all important factors during task allocation resulting in reduced communication and coordination overhead and time delay."

The main target of our research is to develop strategies for the automatic evolution of a test suite that does inspire confidence. When the program is changed, test cases shall be augmented that witness changed output for the same input (test suite augmentation). If two test cases witness the same partition, one is to be discarded (test suite reduction)."

The goal is to increase the performance awareness of developers by providing feedback with respect to performance properties that is integrated in the every day development process. The feedback is based on domain-specific prediction functions derived by a generic methodology that executes a series of systematic measurements. We apply and validate the approach in different development scenarios at SAP."

During my PhD I am considering a significant and consistent set of UML diagrams, where timed-related properties can be modeled carefully, and I am ascribing them with a formal semantics based on metric temporal logic. The use of logic is aimed to help capture the composite semantics of the different views efficiently. The result is then used to feed a bounded model/satisfiability checker to allow users to verify these systems, even from the initial phases of the design. The final goal is to realize an advanced modeling framework where users can exploit both a well-known modeling notation and advanced verification capabilities seamlessly."

However, developers are not always aware of these Coordination Requirements. Current methods which detect the need to coordinate rely on information which is available only after development work has been completed. This does not enable developers to act on their coordination needs. Furthermore, even if developers were aware of all Coordination Requirements, they likely would be overwhelmed by the large number and would not be able to effectively follow up directly with the developers involved in each dependent task. I will investigate a more timely method to determine Coordination Requirements in a software development team as they emerge and how to focus the developers’ attention on the most crucial ones. Further, I hope to prove that direct inter-personal communication is not always necessary to fulfill these requirements and gain insight on how we can develop tools that encourage cheaper forms of coordination."

Artificial diversity is an effective defense against many types of attack, and one form, address-space randomization, has been widely applied. Present artificial diversity implementations are either coarse-grained or require source code. Because of the widespread use of software of unknown provenance, e.g., libraries, where no source code is provided or available, building diversity into the source code is not always possible. I investigate an approach to stack layout transformation that operates on x86 binary programs, which would allow users to obfuscate vulnerabilities and increase their confidence in the software’s dependability. The proposed approach is speculative. the stack frame layout for a function is inferred from the binary and assessed by executing the transformed program. Upon assessment failure, the inferred layout is refined in hopes to better reflect the actual function layout."

In this thesis we aim to provide techniques that overcome such limitations, e.g. supporting more expressive goal specifications, distinguishing controllable from monitorable actions or guaranteeing achievement of the desired goals, among others. Hence, improving the state of the art in the synthesis of event-based controllers. Moreover, we plan to provide efficient tools supporting the developed techniques and evaluate them by modelling known case studies from the software engineering literature. Ultimately, showing that by allowing more expressiveness of controller goals and domain model specifications, and explicitly distinguishing controllable and monitorable actions such case studies can be more accurately modelled and solutions guaranteeing satisfaction of the goals can be achieved."

We propose the use of biological methods to group artefacts, to detect co-evolution among them, and to construct their phylogenic trees to express their evolution trends. First, we introduced the novel concepts of macro co-changes (MCCs), i.e., of artefacts that co-change within a large time interval and of dephase macro co-changes (DMCCs), i.e., macro co-changes that always happen with the same shifts in time. We developped an approach, Macocha, to identify these new patterns of artefacts co-evolution in large programs. Now, we are analysing the evolution of classes playing roles in design pattern and–or anti-patterns. In parallel to previous work, we are detecting what classes are in macro co-change or in dephase macro co-change with the design motifs. Results trend to show that classes plying roles in design motifs have specifics evolution trends. Finally, we are implementing an approach, Profilo, to achieve the analysis of the evolution of artefacts and versions of large object-oriented programs. Profilo create a phylogenic tree of different versions of program that describes versions evolution and the relation among versions and programs. We will also evaluate the usefulness of our tools using lab and field studies."

But clever technical solutions to those challenges may impose additional societal costs, e.g., by consuming substantial resources at odds with Green Computing, another major area of societal concern. We propose a new crosscutting research area, Societal Computing, that focuses on the technical tradeoffs among computational models and application domains that raise significant societal issues. This dissertation, advised by Prof. Gail Kaiser, will focus on privacy concerns in the context of Societal Computing and will aim to address research topics such as design patterns and architectures for privacy tradeoffs, better understanding of users' privacy requirements so that tradeoffs with other areas such as green computing can be dealt with in a more effective manner, and better visualization techniques for making privacy and its tradeoffs more understandable."

  "Authors": ["Kathryn T. Stolee"],

  "Abstract": "Finding suitable code for reuse is a common task for programmers. Two general approaches dominate the code search literature. syntactic and semantic. While queries for syntactic search are easy to compose, the results are often vague or irrelevant. On the other hand, a semantic search may return relevant results, but current techniques require developers to write specifications by hand, are costly as potentially matching code need to be executed to verify congruence with the specifications, or only return exact matches. In this work, we propose an approach for semantic search in which programmers specify lightweight, incomplete specifications and an SMT solver automatically identifies programs from a repository, encoded as constraints, that match the specifications. The repository of programs is automatically encoded offline so the search for matching programs is efficient. The program encodings cover various levels of abstraction to enable partial matches when no or few exact matches exists. We instantiate this approach on a subset of the Yahoo! Pipes mashup language, and plan to extend our techniques to more traditional programming languages as the research progresses."

Models are considered as the key artifacts and as a result the success of the whole software development process relies on these models and their quality. Consequently, there is an urgent need for adequate methods to ensure high quality of models. Model execution can serve as the crucial basis for such methods by enabling to automatically test and debug models. Therefore, lessons learned from testing and debugging of code may serve as a valuable source of inspiration. However, the peculiarities of models in comparison to code, such as multiple views and different abstraction levels, impede the direct adoption of existing methods for models. Thus, we claim that the currently available tool support for model testing and debugging is still insufficient because these peculiarities are not adequately addressed. In this work, we aim at tackling these shortcomings by proposing a novel model execution environment based on fUML, which enables to efficiently test and debug UML models."

Software developers rarely divulge development knowledge about the software to operators, while operators rarely communicate field knowledge to developers. To improve the quality and reduce the operational cost of large-scale software systems, bridging the gap between these two worlds is essential. This thesis proposes the use of logs as mechanism to bridge the gap between these two worlds. Logs are messages generated from statements inserted by developers in the source code and are often used by operators for monitoring the field operation of a system. However, the rich knowledge in logs has not yet been fully used because of their non-structured nature, their large scale, and the use of the ad hoc log analysis techniques. Through case studies on large commercial and open source systems, we plan to demonstrate the value of logs as a tool to support developers and operators."

Due to the complexity of this dependence, a unifying framework must be defined and for this purpose we adopt the complex networks methodology. We use a data-driven approach based on a large collection of open source software projects extracted from online project development platforms. The preliminary results presented in this article reveal that the network perspective yields key insights into the sustainability of software development."

  "Abstract": "Users prefer using multiple mobile devices interchangeably by switching between the devices. A solution to this requirement is the migration of applications between mobile devices at runtime. In our vision to move the application from a device A to a device B, instead of synchronizing just the application's data, a simple swiping gesture can be used. Afterwards the user is able to use the same application including its current state on device B. To achieve this, we plan to put the running application on the device A into a paused state, take a snapshot afterwards, move the application to the device B by using a middleware on both devices, extract the snapshot on device B and finally resume it on device B from its paused state. The outcome of the research will be a framework and either a kernel module or an API to migrate mobile applications."

However, developers are not always aware of these Coordination Requirements. Current methods which detect the need to coordinate rely on information which is available only after development work has been completed. This does not enable developers to act on their coordination needs. I have investigated a more timely method to determine Coordination Requirements in a software development team as they emerge."

USC’s fifth-generation wiki-based win-win negotiation support tool [1] was not as successful in improving over the previous four generations [2] as hoped - it encountered problems with non-technical stakeholder usage. The popularity of Facebook and Gmail ushered in a new era of widely-used social networking capabilities that I have been using to develop and experiment with a new way for collaborative requirements elicitation and management – marrying the way people collaborate on Facebook and organize their emails on Gmail to come up with a social networking-like platform to help achieve better usage of the WinWin negotiation framework [4]. Initial usage results on 14 small projects involving non-technical stakeholders have shown profound implications on the way requirements are negotiated and used, through the system and software definition and development processes. Subsequently, Winbook has also been adopted as a part of a project to bridge requirements and architecting for a major US government organization. \\n\\nKeywords – collaborative requirements elicitation; WinWin negotiations; social networking"

  "Abstract": "The technical debt (TD) metaphor describes a tradeoff between short-term and long-term goals in software development. Developers, in such situations, accept compromises in one dimension (e.g. maintainability) to meet an urgent demand in another dimension (e.g. delivering a release on time). Since TD produces interests in terms of time spent to correct the code and accomplish quality goals, accumulation of TD in software systems is dangerous because it could lead to more difficult and expensive maintenance. The research presented in this paper is focused on the usage of automatic static analysis to identify Technical Debt at code level with respect to different quality dimensions. The methodological approach is that of Empirical Software Engineering and both past and current achieved results are presented, focusing on functionality, efficiency and maintainability."

  "Abstract": "Spreadsheets are increasingly used as programming languages, in the construction of large and complex systems. The fact is that spreadsheets, being a highly flexible framework, lack important programming language features such as abstraction or encapsulation. This flexibility, however, comes with a price. spreadsheets are populated with significant amounts of errors. One of the approaches that try to overcome this problem advocates the use of model-driven spreadsheet development. a spreadsheet model is defined, from which a concrete spreadsheet is generated. Although this approach has been proved effective in other contexts, still it needs to accommodate for future evolution of both the model and its instance, so that they remain synchronized at all moments. In this paper, we propose a pair of transformation sets, one working at the model level and the other at the instance level, such that each transformation in one set is related to a transformation in the other set. With our approach, we ensure model/data compliance while allowing for model and data evolution."

  "Authors": ["Andreas Demuth"],
  "Affiliations": ["JKU Linz, Austria"],
  "Abstract": "Metamodels are commonly used in Model-Driven Engineering to define available model elements and structures. However, metamodels are likely to change during development for various reasons like requirement changes or evolving domain knowledge. Updating a metamodel typically leads to non-conformance issues with existing models. Hence, evolution strategies must be developed. Additionally, the tool implementation must also be updated to support the evolved metamodel. We propose the use of metamodel-independent tools with unified modeling concepts for working with all kinds of metamodels and models. By applying the Constraint-Driven Modeling approach and generating model constraints from metamodels automatically, we solve the described issues and enable dynamic, evolving metamodels. A prototype implementation has shown the feasibility of the approach and performance tests suggest that it also scales with increasing model sizes."

We aim to assist less skilled developers in composing own mashups by interactively recommending composition knowledge in the form of modeling patterns and fostering knowledge reuse. Our prototype system demonstrates our idea of interactive recommendation and automated pattern weaving, which involves recommending relevant composition patterns to the users during development, and once selected, applying automatically the changes as suggested in the selected pattern to the mashup model under development. The experimental evaluation of our prototype implementation demonstrates that even complex composition patterns can be efficiently stored, queried and weaved into the model under development in browser-based mashup tools."

As code snippets continue to evolve both on the side of the user and on the side of the author, both may wish to benefit from remote bug fixes or refinements --- authors may be interested in the actual usage of their code snippets, and researchers could gather information on clone usage. We propose to maintain a link between software clones across repositories and outline how the links can be created and maintained."

To this end, we developed IDE++ on top of Eclipse IDE. For evaluation, we built applications upon the framework to illustrate 1) the need for capturing comprehensive, finegrained IDE interactions, and 2) IDE++’s ease of use. We believe that IDE++ is a step toward building next generation, customizable and intelligent IDEs."

  "Abstract": "Complexity is now one of the major challenges for the IT industry. Systems might become too complex to be managed by humans and, thus, will have to be self-managed. Self-configure themselves for operation, self-protect from attacks, self-heal from errors and self-tune for optimal performance. (Self-)Adaptive systems evaluate their own behavior and change it when the evaluation indicates that it is not accomplishing the software's purpose or when better functionality and performance are possible. \\n\\nTo that end, we need to monitor the behavior of the running system and compare it to an explicit formulation of requirements and domain assumptions. Feedback loops (e.g., the MAPE loop) constitute an architectural solution for this and, as proposed by past research, should be a first class citizen in the design of such systems. We advocate that adaptive systems should be designed this way from as early as Requirements Engineering and that reasoning over requirements is fundamental for run-time adaptation. \\n\\nWe therefore propose an approach for the design of adaptive systems based on requirements and inspired in control theory. Our proposal is goal-oriented and targets software-intensive socio-technical systems, in an attempt to integrate control-loop approaches with decentralized agents inspired approaches. Our final objective is a set of extensions to state-of-the-art goal-oriented modeling languages that allow practitioners to clearly specify the requirements of adaptive systems and a run-time framework that helps developers implement such requirements."

In this paper, we present the SeCold project, which is the first online, publicly available software ecosystem Linked Data dataset. As part of this research, not only theoretical background on how to publish such datasets is provided, but also the actual dataset. SeCold contains about two billion facts, such as source code statements, software licenses, and code clones from over 18.000 software projects.

Our technique is modular, it exercises (stateful) protocol implementations in depth, and handles encrypted traffic. We use a concrete implementation of the protocol to generate valid inputs, and mutate the inputs using a set of fuzz operators. A dynamic memory analysis tool monitors the execution as an oracle to detect the vulnerabilities exposed by fuzz-testing. We provide the fuzzer with the necessary keys and cryptographic algorithms in order to properly mutate encrypted messages. We present a case study on two widely used, mature implementations of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol and report on two new vulnerabilities discovered by our fuzz-testing tool. We also compare the effectiveness of our technique to two existing model-based fuzz-testing tools for IKE."

Thus exploiting the PolPA policy specification, we present a fault model and a test strategy able to highlight the problems, vulnerabilities and faults that could occur during the PDP implementation, and a testing framework for the automatic generation of a test suite that covers the fault model. Preliminary results of the test framework application to a realistic case study are presented."

We rely on existing test cases to collect HTML pages in safe conditions, i.e. when no attack is run. Pages are then used to construct the safe model of the application under analysis, a model that describes the structure of an application response page for safe input values. The oracle eventually detects a successful attack when a test makes the application display a web page that is not compliant with the safe model."

  "Abstract": "By changing the way software is delivered to end users, markets for mobile apps create a false sense of security. apps are downloaded from a market that can potentially be regulated. In practice, this is far from truth and instead, there has been evidence that security is not one of the primary design tenets for the mobile app stores. Recent studies have indicated mobile markets are harboring apps that are either malicious or vulnerable leading to compromises of millions of devices. The key technical obstacle for the organizations overseeing these markets is the lack of practical and automated mechanisms to assess the security of mobile apps, given that thousands of apps are added and updated on a daily basis. In this paper, we provide an overview of a multi-faceted project targeted at automatically testing the security and robustness of Android apps in a scalable manner. We describe an Android-specific program analysis technique capable of generating a large number of test cases for fuzzing an app, as well as a test bed that given the generated test cases, executes them in parallel on numerous emulated Androids running on the cloud."

  "Abstract": "There is a documented gap between academic and practitioner views on software testing. This paper tries to close the gap by investigating both views regarding the benefits and limits of test automation. The academic views are studied with a systematic literature review while the practitioners views are assessed with a survey, where we received responses from 115 software professionals. The results of the systematic literature review show that the source of evidence regarding benefits and limitations is quite shallow as only 25 papers provide the evidence. Furthermore, it was found that benefits often originated from stronger sources of evidence (experiments and case studies), while limitations often originated from experience reports. We believe that this is caused by publication bias of positive results. The survey showed that benefits of test automation were related to test reusability, repeatability, test coverage and effort saved in test executions. The limitations were high initial invests in automation setup, tool selection and training. Additionally, 45% of the respondents agreed that available tools in the market offer a poor fit for their needs. Finally, it was found that 80% of the practitioners disagreed with the vision that automated testing would fully replace manual testing."

When applied to large-scale programs, its scalability however is limited due to the combinatorial explosion of the path space and the high cost of computation. Several sophisticated search strategies have been proposed to better guide dynamic symbolic execution towards achieving high code coverage. While confirmed effective, these techniques may deteriorate in practical situations because of the large computation cost involved. In this paper, we propose a search heuristic which is directed by coverage information and interleaved with random search to perform dynamic symbolic execution for coverage improvements and cost-effectiveness. We conducted two evaluations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and to study the impact of computation costs on its practical capabilities."

An executable EFSM model is used to provide run-time feedback information as fitness function. And then scatter search algorithm is used to search for test data that can trigger given transition paths. Based on the executable model, the expected outputs associated with test data are also collected for construction of test oracles automatically. Finally, test data (inputs) and test oracles (expected outputs) are combined to be test cases. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively generate test cases to exercise the feasible transition paths."

  "Abstract": "Test cases are often similar. A preliminary study of eight open-source projects found that on average at least 8 % of all test cases are clones; the maximum found was 42 %. The clones are not identical with their originals - identifiers of classes, methods, attributes and sometimes even order of statements and assertions differ. But the test cases reuse testing logic and are needed for testing. They serve a purpose and cannot be eliminated. We present an approach that generates useful test clones automatically, thereby eliminating some of the 'grunt' work of testing. An important advantage over existing automated test case generators is that the clones include the test oracle. Hence, a human decision maker is often not needed to determine whether the output of a test is correct. The approach hinges on pairs of classes that provide analogous functionality, i.e., functions that are tested with the same logic. TestCloner transcribes tests involving analogous functions from one class to the other. Programmers merely need to indicate which methods are analogs. Automatic detection of analogs is currently under investigation. Preliminary results indicate a significant reduction in the number of 'boiler-plate' tests that need to be written by hand. The transcribed tests do detect defects and can provide hints about missing functionality."

  "Abstract": "Testing software with a GUI is difficult. Manual testing is costly and error-prone, but recorded test cases frequently ``break'' due to changes in the GUI. Test cases intended to test business logic must therefore be converted to a less ``brittle'' form to lengthen their useful lifespan. In this paper, we describe BlackHorse, an approach to doing this that converts a recorded test case to Java code that bypasses the GUI. The approach was implemented within the testing environment of Research In Motion. We describe the design of the toolset and discuss lessons learned during the course of the project."

One common approach is to have a domain expert instruct a QA developer to implement what she would do manually in the application. Though there exist record-replay tools specifically developed for this, these tend to scale poorly for more complicated test scenarios. \\n\\nWe present a different solution. An Embedded Domain Specific Language (EDSL) in F#, containing the means to model the user interface, and the various manipulations of it. We hope that this DSL will bridge the gap between the business domain and technical domain of applications to such a degree that domain experts may be able to construct automatic tests without depending on QA developers, and that these tests will prove more maintainable."

  "Abstract": "Information systems with sophisticated graphical user interfaces are still difficult to test and debug. As a detailed and reproducible report of test case execution is essential, we advocate the documentation of test case execution on several levels. We present an approach to video-based documentation of automated GUI testing that is linked to the test execution procedure. Viewing currently executed test case instructions alongside actual onscreen responses of the application under test facilitates understanding of the failure. This approach is tailored to the challenges of automated GUI testing and debugging with respect to technical and usability aspects. Screen recording is optimized for speed and memory consumption while all relevant details are captured. Additional browsing capabilities for easier debugging are introduced. Our concepts are evaluated by a working implementation, a series of performance measurements during a technical experiment, and industrial experience from 370 real-world test cases carried out in a large software company."

  "Abstract": "Smartphones are becoming increasingly popular among users. They are equipped with an enormous number of applications, and these applications drain the smartphones’ batteries. Moreover, battery capacity is significantly restricted due to constraints on size and weight of the device. It is important for smartphone applications to be energy efficient. Thus, a methodology to conduct energy performance testing is needed for two reasons. (i) evaluate the power consumption of a single application on a given device; (ii) compare the power consumption of different smartphones or platforms running the same application. In our earlier work \"Selection and execution of user level test cases for energy cost evaluation of smartphones\" (Proceedings of the 6th AST, 2011), we have developed a testing methodology that significantly reduces the number of test cases. In addition, we have introduced the concepts of primary and standalone test configurations. However, ordering of the executions of those two kinds of tests is non-trivial, and it was not studied in that paper. \\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce a methodology to interleave the identification of those two kinds of test configurations in order to reduce the total number of configurations. We express the methodology in the form of a detailed flow chart that application developers can easily follow. We apply the methodology to a specific smartphone, namely HTC Nexus One smartphone in order to illustrate the process of this methodology. We have shown that the total number of test configurations obtained by the given methodology is the same as the number predicted by numerical expressions."

Although seams are a valuable technique, it is hard and cumbersome to apply them without automated refactorings and tool chain configuration support. \\n\\nWe show how to create seams in C++ by using new refactorings. To automate this task, we provide sophisticated IDE support. Our reference implementation creates the boilerplate code and the necessary infrastructure for the four presented seam types object, compile, preprocessor and link seam."

  "Abstract": "Test suites often grow very large over many releases, such that it is impractical to re-execute all test cases within limited resources. Test case prioritization, which rearranges test cases, is a key technique to improve regression testing. Code coverage information has been widely used in test case prioritization. However, other important information, such as the ordered sequence of program elements measured by execution frequencies, was ignored by previous studies. It raises a risk to lose detections of difficult-to-find bugs. Therefore, this paper improves the similarity-based test case prioritization using the ordered sequence of program elements measured by execution counts. The empirical results show that our new technique can increase the rate of fault detection more significantly than the coverage-based ART technique. Moreover, our technique can detect bugs in loops more quickly and be more cost-benefits than the traditional ones."

  "Abstract": "Since controller applications must typically satisfy real-time constraints while manipulating real-world variables, their implementation often results in programs that run ex- tremely fast and manipulate numerical inputs and outputs. These characteristics make them particularly suitable for test case generation. In fact a number of test cases can be easily created, due to the simplicity of numerical inputs, and executed, due to the speed of computations. In this paper we present G-RankTest, a technique for test case generation and prioritization. The key idea is that test case generation can run for long sessions (e.g., days) to accurately sample the behavior of a controller application and then the generated test cases can be prioritized according to different strategies, and used for regression testing every time the application is modified. In this work we investigate the feasibility of using the gradient of the output as a criterion for selecting the test cases that activate the most tricky behaviors, which we expect easier to break when a change occurs, and thus deserve priority in regression testing."

All-values symbolic execution focuses on enumerating the (symbolic) values that may derive from the symbolic execution of program statements. It exploits program dependencies to optimize the symbolic execution of those statements that can be executed with the same symbolic inputs on multiple (up to infinite) paths. Although a fully working implementation and a thorough evaluation are yet to come, this paper illustrates with simple, but representative examples that the proposed technique can boost the efficiency of symbolic execution, and suite interesting new applications."

Results of an empirical study conducted over four programs from the SIR benchmark show how the proposed technique (i) obtains non-dominated solutions having a higher diversity than the previously proposed multi-objective Pareto genetic algorithms; and (ii) improves the convergence speed of the genetic algorithms."

  "Abstract": "A review of the literature showed that the probability of system success, i.e. user acceptance, system quality and system usage, can be increased by user-developer communication. So far most research on user participation focuses either on early or on late development phases. Especially large IT projects require increased participation, due to their high complexity. We believe that the step in software development when user requirements are translated (and thus interpreted) by developers into a technical specification (i.e. system requirements, architecture and models) is a critical one for user participation. In this step a lot of implicit decisions are taken, some of which should be communicated to the end users. Therefore, we want to create a method that enhances communication between users and developers during that step. We identified trigger points (i.e. changes on initial user requirements), and the granularity level on which to communicate with the end users. Also, representations of changes and adequate means of communication are discussed."

As a preliminary step we have developed a tool that extends a collaborative development environment by aggregating content from social networks and microblogs into the developer’s workspace."

During the life cycle of software, there is communication, cooperation and collaboration (C3) between a wide range of diversified stakeholders ranging from management team to maintenance team. We believe that the lack of emphasis on improving C3 is often the major cause for software failures. In this paper, we summarize four and half years of our experience of a analyzing a decade-long instructional software for adult literacy developed by 9 different teams spread across 9 different locations following 9 varied processes. We present the different kinds of stakeholders that we came across during this analysis and present the challenges of C3 in that context. We then present the initial facets of our solution from three major dimensions (i) designing a unifying modeling language for improving stakeholder C3 (ii) modeling information for multiple stakeholders using various modes of rendering at multiple levels of granularity (iii) harnessing the power of social networking to improve C3 among all stakeholders."

  "Abstract": "Software engineering is increasingly carried out in distributed settings. Software engineers are becoming more nomadic in carrying out their work, working from the customer location, the headquarters of their own company, their home, or sometimes even from their holiday locations. Technological support is needed to overcome the negative impacts of distance that are introduced by this trend. The central theme in this paper for supporting dislocated software engineers lies in increasing their awareness level to a level similar to (or even exceeding) what they experience in a co-located setting. In this paper we present the context in which we are bootstrapping a custom fit environment to support a team of fully dislocated software engineers and the incremental process we use. By working in this fashion we are discovering the requirements to support fully distributed teams while at the same time providing our setting with working solutions to help them with their day to day challenges. Finally, this continuous practical use also provides us with empirical data to validate the increase in awareness levels of dislocated software engineers and helps us in pinpointing important open research challenges."

  "Abstract": "Software development activities face several challenges when they take place in geographically distributed settings. These challenges are often related to communication, collaboration and, especially, information diffusion among team members. This is especially important in impact analysis activities where all stakeholders need to align their work to understand the impact of a change. To properly support this, it is necessary to understand the different ways in which impact analysis activities are performed. In our previous work we identified two views of impact analysis. an organizational and an individual view. The first view is important for managers to understand the impact of the changes in the activities of the team, whereas the second refers to the developers’ strategies to deal with the impact of changes in their daily work. This paper discusses these views and based on them describes a tool, called Wolf, to support impact analysis activities. Our tool, based on semi-automatically generated traceability links, provides different visualizations to support communication, collaboration and information diffusion among stakeholders thereby facilitating impact analysis activities in geographically distributed settings."

Analyzing received end-user feedback is a work-intensive task. Thus, problems and changes in end-users' needs reach responsible requirements engineers after a significant delay. Automatic techniques are required to support this tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether end-user feedback can be prioritized automatically by combining keyword-based information retrieval and descriptive statistics. Moreover, we show in an evaluation that the obtained results are reasonable."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Haifa, Israel"],
  "Abstract": "The use of agile methodologies in industry has increased significantly over the past decade, promoting the value of human-centric software development process. This growing use derives the need to adjust agile methodologies to bigger, more complex system development projects, where architecture plays a significant role. However, many believe that an essential conflict exists between the requirement of minimalism in agile methods and the need for well-defined and documented architecture in complex systems. This paper presents an exploratory study aimed at understanding the software architecture related activities as perceived by architects with and without experience in agile methodologies. The findings indicate that while architects practicing only plan-driven methodologies perceive architecture activities as being related only to the first phases of the development process, architects involved in agile projects perceive architecture activities to be related to most or all phases of the development lifecycle. The latter perceptions are consistent with suggestions expressed in the literature regarding architecture in general and in agile methodologies in particular. Based on these findings we suggest that agile methods not only lead architects to adjust their behavior to the agile philosophy, but also improve architects’ perceptions and practice of architecture in general."

  "Affiliations": ["Siemens, Germany"],
  "Abstract": "Teaching requirements engineering (RE) often focuses on teaching factual knowledge such as how to write requirements, how to model the architecture, where and in which format to store the retrieved data? This is however only one side of the coin, working together is all about relationship between humans. In his daily work, requirements engineers face many situations where efficient communication is needed. We expect our requirements engineer to master the situations \"right\", expect him to act professionally. Looking at the situation for professional trainings for requirements engineers however, we often do not find a sound forum to train them. The training of these human factors or soft skills as we call them, is split up from the factual knowledge such as requirements engineering methods. To our knowledge, no approach exists, to combine the training of soft skills and factual RE knowledge into one training concept. This paper describes a workshop format which overcomes this situation and combines soft skills and factual RE knowledge into one training. We introduce the so-called REIM (Requirements Engineering and Improvisation) format. REIM utilizes a typical session of an improvisation theater course and extends it to the area of RE by using storytelling methods. This paper explains the main principle and elements of the workshop and provides an example for illustration. We conclude with lessons learned from already conducted workshops and outline next steps needed to validate the workshop’s efficiency in a proper case study."

  "Abstract": "Most suppliers in the automotive industry are facing the challenge of implementing Automotive SPICE, a domain-specific model of ISO/IEC 15504, which was first published in 2005. Original equipment manufacturers have increasingly requested SPICE certifications from their suppliers in order to effectively evaluate the development processes and identify reliable partners. To support organizations in their software process improvement effort, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) developed the IDEAL model. This guide is, however, influenced by the SEI’s work on CMM and based on the experiences with very large organizations. The goal of this paper is to examine the suitability of the IDEAL model for the implementation of Automotive SPICE at a medium-sized R&amp;D department. Preliminary results from an action research study at a global systems engineering company are discussed. The data indicate that adjustments are especially needed with regard to the factors participation and communication. Also, informal networks between companies, early decision-making and usability are shown to play an important role and might be added to the model."

  "Abstract": "Ideally, usability evaluation would be part of every software development project. However, it is often overlooked due to cost and time constraints. Usability inspection methods were developed to cut cost and time compared to traditional usability evaluation. However, they still bring with them certain requirements such as having multiple designers involved in the evaluation. Inspection techniques have also been shown to be difficult to learn and teach. With software development projects becoming increasingly distributed, it is ever more difficult to have sufficient participants in a usability inspection and to collaboratively learn the techniques. Motivated by these problems, we developed a novel, prototype environment called INspect-World for distributed usability inspection techniques. INspect-World is built on top of the virtual world platform OpenSimulator. As we investigate usability inspections performed in this environment, we also address ideas of human-centered end-user development in mediated communication contexts."

However, like sentences whispered in a children’s telephone game, as an issue moves through a software development process, it may undergo many changes, making it difficult to ensure that the problem reported was actually fixed. To better understand how software teams preserve the integrity of user-reported issues, we observed a software team over a 6-month period, analyzing the trajectory of user requests through their software development processes. Our observations revealed several representations of issues, highlighting several points where information about an issue was lost or transformed. Although this information loss appeared to be unavoidable as an issue went through the resolution process, we found it was offset by a web of transactive memory distributed throughout the support and product teams. This memory was reinforced by asynchronous chat about recent and commonly reported issues, and shared notions of what issues should be considered severe or urgent."

  "Abstract": "There is a growing belief that understanding and addressing the human processes employed during software development is likely to provide substantially more value to industry than yet more recommendations for the implementation of various methods and tools. To this end, considerable research effort has been dedicated to studying human issues as represented in software artifacts, due to its relatively unobtrusive nature. We have followed this line of research and have conducted a preliminary study of team behaviors using data mining techniques and linguistic analysis. Our data source, the IBM Rational Jazz repository, was mined and data from three different project areas were extracted. Communications in these projects were then analyzed using the LIWC linguistic analysis tool. We found that although there are some variations in language use among teams working on project areas dedicated to different software outcomes, project type and the mix of (and number of) individuals involved did not affect team behaviors as evident in their communications. These assessments are initial conjectures, however; we plan further exploratory analysis to validate these results. We explain these findings and discuss their implications for software engineering practice."

In this paper we describe a study designed to elicit stories from software developers about problems they encounter in their daily work.

  "Abstract": "This paper describes a design study that explores how multi-touch devices can provide support for developers when carrying out modeling tasks in software development. We investigate how well a multi-touch augmented approach performs compared to a traditional approach and if this new approach can be integrated into existing software engineering processes. For that, we have implemented a fully-functional prototype, which is concerned with agreeing on a good object-oriented design through the course of a Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) modeling session. We describe how multi-touch technology helps with integrating CRC cards with larger design methodologies, without loosing their unique physical interaction aspect. We observed high-potential in augmenting such informal sessions in software engineering with novel user interfaces, such as those provided by multi-touch devices."

  "Abstract": "Research that studies software developers can have a larger impact when its results generalize to other contexts. However, it is often unclear if, how, and why such results generalize. In this position paper, we aim to motivate software engineering researchers to generalize their findings. To meet this aim, we firstly enumerate the dimensions in which software engineering generalizations are made, and secondly, propose several practical ways researchers can make their work more generalizable. In meeting our aim, we hope to help the software engineering research community maximize their impact outside of software engineering."

  "Abstract": "Benefiting from inter-organizational collaboration while remaining competitive are organizations’ target in software industry nowadays. However, little is known about competition awareness and collaboration processes and practices in software intensive organizations. This paper introduces the first step to understand the role and impact of competition on team collaboration in the context of inter-organizational software project. A case study was designed and initially performed. Initial findings revealed a set of propositions for future research. We found that collaboration initiates from technical coordination requirement and is influenced by technical, social and organizational factors. Meanwhile, competition comes from business strategy and competition awareness could negatively influence effectiveness of social-technical collaboration. Future works will focus on the mutual influence between competition and collaboration and role of global dispersion on this interaction."

This study extends the existing knowledge on applying pair programming in industrial settings by interviewing 31 developers from 4 different companies. We investigate how often developers practice pair programming as opposed to working by themselves, whether developers would prefer to use PP more often or less often, and which aspects hinder the use of pairing. We found that the majority of developers use PP only for 10% of their development time but would like to use it more often. Moreover, our results indicate that organisational issues can hinder the use of PP."

Although many collaborative tools have been developed, we have insufficient knowledge of how they are used in practice. In this paper, we review the recent empirical studies on collaboration tools for GSE. Then we theorize a conceptual framework that aims to explain how the unique contextual dimensions of GSE (e.g. culture diversity and adaptation, etc.) influence practitioners’ attitudes toward, and usage of, the tools. The conceptual framework will guide our future empirical studies, and it will be refined by the empirical evidence collected in these studies."

However, little is known about when and how the developers backtrack, and modern IDEs do not provide much assistance for backtracking. As a first step towards gathering baseline knowledge about backtracking and designing more robust backtracking assistance tools in modern IDEs, we conducted an exploratory study with 12 professional developers and a follow-up online survey. Our study revealed several barriers they faced while backtracking. Subjects often manually commented and uncommented code, and often had difficulty finding relevant parts to backtrack. Backtracking was reported to be needed by 3/4 of the developers at least 'sometimes'."

Despite the challenge, the need to teach undergrad and graduate students the skills to work in such environment is well-known in academia. The goal of this paper is two-folded. First, we identify what has been thought, by whom and to whom by conducting a literature review. This review aims to consolidate the body of knowledge on the topic in order to help professors and professionals interested in teaching the subject. For instance, we found that 19 courses have been reported involving 25 countries in total since 1997. Most of the courses involves graduate students as the main audience, and mainly discuss challenges in distributed development. Our second goal is to propose the creation of a collaborative repository to store and to report teaching experiences on the topic helping the development and strengthening of the Teaching Network community."

Course lectures and materials educate students about software engineering best practices and DSD. The students developed a project organized into a set of work assignments that could be distributed across groups. At the end they learned to communicate and collaborate with each other, and they also believed that the course was helpful to them, which justifies the low number of dropouts. Most of the students, but not all, successfully completed their projects."

To be authentic, involved stakeholders need to be affected by what students deliver. However, this is usually not the case. Trying to provide students authentic stakeholder interactions, we already specified two distinct settings suitable for recruiting real stakeholders by providing a benefit for them in return. However, scalability issues of these settings remained. \\n\\nIn this paper, we present two ideas to overcome this issue. By cooperating with software companies which are building a product line, we gain access to many diverse stakeholders. Further, we propose to rely on course alumni to supervise stakeholder interactions to increase the scalability by reducing the lecturers’ supervision effort. These ideas are explained using a currently running course setting in collaboration with a software start-up which builds a product line of sports club management applications."

  "Abstract": "Software Engineering (SE) projects that emphasize maintenance and evolution can emulate industrial challenges and prepare students for careers in the software industry. Designing maintenance-centric SE projects, however, is difficult because software code upon which these projects must be based is not readily available. Open Source Software (OSS) can alleviate this issue by offering a rich and varied volume of code. This rich diversity of OSS projects, however, presents the greatest hurdle in seamlessly selecting suitable projects for integration. To better understand the scope of this diversity, initially, we propose to manually select uniformly difficult projects of appropriate complexity. Ultimately, based on the experiences and insights acquired through the manual selection, we envision the development of a systematic methodology based on software metrics to ease the project selection process. Such a systematic methodology will pave the way for the adoption of the OSS-based approach at peer institutions, bringing us a step closer to injecting realism into SE projects."

Industry definitely needs a large number of software engineers with potential to be productive from day one. They are feeling impatient at the academic community for not being pragmatic. At the same time Academic community faces many challenges, which often make them thread a traditional path thus ignoring the industrial needs. We present some of these challenges from both the industrial and academic perspectives.

Formalism allows engineers to reason rigorously about the system in hand; structure allows them to understand its purposes and behaviours. In the constructive activity of system development structure must therefore take precedence. The central role of formalism is to check and verify -- or, where necessary, correct --the products of more informal modes of thought. \\n\\nIn this talk these ideas are explored in the context of an illustrative system. The large structure of the system functionality is discussed, together with the nature of the components of that structure. Informal criteria of functional simplicity are presented. The inescapable mismatch between an intelligible functional structure and implementable software architecture is exposed. The role of formalism in these concerns is suggested."

  "Authors": ["Antonio Filieri", "Carlo Ghezzi"],
  "Affiliations": ["Politecnico di Milano, Italy"],
  "Abstract": "We consider high-level models that specify system behaviors probabilistically and support the specification of cost attributes. Specifically, we focus on Discrete Time Markov Reward Models (D-MRMs), i.e. state machines where probabilities can be associated with transitions and rewards (costs) can be associated with states and transitions. Through probabilities we model assumptions on the behavior of environment in which an application is embedded. Rewards can instead model the cost assumptions involved in the system's operations. A system is designed to satisfy the requirements, under the given assumptions. Design-time assumptions, however, can turn out to be invalid at runtime, and therefore it is necessary to verify whether changes may lead to requirements violations. If they do, it is necessary to adapt the behavior in a self-healing manner to continue to satisfy the requirements. We have previously presented an approach to support efficient runtime probabilistic model checking of DTMCs for properties expressed in PCTL. In this paper we extend the approach to D-MRMs and reward properties. The benefits of the approach are justified both theoretically and empirically on significant test cases."

  "Abstract": "There is a big semantic gap between today's general purpose programming languages on the one hand and the input languages of formal verification tools on the other hand. This makes integrating formal analyses into the daily development practice artificially complex. In this paper we advocate that the use of language engineering techniques can substantially improve this situation along three dimensions. First, more abstract and thus more analyzable domain specific languages can be defined, avoiding the need for abstraction recovery from programs written in general purpose languages. Second, restrictions on the use of existing languages can be imposed and thereby more analyzable code can be obtained and analyses can be incrementally defined. Third, by expressing verification conditions and the verification results at the domain level, they are easier to define and the results of analyses are easier to interpret by end users. We exemplify our approach with three domain specific language fragments integrated into the C programming language, together with a set of analyses. completeness and consistency of decision tables, model-checking-based analyses for a dialect of state machines and consistency of feature models. The examples are based on the mbeddr stack, an extensible C language and IDE for embedded software development."

Especially however in order to be able to eschew explicit recursion entirely, even in the definition of new recursion patterns, it’s essential to identify and validate a minimal set of basic recursion patterns. The immediate plausibility of foldr is validated by its application to the implementation of functions and recursion patterns, and especially by an abstract characterization of the programming devices used in these applications used to overcome complementary information deficiencies in data and control."

A component's behavior can be effectively described using finite state automata-based formalisms (e.g., statecharts~\\cite{Harel87}). The basic formalism, labelled transition systems, describes the behavior of a component in terms of states and labeled transitions. The more advanced formalisms, such as modal transition systems and interface automata, extend LTS to incorporate additional information related to interface operation controllability-distinguishing between input, output, and internal actions-and the possible partiality of a component's specification-distinguishing between required and unknown (maybe) behaviors. Capturing the controllability and partiality aspects of a component's specification facilitates (1) checking interface compatibility, (2) checking whether one component can safely replace another component, and (3) checking whether one specification is a proper refinement of another specification. In this paper, we study the existing definitions of these three types of checks, and then exemplify their limitations in the context of modal interface automata (MIA); MIA is a class of component behavior specifications that incorporates both controllability and partiality information. We outline a set of enhancements to MIA as possible solutions to the identified limitations."

  "Abstract": "We present a case study that illustrates the power of active learning for enabling the automated quality assurance of complex and distributed evolving systems. We illustrate how the development of the OCS, Springer Verlag's Online Conference System, is supported by continuous learning-based testing, that by its nature maintains the synchrony of the running application and the learned (test) model. The evolution of the test model clearly indicates which portions of the system remain stable and which are altered. Thus our approach includes classical regression testing and feature interaction detection. We show concretely how model checking, automata learning, and quantitative analysis concur with the holistic quality assurance of this product."

  "Abstract": "The increasing popularity of MDE results in the creation of larger models and model transformations, hence converting the specification of MDE artefacts in an error-prone task. Therefore, mechanisms to ensure quality and absence of errors in models are needed to assure the reliability of the MDE-based development process. Formal methods have proven their worth in the verification of software and hardware systems. However, the adoption of formal methods as a valid alternative to ensure model correctness is compromised for the inner complexity of the problem. To circumvent this complexity, it is common to impose limitations such as reducing the type of constructs that can appear in the model, or turning the verification process from automatic into user assisted. Since we consider these limitations to be counterproductive for the adoption of formal methods, in this paper we present EMFtoCSP, a new tool for the fully automatic, decidable and expressive verification of EMF models that uses constraint logic programming as the underlying formalism."

Analysis of their real-time behaviour is usually conducted at the implementation level. However, it is desirable to obtain an evaluation of real-time properties early at the development cycle, i.e., at the modelling stage. In this paper we present an approach to augmenting Event-B modelling with verification of real-time properties in Uppaal. We show how to extract a process-based view from an Event-B model that together with introducing time constraints allows us to obtain a timed automata model – an input model of Uppaal. We illustrate the approach by development and verification of the data processing software of the BepiColombo Mission."

Class projects which frequently complement lectures are limited by academic settings in various ways too. Simulation and digital game-based learning are considered to have great potential to extend the learning experiences beyond lectures and class projects, help to develop insight into the necessity of software processes and to widen the perspective of software engineering students in a virtual and efficient way. Several efforts made by different research groups show encouraging results. This research gathers preliminary findings, develops new ideas and gives suggestions to exhaust the potential further and to encourage the wider application of digital game-based learning in software engineering education. These suggestions are the foundation for building blocks of a new framework for simulation based digital learning games aiming to teach software engineering processes more effectively and efficiently."

These devices are usually equipped with specialized hardware to sense and interact with the environment. In this context the use of self-organizing techniques has been widely used to provide adaptation capabilities at the low level, such as for optimizing energy consumption, or for providing some fault-tolerance properties to the communication middleware. What we want to show in this work is how the same self-organization principles can be used at the user-experience level of context-aware applications. The approach we propose shows that self-organization can be used to model the introduction of gaming elements to motivate and simplify the use of context-aware applications, thus leading to higher quality software. This work is finally validated using a case study and empirical evidence from existing popular context-aware applications."

In this paper we address this problem by designing a distributed software architecture exploiting intuitive and non-invasive off-the-shelf technology typically used for videogame consoles. Adopting a remotely controlled serious game for in-home rehabilitation activities is more engaging for the elder and may also provide easily tunable parameters to better adapt the game therapy to the actual patient recovery. The proposed solution, thanks to its user-friendly interfaces and smooth learning curve, will also contribute in minimizing the interferences in the elder’s private life."

  "Abstract": "Learning is a process that is associated with a lot of effort and perseverance. In learning theories, motivation can be observed as a key factor. In some cases learning can become playing if the learning experience is so intrinsically satisfying and rewarding that external pressures or rewards for learning are of secondary importance. Serious games are able to increase motivation for learning by realizing diverse approaches which can address cognitive as well as affective learning. By using a variety of elements such as visual environments, story-lines, challenges, and interactions with non-player characters, serious games can be optimal learning environments. Even though, they have such motivational power, several studies have shown that there are no known forms of education as effective as a professional human tutor. This paper explores the interaction of human tutors with learners in a serious games with the focus on ’Social Development Theory’. It will present results that show how human tutors observe players in executing learning tasks, and interacting with the game environment in serious games. Based on the results of this studies we provide a definition of adaptivity for serious games."

How can we design and evaluate software that becomes a medium to engage and inform the user? We have gathered empirical data during a two days exhibition of two versions of a pervasive art installation by. observations, questionnaires, and input logs. Data analysis reveals that the art installation engaged users, with focus on young children, and communicated the intended message. The results are organized according to five important factors for developing and evaluating interacting art installations. These are. 1) data collection method; 2) user interaction; 3) social interaction; 4) issues about children; 5) message comprehension. We suggest that these factors can inform engineering practices for engaging software like video-games."

Our project is the creation of a three-part digital layer to increase museum engagement for all visitors, but particularly those considered digital natives. We have created two systems to be implemented in the museum, one to appeal to traditional visitors and one to better engage large groups of students. In the future, these two systems will be tied to an online meta-game to complete our digital layer by bringing the enhanced museum experience home for visitors."

In this work, we take a modular Statechart-based game AI modelling approach and develop a reuse strategy to enable fast development of new AIs. This is aided through the creation of a standardized interface for Statechart modules in a layered architecture. Reuse is enabled at a high-level through functional groups that encapsulate behaviour. \\n\\nThese concepts are solidified with the development of the SkyAI tool. SkyAI enables a developer to build and work with a library of modular components to develop new AIs by composing modules, and then output the resulting product to an existing game. Efficacy is demonstrated by reusing AI components from a tank to quickly make a much different AI for a simple animal."

The earlier these issues are identified, the less effort is required fixing them. But game assets like graphics are often expensive and are available later on, or even after game functionality has been implemented. Game prototypes are in this case created using lower fidelity visuals. While this technique makes it possible to perform usability tests, it may bias the feedback provided by usability testers. In this paper we investigate how the fidelity of the prototypes used for usability testing influence the feedback provided by testers."

The approach achieves this using estimation techniques based on program analysis of the mobile application. In evaluation, eCalc is able to estimate energy consumption within 9.5% of the ground truth for a set of mobile applications. Additionally, eCalc provides useful and meaningful feedback to the developer that helps to characterize energy consumption of the application."

  "Abstract": "An emerging trend for future software systems is self-optimization, especially w.r.t. energy efficiency. Models of soft- and hardware components at runtime, expressing current and alternative system configurations, are exploited to improve service utility as well as to decrease energy consumption. In recent work we showed how quality contracts---expressing dependencies between software and hardware components---can be used for energy auto-tuning. Notably, the declared provisions and requirements of individual components depend on software containers (i.e., the servers, components are deployed on) and thus, cannot be declared completely at design time. In this paper we present a semi-automated contract creation process that combines manual created contract templates with benchmarking and mathematical approximations for non-functional properties depending on the components' runtime behavior as well as their service's input parameters. We identify individual process activities and show how the process can be applied to approximate the non-functional behavior of software components providing simple sorting functionality."

A fundamental issue in the mobile application platform is to make deployment decision for individual tasks when the battery life of the mobile device is a major concern for the mobile user's experience. We propose a deployment scheme to offload expensive computational tasks from thin, mobile devices to powered, powerful devices on the cloud so that we could prolong battery life for mobile devices, meanwhile provide rich user experiences for such mobile applications. We envision that the scheme can be extended to other type of smart devices such as smart printers, smart TVs or sensors where offloading tasks is required to trade-off between performance and battery life."

In this domain, most of state-of-the-art solutions offer limited or constraining approaches to monitor the energy consumption of a device or a process. In this paper, we therefore report on a runtime energy monitoring framework we developed to easily report on the energy consumption of system processes. Concretely, our approach adopts an OS-level library, called PowerAPI, which estimates the power consumption of processes according to different dimensions (CPU, network, etc.). In order to better understand potential energy leaks of legacy software, we use this library to study the impact of programming languages and algorithmic choices on the energy consumption. This preliminary study is based on an empirical evaluation of a eight implementations of the Towers of Hanoi problem."

It allows to simulate different variants of a data center and to minimize the total energy consumption by optimizing equipment and operating parameters. Thus potential energy savings can be evaluated. Finally the resulting reduction of operation expenses can directly be derived from the energy savings."

In order to achieve this objective, a thorough understanding of the energy consumption patterns in complex Cloud environments is needed.

Empirical analysis of the correlation of energy consumption and Cloud data and computational tasks, as well as system performance, will be investigated based on our energy consumption model and analysis tool.

  "Abstract": "As the use of computers has grown, so too has concern about the amount of power they consume. Data centers, for example, are limited in scalability as they struggle with soaring energy costs from many large companies relying on fast, reliable, and round-the-clock computing services. On large-scale computing clusters, like data centers, even a small drop in power consumption can have large effects. Across computing contexts, reducing power consumed by computers has become a major focus. In this paper, we present a new approach for mapping software design to power consumption and present empirical results of the approach on different software implementations. In particular, we compare the power profiles of software using design patterns against software not using design patterns as a way to explore how high-level design decisions affect an application's energy usage. We show how mappings between software design and power consumption profiles can provide software designers and developers with useful information about the power behavior of the software they are developing. The goal is for software engineers to use this information in designing and developing more energy efficient solutions."

  "Abstract": "To achieve lower energy consumption many green strategies (e.g. virtualize applications and consolidate them on shared server machines, or optimize the usage of the private cloud by opening up to external consumers) have been discussed. In practice, however, the major incentive for a company to go green is reducing costs. While green strategies often focus on technical and environmental issues, they hardly address the economic impact that they may bring. If green strategies do not lead to an explicit (and significant) reduction of costs (hence increase in revenues) they are nice but not part of the business strategy of the company. In this paper we propose a green strategy model that provides decision makers with the information needed to decide on whether to take green strategies and eventually how to align them with their business strategies. This model provides a means to codify green strategies in such a way that the link between green strategies, their economic impact and green goals becomes explicit. We applied the model in a case study to codify 132 green actions collected from Dutch data centers. This exercise further confirmed the advantage of using the proposed model and helped us identifying future improvements."

  "Abstract": "As environmental sustainability issues have come to the societal and governmental forefront, a new breed of Green Information Systems (IS)—Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) Green IS—is emerging. A ULS Green IS is an open socio-technical ecosystem that differs from traditional IS in scale, complexity and urgency. Design issues found in ULS systems, System of Systems, Edge-dominant, Metropolis systems and Green IS converge and multiply in the ULS Green IS context. This paper presents a design framework and an architecture analysis method, ECO-ARCH, to address the design of such systems. Through an action research study on architecting for Demand Response systems in the Smart Grid, this article illuminates the system characteristics of ULS Green IS and endorses a fundamental shift in design thinking for its design – from \"bounded rationality\" for problem solving to \"expandable rationality\" for design for the unknown and for innovation. ECO-ARCH advances existing software architecture analysis methods by complimenting expandable rationality design thinking with proven engineering techniques in a dual-level macroscopic-microscopic analysis. This tackles the unique architecting problems of ULS Green IS where many stakeholders are unknown and design goals are not provided, where no architecture pre-exists, where system behavior is non-deterministic and continuously evolving, and where co-creation with consumers and prosumers is essential to achieving triple bottom line goals."

  "Abstract": "We consider the overhead incurred by programs that can be updated dynamically and argue that, in general, and regardless of the mechanism used, the program must incur an overhead during normal execution. We argue that the overhead during normal execution of the updateable program need not be as high as the overhead for the updated program. In light of the fundamental limitations and the differences in the overhead that must be incurred by the updateable and updated programs, we propose a new mechanism for dynamic software update based on a new shifting gears approach. The mechanism attempts to incur just the required overhead depending on the stage of update the application is in. Before an update the execution incurs low overhead and when an update occurs the execution incurs higher overhead which reverts to low overhead as the execution progresses. We evaluate the mechanism by modifying an application by hand. Preliminary performance numbers show that the mechanism performs better than existing mechanisms for dynamic software update."

  "Abstract": "Dynamic software updating (DSU) techniques show great promise in allowing vital software services to be upgraded without downtime, avoiding dropped connections and the loss of critical program state. For multithreaded programs, DSU systems must balance correctness and timeliness. To simplify reasoning that an update is correct, we could limit updates to take place only when all threads have blocked at well-defined update points. However, several researchers have pointed out that this approach poses the risk of delaying an update for too long, even indefinitely, and therefore have developed fairly complicated mechanisms to mitigate the risk. This paper argues that such mechanisms are unnecessary by demonstrating empirically that many multithreaded programs can be updated with minimal delay using only a small number of manually annotated update points. Our study of the time taken for all of the threads in six real-world, event-driven programs to reach their update points ranged from 0.155 to 107.558 ms, and most were below 1 ms."

We believe that using better evaluation criteria can guide DSU research to produce systems that will be more practical, flexible, and usable."

To handle more complex state transformations, the framework includes a number of extension mechanisms designed to minimize the overall programming effort. Our experience with real-world programs suggests that our framework can handle all the standard C idioms and support safe and automated state transfer for complex state changes. We believe our approach is effective in several update scenarios and significantly raises the bar on the security and reliability of live update."

First, it provides a simple semantics to the developer, while allowing upgrades to occur atomically, concurrently with the execution of the program. Second, it converts the program's data lazily, as data is progressively accessed by the execution of the upgraded program. We present also experimental results that show that our lazy approach to software upgrades is able to upgrade a system without affecting significantly the maximum response time of the system's operations, whereas an immediate approach shows values of maximum response time up to three orders of magnitude higher."

  "Abstract": "Deploying and upgrading software systems is typically a labourious, error prone and tedious task. To deal with the complexity of a software deployment process and to make this process more reliable, we have developed Nix, a purely functional package manager as well as an extension called Disnix, capable of deploying service-oriented systems in a network of machines. Nix and its applications only support deployment of immutable components, which never change after they have been built. However, not all components of a software system are immutable, such as databases. These components must be deployed by other means, which makes deployment and upgrades of such systems difficult, especially in large networks. In this paper, we analyse the properties of mutable components and we propose Dysnomia, a deployment extension for mutable components."

The main idea of our algorithm is to guide the control flow graph exploration first to the paths that traverse through the changed nodes in the graph. We implemented this idea on top of the concolic model checker ExpliSAT and the experimental results on real programs show a significant improvement in performance compared to re-verification of the whole program, when the change involves a small fraction of paths on the control flow graph."

  "Abstract": "Software updates present a difficult challenge to the software maintenance process. Too often, updates result in failures, and users face the uncomfortable choice between using an old stable version which misses recent features and bug fixes, and using a new version which improves the software in certain ways, only to introduce other bugs and security vulnerabilities. \\n\\nIn this position paper, we propose a radically new approach for performing software updates. whenever a new update becomes available, instead of upgrading the software to the new version, we instead run the new version in parallel with the old one. By carefully coordinating their executions and selecting the behavior of the more reliable version when they diverge, we can preserve the stability of the old version without giving up the features and bug fixes added to the new version. \\n\\nWe are currently focusing on a prototype system targeting multicore CPUs, but we believe this approach could also be deployed on other parallel platforms, such as GPGPUs and cloud environments."

The server can switch from one context to another incrementally in order to process incoming requests. Our approach has the following characteristics. (1) updatability is defined and added to the application by developers, (2) no syntax is added to the language and the update is controlled via the manipulation of objects, (3) the whole system is migrated lazily and eventually replaces the old system, (4) it is safe to update global entities anytime and there is no need to reach update points. We demonstrate our approach by updating the Jetty web server."

It uses groups of tokens extracted from source code called windowed-tokens. From these, frequency vectors are then constructed and compared with the Manhattan distance in a metric tree. The goal of this new technique is to provide a very high precision clone detection technique while keeping a high recall. Precision and recall measurement is done with respect to the Levenshtein distance. The testbench is a large scale open source software. The collected results proved the technique to be fast, simple, and accurate. Finally, this article presents further research opportunities."

There is currently not enough empirical evidence to provide concrete information about these claims. This paper presents the results of a survey of members of the code clone community. The goal of the survey was to determine the level of agreement of community members regarding some key topics. While the results showed a good bit of agreement, there was no universal consensus on all topics. Survey respondents were not in complete agreement about the definitions of Type III and Type IV clones. The survey respondents were more uncertain about how developers behave when working with clones. From the survey it is clear that there are areas where more empirical research is needed to better understand how to effectively work with clones."

We report the results of analyzing clone detection for NAV using two previously published methods and one new algorithmic method. character-based sliding window sampling using Rabin-Karp hashing (MOSS), line-based sequence matching using suffix trees (CodeDup), and abstract-syntax-tree based graph sharing analysis (XMLClone). The latter is piggybacked on XMLStore, which stores XML trees as directed acyclic graphs (dags) where all isomorphic subtrees are identified and coalesced into single nodes, which can be done in linear time using multiset discrimination. This dagification discovers all well-formed Type-1 and, with suitable input normalization, Type-2 clones. We find that the subsequent dag analysis to discover Type-3 clones performs well on NAV source code, both in terms of computational complexity and precision. This suggests that efficient dagification and independently configurable dag interpretation may be valuable ingredients for modular clone detection."

  "Abstract": "Currently, the impacts of clones in software maintenance activities are being investigated by different researchers in different ways. Comparative stability analysis of cloned and non-cloned regions of a subject system is a well-known way of measuring the impacts where the hypothesis is that, the more a region is stable the less it is harmful for maintenance. Each of the existing stability measurement methods lacks to address one important characteristic, dispersion, of the changes happening in the cloned and non-cloned regions of software systems. Change dispersion of a particular region quantifies the extent to which the changes are scattered over that region. The intuition is that, more dispersed changes require more efforts to be spent in the maintenance phase. \\n\\nMeasurement of Dispersion requires the extraction of method genealogies. In this paper, we have measured the dispersions of changes in cloned and non-cloned regions of several subject systems using a concurrent and robust framework for method genealogy extraction. We implemented the framework on Actor Architecture platform which facilitates coarse grained parallelism with asynchronous message passing capabilities. Our experimental results with 12 open-source subject systems written in three different programming languages (Java, C and C#) using two clone detection tools suggest that, the changes in cloned regions are more dispersed than the changes in non-cloned regions. Also, Type-3 clones exhibit more dispersion as compared to the Type-1 and Type-2 clones. The subject systems written in Java and C show higher dispersions as well as increased maintenance efforts as compared to the subject systems written in C#."

  "Abstract": "While finding clones in source code has drawn considerable attention, there has been only very little work in finding similar fragments in binary code and intermediate languages, such as Java bytecode. Some recent studies showed that it is possible to find distinct sets of clone pairs in bytecode representation of source code, which are not always detectable at source code-level. In this paper, we present a bytecode clone detection approach, called SeByte, which exploits the benefits of compilers (the bytecode representation) for detecting a specific type of semantic clones in Java bytecode. SeByte is a hybrid metric-based approach that takes advantage of both, Semantic Web technologies and Set theory. We use a two-step analysis process. (1) pattern matching via Semantic Web querying and reasoning, and (2) content matching, using Jaccard coefficient for set similarity measurement. Semantic Web-based pattern matching helps us to find method blocks which share similar patterns even in case of extreme dissimilarity (e.g., numerous repetitions or large gaps). Although it leads to high recall, it gives high false positive rate. We thus use the content matching (via Jaccard) to reduce false positive rate by focusing on content semantic resemblance. Our evaluation of four Java systems and five other tools shows that SeByte can detect a large number of semantic clones that are either not detected or supported by source code based clone detectors."

  "Abstract": "The object-oriented design is the most popular design methodology of the last twenty-five years. Several design patterns and principles are defined to improve the design quality of object-oriented software systems. In addition, designers can use unique design motifs which are particular for the specific application domain. Another common habit is cloning and modifying some parts of the software while creating new modules. Therefore, object-oriented programs can include many identical design structures. This work proposes a sub-graph mining based approach to detect identical design structures in object-oriented systems. By identifying and analyzing these structures, we can obtain useful information about the design, such as commonly-used design patterns, most frequent design defects, domain-specific patterns, and design clones, which may help developers to improve their knowledge about the software architecture. Furthermore, problematic parts of frequent identical design structures are the appropriate refactoring opportunities because they affect multiple areas of the architecture. Experiments with several open-source projects show that we can successfully find many identical design structures in each project. We observe that usually most of the identical structures are an implementation of common design patterns; however we also detect various anti-patterns, domain-specific patterns, and design-level clones."

  "Affiliations": ["Metaware Technologies, France"],
  "Abstract": "Most advanced existing tools for clone-based refactoring propose a limited number of pre-defined clone-removal transformations that can be applied automatically, typically under user control. This fixed set of refactorings usually guarantee that semantics is preserved, but is inherently limited to generally-applicable transformations (extract method, pull-up method, etc.). This tool design rules out many potential domain-specific or application-specific clone removals. Such cases are ordinarily recognized by humans as stereotypes derived from a higher-level concept and manually replaced with an appropriate abstraction. Thus, in current tools, generality is sacrificed for the safety of the transformation. This paper proposes an alternative approach, in which the spectrum of refactoring techniques is open, including manual interventions, while keeping strong safety guarantees based on the notion of iso-generation. Our method can operate on multiple languages and has been prototyped on a subset of a real-world legacy asset containing C and COBOL programs, with promising results."

This sequence of operations, termed copy-paste-modify, has the downside of proliferating \"nearly identical\" code segments or code clones and could lead to rapid degeneration of code. Although techniques for proactive identification of clones and differences between them have been studied, no clear method to control clone formation, based on \"acceptability criteria,\" is known. In this paper, we present a technique to moderate the genesis of clones through copy-paste-modify operations. Our approach is guided by associating constraints formulated from predefined guidelines, and checking for their satisfaction at the time of copy and upon modification. By encoding \"acceptability criteria\" as constraints, our approach provides the means necessary for controlled creation of clones."

So far, several studies performed on the analysis of clone evolution in OSS. However, to our knowledge, a few research have been reported on an application of a clone change management system to industrial development process. In this paper, we propose a clone change management system based on the categorization of clone evolution, and then present case study of industrial application. In case study, we confirmed that the proposed system suggested two unintentionally developed clones in a half of the month."

Current clone management techniques concentrate on providing editing tools that allow developers to easily inspect clone instances, track their evolution, and check change consistency. In this position paper, we argue that better clone management can be achieved by responding to the fundamental needs of industry practitioners. And the possible research directions include a software problem-oriented taxonomy of clones, and a better structured clone detection report. We believe this line of research should inspire new techniques, and reach to a much wider range of professionals from both the research and industry community."

Some approaches have used suffix trees [1], [3]; others have used variations of longest common substring algorithms [4], [5]. This paper outlines an algorithm, embodied in a new tool called ctcompare, that takes a different tokenization approach. Each code base to be compared is first lexically analysed to produce a sequence of tokens. These are then broken into overlapping tuples of N consecutive tokens. The tuples are then hashed and the hash values of token tuples are used to identify type-1 and type-2 clone pairs. Hashed token sequences combined with a database have already been used in earlier ctcompare versions and elsewhere [2], but with a significant performance penalty due to database insertions. The benefits of this approach over the existing research include the simultaneous comparison of multiple large code bases and fast absolute performance."

Current modeling methods that support availability modeling are not based on a rigorous modeling theory. Therefore, when the behavior of the system influences the availability, as it is the case for fault-tolerant systems, the resulting analysis is imprecise or relies on external information. Based on a probabilistic extension of the FOCUS theory, we present a modeling technique that allows specifiying availability with a clear semantics. This semantics is a transformation of the original behavior to one that includes failures. Our approach enables modeling and verifying availability properties in the same way as system behavior."

To overcome these problems, many approaches exist that focus on modeling these functional dependencies in advance, i.e., in the specification or the design of a system. However, there is little empirical data on the amount of such interactions between system functions in realistic systems. In this paper, we analyze structural models of a modern realistic automotive vehicle system with the aim to assess the extent and characteristics of interactions between system functions. Our results show that at least 69% of the analyzed system functions depend on each other or influence each other. These dependencies stretch all over the system whereby single system functions have dependencies to up to 40% of all system functions. These results challenge the current development methods and processes that treat system functions more or less as independent units of functionality."

Design and code can co-evolve with Archface at the center of the development process. This paper proposes a verifiable architectural interface that can check the traceability between design and code. For this checking, we use an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver, a tool for deciding the satisfiability of logical formulas. Adopting our approach, we can construct MDD tools supporting adequate abstraction level when they generate code, recover a design model from code, and check the traceability between a design model and its code."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Alabama, USA"],
  "Abstract": "Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) have received recent interest due to their conciseness and rich expressiveness for modeling a specific domain. However, DSML adoption has several challenges because development of a new DSML requires both domain knowledge and language development expertise (e.g., defining abstract/concrete syntax and specifying semantics). Abstract syntax is generally defined in the form of a metamodel, with semantics associated to the metamodel. Thus, designing a metamodel is a core DSML development activity. Furthermore, DSMLs are often developed incrementally by iterating across complex language development tasks. An iterative and incremental approach is often preferred because the approach encourages end-user involvement to assist with verifying the DSML correctness and feedback on new requirements. However, if there is no tool support, iterative and incremental DSML development can be mundane and error-prone work. To resolve issues related to DSML development, we introduce a new approach to create DSMLs from a set of domain model examples provided by an end-user. The approach focuses on (1) the identification of concrete syntax, (2) inducing abstract syntax in the form of a metamodel, and (3) inferring static semantics from a set of domain model examples. In order to generate a DSML from user-supplied examples, our approach uses graph theory and metamodel design patterns."

  "Abstract": "Software development processes are becoming more collaborative, trying to integrate end-users as much as possible. The idea is to advance towards a community-driven process where all actors (both technical and non- technical) work together to ensure that the system-to-be will satisfy all expectations. This seems specially appropriate in the field of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) typically designed to facilitate the development of software for a particular domain. DSLs offer constructs closer to the vocabulary of the domain which simplifies the adoption of the DSL by end-users. Interestingly enough, the development of DSLs is not a collaborative process itself. In this sense, the goal of this paper is to propose a collaborative infrastructure for the development of DSLs where end-users have a direct and active participation in the evolution of the language. This infrastructure is based on Collaboro, a DSL to represent change proposals, possible solutions and comments arisen during the development and evolution of a language."

SMT-LIB is an standard input language that is supported by the state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo theory solvers (SMT solvers). The recent advances in SMT solvers have introduced them as efficient analysis tools; as a result, they are becoming more popular in the verification and certification of digital products. SMT-LIB was designed to be machine readable rather than human readable. In this paper, we present Avestan, a declarative modelling language that is intended to be analyzed by SMT solvers and readable by humans. An Avestan model is translated to an SMT-LIB model so that it can be analyzed by different SMT solvers. Avestan has relational constructs that are heavily inspired by Alloy; we added these constructs to increase the readability of an Avestan model."

  "Abstract": "Cloud computing is emerging as a major trend in the ICT industry. While most of the attention of the research community is focused on considering the perspective of the Cloud providers, offering mechanisms to support scaling of resources and interoperability and federation between Clouds, the perspective of developers and operators willing to choose the Cloud without being strictly bound to a specific solution is mostly neglected. We argue that Model-Driven Development can be helpful in this context as it would allow developers to design software systems in a cloud-agnostic way and to be supported by model transformation techniques into the process of instantiating the system into specific, possibly, multiple Clouds. The MODACLOUDS (MOdel-Driven Approach for the design and execution of applications on multiple Clouds) approach we present here is based on these principles and aims at supporting system developers and operators in exploiting multiple Clouds for the same system and in migrating (part of) their systems from Cloud to Cloud as needed. MODACLOUDS offers a quality-driven design, development and operation method and features a Decision Support System to enable risk analysis for the selection of Cloud providers and for the evaluation of the Cloud adoption impact on internal business processes. Furthermore, MODACLOUDS offers a run-time environment for observing the system under execution and for enabling a feedback loop with the design environment. This allows system developers to react to performance fluctuations and to re-deploy applications on different Clouds on the long term."

  "Abstract": "Model-to-text (M2T) transformation is an important model management operation, as it is used to implement code and documentation generation; model serialisation (enabling model interchange); and model visualisation and exploration. Despite the creation of the MOF Model-To-Text Transformation Language (MOFM2T) in 2008, many very different M2T languages exist today. Because there is little interoperability between M2T languages and rewriting an existing M2T transformation in a new language is costly, developers face a difficult choice when selecting a M2T language. In this paper, we use domain analysis to identify a preliminary feature model for M2T languages. We demonstrate the appropriateness of the feature model by describing two different M2T languages, and discuss potential applications for a tool-supported and model-driven approach to describing the features of M2T languages."

  "Abstract": "Model transformations are traditionally designed to operate on models that do not contain uncertainty. In previous work, we have developed partial models, i.e., models that explicitly capture uncertainty. In this paper, we study the transformation of partial models. We define the notion of correct lifting of transformations so that they can be applied to partial models. For this, we encode transformations as em transfer predicates and describe the mechanics of applying transformations using logic. We demonstrate the approach using two example transformations (addition and deletion) and outline a method for testing the application of transformations using a SAT solver. Reflecting on these preliminary attempts, we discuss the main limitations and challenges and outline future steps for our research on partial model transformation."

  "Abstract": "Model driven engineering advocates the separa- tion of concerns during the design time of a system, which leads to the creation of several different models, using several different syntaxes. However, to reason on the overall system, we need to compose these models. Unfortunately, composition of models is done in an ad hoc way, preventing comparison, capitalisation and reuse of the composition operators. In order to improve comprehension and allow comparison of merging and weaving operators, we use category theory to propose a unified framework to formally define merging and weaving of models. We successfully use this framework to compare them, both through the way they are transformed in the formalism, and through several properties, such as completeness or non- redundancy. Finally, we validate this framework by checking that it correctly identifies three tools as performing merging or weaving of models."

This is due to numerous variants in the description of the task to achieve and its execution context as well as in the assembly of software components. We have modeled variability for large scale systems using feature diagrams, a formalism well suited for modeling variablility. These models are built with a clear separation of concerns between specification and implementation aspects. They are used at design and deployment time as well as at execution time. \\n\\nOur test application domain is video surveillance systems, from a software engineering perspective. These are good candidates to put model driven engineering to the test, because of the huge variability in both the surveillance tasks and the video analysis algorithms. They are also dynamically adaptive systems, thus suitable for models at run time approaches. \\n\\nWe propose techniques and tools to define the models, to operate on them, and to transform specification requirements into an effective implementation of a processing chain. We also define a run time architecture to integrate models into the adaptation loop."

  "Abstract": "Visibility of technical debt is critical. A lack thereof can lead to significant problems without adequate visibility as part of the system level decision-making processes [2]. Current approaches for analysing and monitoring architecture related debt are based on dependency analysis to detect code level violations of the software architecture [2,3,6]. However, heterogeneous environments with several systems constructed using COTS, and/or several programming languages may not offer sufficient code visibility. Other limiting factors include legal contracts, Intellectual Property Rights, and just very large systems. Secondly, the complexity of a software dependency is often greater than simple structural dependencies, including; multi-dimensional properties (as argued by [10]); behavioural dependencies [5,9]; and ‘implicit’ dependencies (i.e., dependency inter-relatedness [11]). This paper proposes a simple modelling approach for visualising dependency relationships as an extension of the current approaches, while supporting complex dependencies. The model can be built using existing dependency analysis and general architectural knowledge; thus is better suited for heterogeneous environments. We demonstrate the proposed modelling using an exemplar, and two field case studies."

This paper proposes three alternative models for determining the production value of software, based on the notions of technical debt and interest.

We present the valuation results and discuss the weaknesses and strengths of the models."

Deferring defects accumulates a technical debt that burdens the software team and customer with a less than optimal solution. The decision to defer fixing a defect is made by Software Change Control Boards (CCBs) based on a set of decision factors. In this paper, we evaluated the set of decision factors used by two CCBs at ABB in the context of technical debt management. The aim was to determine how a model of cost and benefits of incurring technical debt could be part of the CCB decision process. We identified the cost categories and decision factors for fixing and deferring defects as a result of interviews with CCB members. We found that the decision factors could incorporate the financial aspects when using the technical debt metaphor. We identify opportunities for further research to integrate technical debt concepts with the decision factors towards better long term outcomes."

  "Affiliations": ["University of British Columbia, Canada"],
  "Abstract": "Technical debt is the trading of long-term software quality in favor of short-term expediency. While the concept has traditionally been applied to tradeoffs at the code and architecture phases, it also manifests itself in the system requirements analysis phase. Little attention has been paid to requirements over time in software. requirements are often badly out of synch with the implementation, or not used at all. However, requirements are the ultimate validation of project success, since they are the manifestation of the stakeholder’s desires for the system. In this position paper, we define technical debt in requirements as the distance between the implementation and the actual state of the world. We highlight how a requirements modeling tool, RE-KOMBINE, makes requirements, domain constraints and implementation first-class concerns. RE-KOMBINE represents technical debt using the notion of optimal solutions to a requirements problem. We show how this interpretation of technical debt may be useful in deciding how much requirements analysis is sufficient."

  "Abstract": "Global software engineering (GSE) is a business strategy to realize a business idea (i.e. the development project) faster, through round-the-clock productivity. However, GSE creates a volatile and unstable process in which many actors interact together against unpredictable premises (e.g. cultural or time differences), often producing unexpected outcomes (e.g. compacting effects of distance and time). So far, Scrum has been used extensively for embarking in global software engineering, but many of the problems in Scrum-based GSE could still benefit from the usage of ad-hoc supporting tools (e.g. information continuity between timezones, cultural differences, developers awareness, etc.). Agile Service Networks (ASNs) are networks of service oriented applications (nodes) that collaborate adaptively towards a common goal. ASNs offer a way to represent GSE professionals through service-oriented \"social\" nodes in a \"small-world\" network (much like a Facebook for a specific GSE project). This paper presents a comparison between the two approaches, namely Scrum and ASNs, to determine ASN’s potentials as mechanisms to maintain awareness in GSE."

However, the modeling of non-functional properties of service choreographies is neglected in the OMG standard BPMN notation, so that other, separate languages should be used to specify QoS constraints and then traced back to the functional BPMN model. We introduced an approach called Q4BPMN by which non-functional requirements can be directly expressed within the BPMN model. This paper leverages Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques to automatically handle non-functional properties expressed with Q4BPMN in order to obtain information useful both to highlight intrinsic features of the service choreography and to detect possible model criticalities. Specifically, we transform a Q4BPMN model into the pivot KLAPER notation, on which we can directly exploit the analysis tools within the KLAPERSUITE environment. Hence this paper provides the first step towards automated non-functional analysis of service choreographies."

All these systems are progressively integrated in our daily environment and their increasing importance have raised a dependability issue. While Service oriented architecture is providing a good level of abstraction to deal with the complexity and heterogeneity of these new infrastructures, current approaches are limited in their ability to monitor and ensure the system dependability. In this paper, we propose a framework for the autonomic management of service oriented application based on a dependability objective. Our framework proposes a novel approach which leverages peer to peer evaluation of service providers to assess the system dependability. Based on this evaluation, we propose various strategies to dynamically adapt the system to maintain the dependability level of the system to the desired objective."

  "Abstract": "Software services are often composed into more complex systems. Existing methods ensure the correctness of service compositions by automatically generating a mediator/adaptor service. a service in the middle to properly coordinate the interactions in the system towards satisfying a desired temporal property. This is accomplished using formal behavioural models for the participating services. However, such models are not always provided, which makes it difficult to compose systems containing incompletely specified services. We developed a black-box model learning method specifically adapted for stateful asynchronous services. Often, such services exhibit uncontrollable behaviour, which is not addressed by current learning techniques. Our technique interleaves runtime exploration with model refinement in order to learn an approximation of the real behaviour that allows for a safe system composition. Furthermore, the service model is learned locally, thus allowing parallelism in the inference process when more than one black-box service model has to be learned. Experiments performed show that obtained models are precise enough to be used for adaptor synthesis."

  "Abstract": "Constraint-based Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is a method for predicting violations of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in an executing instance of a service orchestration. It uses assumptions about the ranges of QoS values for component services in the orchestration. Experiments suggest that the method, when given correct component QoS assumptions, produces highly accurate predictions according to a series of quality-of-prediction metrics, and that it does so well ahead of the time when the prediction is to happen. We study the behavior of this method when the component QoS assumptions become incorrect or too vague. We conclude that the effect is a graceful deterioration in prediction quality, unless gross (order-of-magnitude) imprecisions are introduced. However, the method is very sensitive to the loss of information on the lower bounds for component QoS values, since the knowledge of the upper bounds is not sufficient for failure prediction."

  "Abstract": "Information hiding and hierarchical decomposition are the corner stone of Software Engineering best practices. These principles have been applied in methods, architectures, programming languages, and run-time platforms. It is therefore a big surprise to notice that the recent dynamic service platforms, like OSGi, do not make use of these principles. In OSGi, all services are visible; a client asking for an interface will be wired to any service, randomly selected and implementing that interface,which makes almost impossible protection and encapsulation. Nevertheless, OSGi is very successful for its almost unique capability to support dynamicity; and because the current practice is to run a single application per platform. Unfortunately, the future of gateways, like OSGi, is to manage the \"discovery\", access and control of resources (logical as well as physical (sensors, devices)) shared by many applications. In the near future, OSGi will have to scale from a light weight mono-application gateway to a full-fledged dynamic platform. We have developed a layer on top of OSGi called APlication Abstract Machine (Apam) which provides OSGi dynamic capabilities, but also introduces a composite concept allowing multiple applications to cover the range isolation/collaboration from \"black-box\" (information hiding and hierarchical decomposition) to \"scrambled eggs\" as in service platforms, and through a variety of grey and white boxes with variable degrees of collaboration, sharing and control. The paper presents the state of practice, the challenges future dynamic platforms have to address, and how the Apam platform provides a solution to these issues. An assessment of the first Apam experimentations concludes the paper."

  "Abstract": "Quality assurance techniques have been developed to supervise the service quality (QoS) agreed between service-based systems (SBSs) consumers and providers. Such QoS is usually included in service level agreements (SLAs) and thus, SLA monitoring platforms have been developed supporting violation detection. However, just a few of them provide explanation of the violations caused by observed QoS at monitoring time, but not in an user-friendly format. Therefore, we propose a general monitoring and analysis conceptual reference model and we instantiated it with SALMonADA, a SBS that notifies the clients with violations and their causes in their own easy-to-understand specification terms. In addition, our platform performs an early analysis notification that avoids delays in the client notification time when a violation takes place. Moreover, we have implemented a web application as a SALMonADA client, to prove how it monitors, analyses and reports to their clients the service level fulfillment of real services subject to a SLA specified with WS-Agreement."

Initial efforts to adopt SPL in their software production proved successful. However, they still need to leverage variability modeling to the software and system level, integrating it to their existing model-based development. Therefore, this work aims at (i) presenting an industrial scenario and identifying the main challenges to leverage variability modeling for it, (ii) outlining our point of view and perspectives on how these challenges can be addressed, and (iii) discussing the suitability of current variability modeling approaches."

Complexity which may greatly reduce the trustworthiness of a system is the key reason.

In this paper, we present a framework of SPL-to-srSoS to extend SPL practices to srSoS and argue its value-enhancement effects by rapidly meeting increased complexity and emergent behaviors of System of Systems (SoS). The framework employs a basic principle of system hiding, and consists of a SPL-to-srSoS process model and an initially conceived value model. A successfully deployed FISCAN srSoS at Airports provides demonstration for the discussion throughout the paper."

Resources are accessed on demand by customers and are delivered as services by cloud providers in a pay-per-use model. Companies provide their applications as services and rely on cloud providers to provision, host and manage such applications on top of their infrastructure. However, the wide range of cloud solutions and the lack of knowledge in this domain is a real problem for companies when facing the cloud solution choice. In this paper, we propose to use Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) and Feature Model (FM) configuration to develop a decision-supporting tool. Using such modelling techniques and automations, this tool takes into consideration the application technical requirements as well as the user quality requirements to provide an accurate result among cloud solutions that best fits both requirements."

Software Product Lines (SPL) framework must provide bi-directional traceability between requirements and low level software assets (e.g. code and test), facilitate production of certification deliverables, allow validation on the target platform and provide code coverage. Also, SPL offer a scheme to manage the complexity of avionics software systems through variability management tools."

These markets now heavily rely on interactive configurators that help customers build complete and correct products. Reliability is thus a critical requirement for configurators. Yet, our experience in industry reveals that many configurators are developed in an ad hoc manner, raising correctness and maintenance issues. In this paper, we present a vision to re-engineering more reliable configurators and the challenges it poses. The first challenge is to reverse engineer from an existing configurator the variability information, including complex rules, and to consolidate it in a variability model, namely a feature model. The second challenge is to forward engineer a new configurator that uses the feature model to generate a customized graphical user interface and the underlying reasoning engine."

Here the importance of integrating whole processes rather than simply integrate databases or software applications. Seeing the duality between products and processes, we propose to exploit flexibility provided by the product-line engineering approach for modeling business processes as a Business Process Line (BPL) in order to capture process variability, promote reuse and integration and provide the capacity to anticipate process changes. To support process evolution and consistency, we suggest the use of decision tables to elicit, track and manage all the emerging decision points during business process modeling, with the purpose of maintaining the relationships among business needs, environmental changes and process tasks. In a real case study we practiced the proposed methodology by leveraging the synergy of feature models, variability mechanisms and decision tables. The results prove that the BPL satisfies the requirements for business process flexibility."

The technique scales well for many compared system variants and for large software systems. We think Variant Analysis could be useful for practitioners who need to identify source-level similarities between many potentially unknown software systems – either with the primary goal of understanding the variability in the systems, or with a further motivation such as preparation for an extractive introduction of the product line approach."

  "Abstract": "This paper presents a practical solution to a real-life industrial problem in the unmanned space flight software (FSW) domain using software product lines and software architectural design patterns. In the FSW domain, there exists a significant amount of variability in the required capabilities. For example, some FSW have a significant amount of hardware to control and operate in a nearly autonomous fashion. In contrast, other FSW have a small amount of hardware to control and rely heavily of commanding from the ground station to operate the spacecraft. The underlying architecture and component interactions needed for the different FSWs are quite different. This amount of architectural variability makes it difficult to develop a SPL architecture that covers the all possible variability in the FSW domain. Therefore, this paper presents a practical solution to this real world problem that leverages software product line concepts and software architectural design patterns."

  "Abstract": "This work states that there is a need for an optimized problem space representation for heterogeneous domains. We identify two modeling paradigms widely used in practice. Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) and Feature-Oriented Domain Modeling (FODM). Each modeling paradigm favors different domain characteristics. Especially the fact that software often is embedded either in a system or in a process and, therefore, is strongly influenced by its environment enforces the demand for a combined representation. We propose a concept for a multi-modeling approach based on existing technology. Multi-modeling means the combina-tion of the two main modeling paradigms to represent a heterogeneous domain. The major benefit of the approach is the reduction of representation complexity by optimizing the representation of single subdomains. This will be shown on one representative case study from the automotive domain. Another advantage is the improved stakeholder communication because of familiar notations. A discussion of limitations shows potential for future work."

Therefore, applying SPL reuse principles also to test artifacts in a concise way is essential. We address this open issue by a novel, model-based SPL testing framework based on reusable delta-oriented state machine test models and regression-based test suite evolution. Therein, SPL test artifacts are incrementally evolved for every product variant by explicitly considering commonality and variability between two subsequent products under test. Our approach guarantees for every product configuration stable test coverage and allows the derivation of redundancy-reduced, yet reliable retesting obligations. We illustrate our framework by means of an automotive case study and compare our experimental results with alternative SPL testing strategies w.r.t. efficiency improvements."

SPL provide mechanisms to control the evolution and design of product families, based on an exhaustive variant analysis. However, the critical system industry does not adopt them due to the lack of tool support for the complete life-cycle. In this paper, a product line tool chain is presented based on the analysis of current SPL tools and approaches in order to fit the specific needs within industry partners in the CESAR project. The main goal is to show the benefits of a combination of SPL tools in an industrial scenario."

Our approach relies on knowledge representations of both structural and dynamic aspects of components and processing chains. The paper concentrates more precisely on run time adaptation to cope with context changes. Run time policies are expressed by means of inference rules. At run time an inference engine uses these rules to orchestrate the component chain, in particular to achieve run time adaptations, such as component parameter tuning or re-assembly of the processing chain. We describe the general evaluation-repair mechanism which involves to evaluate environment changes and execution results and then to trigger the suitable reconfigurations."

  "Abstract": "Mutation testing has traditionally been used to evaluate the effectiveness of test suites and provide confidence in the testing process. Mutation testing involves the creation of many versions of a program each with a single syntactic fault. A test suite is evaluated against these program versions (mutants) in order to determine the percentage of mutants a test suite is able to identify (mutation score). A major drawback of mutation testing is that even a small program may yield thousands of mutants and can potentially make the process cost prohibitive. To improve the performance and reduce the cost of mutation testing, we propose a machine learning approach to predict mutation score based on a combination of source code and test suite metrics."

  "Abstract": "Software maintenance can become monotonous and expensive due to ignorance and misapplication of appropriate design patterns during the early phases of design and development. To have a good and reusable system, designers and developers must be aware of large information set and many quality concerns, e.g., design patterns. Systems with correct design pattern may ensure easy maintenance and evolution. However, without assistance, designing and development of software systems following certain design patterns is difficult for engineers. Recommendation systems for software engineering can assist designers and developers with a wide range of activities including suggesting design patterns. With the help of pattern recommenders, designers can come up with a reusable design. We provide a Design Pattern Recommender (DPR) process overview for software design to suggest design patterns, based on a simple Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach. Our prototype provides two-fold solution. In the primary-level, DPR only proposes one or more design patterns for a problem context, and in the secondary level, for a initial set of design, DPR refactors models and suggests design patterns. Our preliminary evaluation shows that DPR has a good trade-off between accuracy and procedural complexity, comparing to other state-of-the-art approaches."

  "Abstract": "In large projects parallelization of existing programs or refactoring of source code is time consuming as well as error-prone and would benefit from tool support. However, existing automatic transformation systems are not extensively used because they either require tedious definitions of source code transformations or they lack general adaptability. In our approach, a programmer changes code inside a project, resulting in before and after source code versions. The difference (the generated transformation) is stored in a database. When presented with some arbitrary code, our tool mines the database to determine which of the generalized transformations possibly apply. Our system is different from a pure compiler based (semantics preserving) approach as we only suggest code modifications. \\n\\nOur contribution is a set of generalizing annotations that we have found by analyzing recurring patterns in open source projects. We show the usability of our system and the annotations by finding matches and applying generated transformations in real-world applications."

This paper proposes an approach for recommending library elements for domain specific languages. We instantiate the approach for Simulink models and evaluate it by recommending library blocks for a body of 165 Simulink files from a public repository. We compare two alternative variants for computing recommendations. association rules and collaborative filtering. Our results indicate that the collaborative filtering approach performs better and produces recommendations for Simulink models with satisfactory precision and recall."

This new resource has scarcely been acknowledged by any Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Even though developers spend a large part of their working time in IDEs, and the usage of Q&amp;A services has dramatically increased, developers can only use such resources using external applications. \\n\\nWe introduce Seahawk, an Eclipse plugin to integrate Stack Overflow crowd knowledge in the IDE. It allows developers to seamlessly access Stack Overflow data, thus obtaining answers without switching the context. We present our preliminary work on Seahawk. It allows users to (1) retrieve Q&amp;A from Stack Overflow, (2) link relevant discussions to any source code in Eclipse, and (3) attach explanative comments to the links."

Increasing complexity and fast evolving technologies cause deficits in development and system behavior. They cause discrepancies between expectations and observations. We propose using discrepancies as a trigger for recommendations to developers. Discrepancies in using a software application are combined with discrepancies between development artifacts. To efficiently support software engineers, recommendations must consider knowledge bases of discrepancies and resolution options. They evolve over time along with evolving experience. Hence, recommendations and organizational learning are intertwined."

We present Example Overflow, a code search and recommendation tool which brings together social media and code recommendation systems. Example Overflow enables crowd-sourced software development by utilizing both textual and social information, which accompany source code on the Web. Its browsing mechanism minimizes the context switch associated with other code search tools.

In this paper, we describe a novel approach to identify the most critical decisions in product selection/configuration by taking advantage of a large pool of randomly generated, generally inconsistent, product variants. Range Ranking, a data mining technique, is utilized to single out the most critical design choices, reducing the job of the human designer to making less consequential decisions. A large feature model is used as a case study; we show preliminary results of the new approach to illustrate its usefulness for practical product derivation."

We propose a method that mechanically evaluates usefulness for our recommendation system called Selene. By using the proposed method, we adjusted several search and user-interface parameters in Selene for better recall factor, and also learned characteristics of those parameters."

Since artifacts have internal and external dependencies, a change will cause some changes on related artifacts. In order to guide change operations in software development, our proposed method generates a change guide graph by mining developers' interaction histories which consist of write and read accesses to artifacts. Using a change guide graph, we can guide change using the context of previous changes. To evaluate proposed change guide method, we perform a case study with an open- source software. We show that the context information is effective for file level and method level change predictions."

The performance of a particular prediction approach often highly depends on attributes like coding style or writing style of change request. Thus, we propose to use multiple prediction approaches in combination with machine learning. First experiments show that machine learning is well suitable to weight different prediction approaches for individual software projects and hence improve prediction performance."

  "Abstract": "For large software projects, system designers have to adhere to a significant number of functional and non-functional requirements, which makes software development a complex engineering task. If these requirements change during the development process, complexity even increases. In this paper, we suggest recommendation systems based on context-aware composition to enable a system designer to postpone and automate decisions regarding efficiency non-functional requirements, such as performance, and focus on the design of the core functionality of the system instead. \\n\\nContext-aware composition suggests the optimal component variants of a system for different static contexts (e.g., software and hardware environment) or even different dynamic contexts (e.g., actual parameters and resource utilization). Thus, an efficiency non-functional requirement can be automatically optimized statically or dynamically by providing possible component variants. Such a recommender system reduces time and effort spent on manually developing optimal applications that adapts to different (static or dynamic) contexts and even changes thereof."

The results of a preliminary experimentation are promising, showing that our approach performs better than a simple keyword-based approach."

In the S-Cube project the research group adopted a model-driven approach to support the communication about, and engineering of, service-oriented software. Models, views and viewpoints have been defined to support three main research problems in service-oriented software engineering. How to guide migration of legacy assets to services? How agile service networks can support virtual communities aimed at global software engineering? How to support architects and engineers to think in a service-oriented way?

In recent years, it has become even more difficult, because infrastructure solutions such as AmazonEC2, Cloudstack or RackSpace have increasingly rich capabilities, allowing for example, the infrastructure/platform/application dynamic adaptations. To address this challenge, in the context of the S-Cube Network of Excellence, we have proposed a domain specific modelling language to describe the whole Service-Based Applications layers entities using a models@runtime-based approach to cover the life-cycle of such applications. Our approach allows (i) to keep a representation of all the layers of a services-based applications, (ii) to coordinate the cross-layer reconfiguration and adaptations and (iii) to provide a support for infrastructure elasticity and (re)configuration to meet the resource requirements and some applications-specific constraints. The approach is implemented by a framework, named Kevoree. This paper summarizes the main concepts used in Kevoree and the main features designed in the context of the S-Cube project."

In this abstract, we address the problem of decomposition of business processes given a set of compliance rules. To summarize, we provide a sound categorization of contributing subformula occurrences in an artifact system $\\mathcal A$ w.r.t to an LTL-FO formula. We give a complexity result for computing an explanation of compliance. Furthermore, one provided a method to extract all explanations. This method is built on the computation of all the high level minimal unsatisfiable subsets of constraints in a Satisfiability Modulo Theory problem using uninterpreted predicates (relational) except for the following one ($\\mathbb N$, $&lt;$)."

  "Abstract": "Providers of composite Web services face the challenge of having to comply to SLAs, which are agreements governing the minimum performance that customers can expect from a composite service. In this work, a framework for optimizing adaptations of service compositions with regards to SLA violations has been developed. The framework, dubbed PREvent (Prediction and Prevention of SLA Violations Based on Events), uses techniques from the areas of machine learning and heuristic optimization to construct models for prediction of SLA violations at runtime, and to decide which adaptation actions may be used to improve overall performance in a composition instance. An optimizer component decides, whether applying these changes makes sense economically (i.e., whether the costs of violating the SLAs are bigger than the adaptation costs). If this is the case, the respective actions are applied in an automated way. At its core, PREvent is a self-optimizing system in the sense of autonomic computing, with the target of minimizing the total costs of adaptations and SLA violations for the service provider."

  "Abstract": "Heterogeneity of embedded systems leads to the development of variable software, such as software product lines. From such a family of programs, stakeholders select the specific variant that satisfies their functional requirements. However, different functionality exposes different non-functional properties of these variants. Especially in the embedded-system domain, non-functional requirements are vital, because resources are scarce. Hence, when selecting an appropriate variant, we have to fulfill also non-functional requirements. Since more systems are interconnected, the challenge is to find a variant that additionally satisfies global non-functional (or quality) requirements. In this paper, we advert the problem of achieving interoperability of non-functional requirements among multiple interacting systems using a real-world scenario. Furthermore, we show an approach to find optimal variants for multiple systems that reduces computation effort by means of a stepwise configuration process."

Designers must ensure that the software architecture meets its functional requirements and also, since embedded systems often have real-time constraints, meets its performance requirements. It is usually difficult to determine whether or not the embedded system designs will meet functional and performance requirements. To help increase confidence in embedded software architectures, designers often turn to executable model based approaches to assess their systems. There are many different approaches for designing and analyzing real-time embedded systems. This paper is intended to help designers in their choice by comparing two different executable model based approaches for designing and validating real-time embedded systems, namely state machines and colored Petri nets. Both approaches are compared using seven different comparison criteria and examples are given from a cruise control system case study."

  "Abstract": "Design of embedded systems involves a number of architecture decisions which have a significant impact on its quality. Due to the complexity of today's systems and the large design options that need to be considered, making these decisions is beyond the capabilities of human comprehension and makes the architectural design a challenging task. Several tools and frameworks have been developed, which automate the search for optimal or near-optimal design decisions based on quantitative architecture evaluations for different quality attributes. However, current approaches use approximations for a series of model parameters which may not be accurate and have to be estimated subject to heterogeneous uncertain factors. We have developed a framework which considers the uncertainty of design-time parameter estimates, and optimizes embedded system architectures for robust quality goals. The framework empowers conventional architecture optimization approaches with modeling and tool support for architecture description, model evaluation and architecture optimization on the face of uncertainty."

The existence of traceability along these artifacts is essential, since it allows to monitor the product development from the initial requirements to the final code. However, traceability is established and maintained mostly manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. A further crucial problem is the assurance of the validity of the trace links, that is, the linked elements are indeed related to each other. In this paper we present a semiautomatic approach to create, check, and update trace links between artifacts along an automotive development process."

In this paper we propose a case study approach with the goal to understand how liability concerns in this setting impact software development in industry. The approach takes into account that software development is embedded into a complex socio-technical context involving stakeholders from technical, managerial and legal backgrounds. We present first results of our case study from a questionnaire involving six companies that develop software-intensive, safety-critical systems in the vehicular and avionics domains. The results of the questionnaire shed light on current industrial practices and concerns. The results indicate that liability seems indeed a concern and that a more in-depth analysis of this topic would be desirable to better understand the strategies that are used by industry to address liability risks."

Many viruses on PC platforms migrated to embedded device have brought new threats to the security of the embedded platform. ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) attack is one of them. At the same time, traditional protective measures on PC platform tend to lose effect in embedded devices due to differences among platforms and architectures which bring significant challenges to virus protection on embedded devices. Defending ROP attack confronts the same problem. Existing protective methods against ROP attack on PC rarely work well on an embedded platform. This paper presents a protective algorithm against ROP virus on the embedded ARM platform. Furthermore, we develop a Valgrind tool to implement this algorithm with dynamic binary instrumentation technology which can effectively prevent the ROP attack and its variants on the ARM platform."

  "Abstract": "Maintenance of embedded software systems is faced with multiple challenges, including the exploration and analysis of the actual system's runtime behavior. As a fundamental technique, tracing can be used to capture data about runtime behavior as a whole, and represents one of the few methods to observe and record data about embedded systems within their production environments. \\n\\nIn this paper we present a software-based, function-boundary tracing approach for embedded software systems. It uses static binary instrumentation, which implies only lightweight memory and performance overheads. To further reduce these overheads, instrumentation can be configured per trace, i.e., activated only for a specified group of functions without having to recompile the system. The technique can be characterized by its robust implementation and its versatile usage. It is complemented by a visualization framework that allows for analysis and exploration of a system's runtime behavior, e.g., to examine thread interaction. To show the technique's applicability, we conclude with a case study that has been applied to an industrial embedded software system."

To avoid considering healthcare workflows in isolation, we investigate the usage of our CSP dialect for formally modeling workflows alongside the instruction model of the openEHR specification set, which is a general, maintainable, and interoperable approach to electronic health records. Hence, we present a CSP model for openEHR instructions, which allows timed reasoning, and also integrates a basic notion of data and undefinedness. We show that this CSP dialect is suited to verify important properties of healthcare workflows, like workflow consistency, checking against timed specifications, and resource scheduling."

  "Abstract": "Existing regulatory agency guidance documents and process standards for medical devices (i.e., IEC 62304) generally consider medical devices to be stand-alone monolithic systems. The format and content of a system requirements document largely follows that of conventional embedded safety- critical systems. However, a vision is emerging of a new paradigm of medical system based on the notion of a medical application platform (MAP). A MAP is a safety- and security- critical real-time computing platform for (a) integrating heterogeneous devices, medical IT systems, and information displays via a communication infrastructure and (b) hosting application programs (i.e., apps) that provide medical utility via the ability to both acquire information from and update/control integrated devices, IT systems, and displays. To ensure a regulatory pathway for MAPs, it is necessary to adapt traditional development processes and artifacts to the specific characteristics of MAP architectures and constituent components. In this paper, we provide an initial proposal for developing and formatting requirements for MAP apps. For illustration, we consider an app that implements two \"smart alarms\" for pulse oximetry monitoring in a clinical context."

  "Abstract": "A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is composed of distributed sensors with limited processing capabilities and energy restrictions. These unique attributes pose new chal- lenges amongst which prolonging the WSN lifetime is one of the most important. Challenges are often tackled by a code- and-fix process that relies on low-level hardware and software information. \\n\\nRecently, the need of abstracting an implementation view into an architectural design is getting more realized. A clear separation of concerns is needed since hardware and software aspects are locked and tied down to specific types of nodes, hampering the possibility of reuse across projects and organiza- tions. This means that exploiting the right level of abstraction, and keeping explicit (and separated) software and hardware architectural details will surely ease developers’ job. \\n\\nIn this paper we propose a modeling framework that allows developers to model separately the software architecture of the WSN, the low-level hardware specification of the WSN nodes and the physical environment where nodes are deployed in. The framework can use these models to generate executable code for analysis purposes. In this paper we focus on energy consumption analysis."

We choose Erlang due to the functional high-level programming model and the native support for concurrency and distributed programming. Both are assets when developing applications as well as system-level functionality in our target domain. Our design enriches the Erlang framework with a custom library for programming sensing/actuation distributed systems along with a dedicated run-time support, while we wipe off unnecessary language and run-time features. We couple the resulting platform with ad-hoc tools for simulation and testing, supporting developers throughout the development cycle. We assess our solution by implementing three sensor network distributed protocols. A comparison with traditional sensor network programming platforms demonstrates the advantages in terms of terseness of code, readability, and maintainability."

The semantics of policies is formalised in terms of traces augmented with information concerning the constraints under which traces are executed. These traces are composed according to the network topology and subsequently analysed using the mCRL2 model- checking tool. The analysis allows for the detection of semantical inconsistencies that may lead to dangerous or unwanted behaviour of the application based on the policy configuration. An analysis of policies in a real-world system is provided, showing how to verify security and resource usage properties."

  "Abstract": "Model-driven development (MDD) facilitates the development of wireless sensor network (WSN) applications because MDD can deal with models at the abstraction level to the concrete level. In the MDD for WSN applications, the developers model the dataflow at the abstract level and model the designs of a communication and task assignment at the concrete level. In our previous work we proposed a MDD process for WSN applications with three domain specific languages (DSLs). However, we did not sufficiently evaluate the description capabilities of our DSLs. For that reason, we report case studies on real-world applications to prove the feasibility of our approach. Our DSL can be used to describe both the application logic and design decisions concerning the quality of data, which are adopted in target applications. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DSLs at multiple abstraction levels."

  "Abstract": "Software development in wireless sensor networks has traditionally focused on stand-alone applications statically linked with the operating system code, and relying on fixed models for scheduling, synchronization, and resource allocation. Middleware services and network protocols, are usually considered to be part of the operating system. As the number of available WSN platforms and operating systems grows, and the emergence of cyber-physical systems results in the creation of networks of hetrogeneous devices (sensor nodes, microcontrollers, mobile devices, etc.), portability and interoperation emerge as major considerations in the software development process. We propose breaking the tight integration between middleware services and the operating system. We demonstrate how adopting a service-oriented computing approach to WSN middleware services improves portability and enables the creation of heterogeneous sensor networks and cyber-physical systems. The adoption of a service-oriented architecture does not necessarily translate into a significant loss of performance. An extremely light-weight and flexible method for local and remote service interaction is proposed."

  "Abstract": "Developing and deploying a pervasive space is a multi-disciplined process where knowledge from various domains intersects. How can individual roles efficiently contribute their expertise and smoothly integrate their work to create a pervasive space? How does system design and architecture enable effective decoupling of these roles? Based on our own experience in building several pervasive systems including the Gator Tech Smart House (GTSH), this paper discusses a collaboration model that allows multiple roles, working together, to design, develop, and maintain pervasive systems in physical spaces such as homes and buildings. The paper first introduces each role in the model with its designated resources and responsibilities. It then explains the collaboration model and shows how it can be applied in real-world deployments. This paper does not claim to provide an ultimate solution to a well-defined problem. Rather, it attempts to define an increasingly important problem and provides an installment of thoughts toward solutions. We hope the paper raises awareness to the importance of this subject and leads to a productive discussion during and following the workshop."

It supports sensor data collection, actuator control, real-time alerts based on sensor values, and querying measurement and alert history. Compared to the related work, WSN OpenAPI allows efficient machine-to-machine (M2M) communications with low complexity message formats and avoiding extensive queries with publish/subscribe paradigm."

  "Abstract": "The acquisition and distribution of multimedia content, such as still images, audio and video streams, are the new frontier of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Scalar data WSNs commonly rely on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard that defines suitable physical and medium access control layers, whereas wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs) need advanced architectures able to maintain a predetermined level of quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we analyze the potential of the combination of IPv4 and the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, if employed in the innovative VISION's architecture for WMSNs, designed to support real-time video streaming. We implement IPv4 at the network (NWK) layer, because it is the most suitable protocol to guarantee the interoperability among heterogeneous networks, hence it easily allows the remote access to the WMSN's content. Suitable protocols for network management will provide the relevant performance parameters to the QoS engine of the VISION's architecture that will enable the full adaptability of nodes to the context. Since the main QoS requirements for real time video streaming are the maximum tolerable end-to-end delay and packet loss, our performance evaluation focuses on the analysis of latency and transmitted frames, in the presence of different traffic sources. We also measure the power consumption of WMSN's nodes for the video streaming service."

  "Abstract": "A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a versatile sensing system whose hardware resources are scarce and have to be carefully used and hence adapted to face with their context and resources changing. Moreover, WSN could be used in unreachable or dangerous places, hence their adaptation should be remotely managed. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach able to generate agents governing the sensor node in a WSN. The generation is automatic and the obtained agents are sent to the sensor nodes and executed over a mobile agents based middleware (i.e. a virtual machine). In this way, the sensor node logics can be automatically adapted without experiencing (from the user or the remaining system) service interruption. The approach will be developed in the VISION infrastructure to bridge the QoS management and the sensor nodes to guarantee best quality of service in case of context and resource changes."

  "Abstract": "In this paper, the OPC UA is introduced as a key technology for realizing a variety of Smart Grid use cases enabling relevant tasks of automation and control. OPC UA is the successor of the established Classic OPC specification and state of the art regarding information exchange in the industrial automation branch. One of its key improvements over the Classic OPC is that the area of application is no longer restricted to industrial automation but OPC UA can be applied almost in every domain facing challenges in automated control. This improvement stems from a more generic and object-oriented approach. For the adoption of OPC UA to Smart Grids, two of the most important data models -- the Common Information Model (CIM) and the IEC 61850 -- have been identified to be integrated into OPC UA communication. In this contribution, basic OPC UA features and functionalities (information modeling, communication services, and information security) are introduced and discussed in the context of Smart Grids."

We base our discussion on a structured literature review and on an ongoing case study in a software company. Future studies are needed on certain characteristics of Smart Grid software applications that affect their defect profile. For this purpose, not only the software development companies but also the grid utilities should be studied."

  "Abstract": "Smart distribution networks shall improve the efficiency and reliability of power distribution by intelligently managing the available power and requested load. Such intelligent power networks pose challenges for information and communication technology (ICT). Their design requires a holistic assessment of traditional power system topology and ICT architecture. \\n\\nExisting analysis approaches focus on analyzing the power networks components separately. For example, communication simulation provides failure data for communication links, while power analysis makes predictions about the stability of the traditional power grid. However, these insights are not combined to provide a basis for design decisions for future smart distribution networks. \\n\\nIn this paper, we describe a common model-driven analysis framework for smart distribution networks based on the Common Information Model (CIM). This framework provides scalable analysis of large smart distribution networks by supporting analyses on different levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we apply our framework to holistic survivability analysis. We map the CIM on a survivability model to enable assessing design options with respect to the achieved survivability improvement. \\n\\nWe demonstrate our approach by applying the mapping transformation in a case study based on a real distribution circuit. We conclude by evaluating the survivability impact of three investment options."

  "Abstract": "The daily peaks and valleys in energy demand create inefficiencies and expense in the operation of the electricity grid. Valley periods force utilities to curtail renewable energy sources such as wind as their unpredictable nature makes it difficult to maintain line frequency across the network within target bounds. Peak periods require additional generators that remain dormant during other periods. Smoothing this demand cycle is one of the fundamental challenges of the Smart Grid, requiring flexibility and coordination between actors throughout the Grid. This paper describes the Smart Grid as a multi-layered system and proposes a cross-layered dynamic adaptation approach to facilitate this flexibility and coordination. This method uses a hierarchical taxonomy to identify appropriate adaptation actions in response to identified mismatches, supported by a run-time predictive statistical framework to predict mismatches, enabling timely adaptations to be triggered."

  "Abstract": "Understanding user requirements and technological challenges for Smart Grid is important to deliver competitive and visionary products and services, and thus to shape the direction of research and development. Since Smart Grid is still in the formation stage with many stakeholders, we should quickly develop consensual and pragmatic international standards and strategies. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of proposed Smart Grid requirements, formulated as 16 generic use-cases by an EU working group, and to identify attitudes, products, services and future technologies. Subsequently, we want to provide information on identified gaps between technologies, functionalities and stakeholders` views, and future direction. We have designed and carried out an initial industrial survey in Norway on how generic use-cases for Smart Grid activities are interpreted by 6 representative stakeholders in the Norwegian energy sector. To achieve this goal, we designed a survey with metrics built on and around these use-cases. Our results showed that the users’ work experience and views on the functionality expressed in the use-cases revealed a gap in focus and culture. Also, there was no agreement on what the term \"Smart Grid\" stood for. In addition, the relevance of Smart Grid functionalities is shown to vary over time and with different stakeholders. The pre-study results indicated that there is potential for using information from future data collected from over 270 actors to bridge gaps and focus on Smart Grid research and development."

Smart Grid Interoperability Maturity Model is used to measure the current status of automation in the areas like transmission, distribution and demand side resources. The Smart Grid Investment Model is used in calculating different smart grid investments, along with their strategies. Smart Grid Maturity model is used in planning of utilities in smart grid transformation; prioritize the tasks and measuring their progress at every stage.

This paper discusses the need for adaptive security and privacy in smart grids by presenting some motivating scenarios. We then outline some research issues that arise in engineering adaptive security. We particularly scrutinize published reports by NIST on smart grid security and privacy as the basis for our discussions."

  "Abstract": "Code search has always been essential to software development; it is the cornerstone of activities such as program comprehension and maintenance. Traditionally, code search required learning of complex query languages with very steep learning curves. In contrast, programming environments for mobile devices targeting novice programmers are becoming popular and code search is becoming increasingly important. Yet, dedicated code query languages present a learning barrier for novice programmers. In this paper we consider search-by-example as a way of dealing with this problem. Given a query code snippet, we find all similar snippets in the codebase and present them to the user. This problem is a special instance of the clone detection problem, and, by using relevant techniques, we can perform precise code search with little to no configuration and completely agnostic of code formatting, variable renamings, etc. These properties make search-by-example very easy to use by inexperienced programmers. We built a prototype of our approach in TouchDevelop, a novel mobile app development environment for Windows Phone. We will use it as a testing ground for future evaluation."

The query-by-example search conveys the user need in form of a model or pattern specified in a coarse way. Our approach incorporates analysis and indexing of models using textual information retrieval techniques, which exploit the knowledge of the metamodel the models conform to. This allows us to explore different segmentation granularities on models and different indexing techniques ranging from simple bag of words, to index structures which integrate metamodel information. We detail the proposed theoretical framework, the implementation of the method upon open-source architectures, and we discuss the results of our experiments upon a public dataset of UML models."

The results show that differential labeling outperforms cluster-internal labeling, and that hybrid method does not necessarily lead to the labels best matching human judgment.

  "Abstract": "Research on software reuse over the last decade has removed a lot of obstacles to its practical adoption. However, despite the claims in the software reuse literature of 1990's there are still some fundamental research challenges to be addressed, especially the problem of delivering 'good' (i.e. high quality) search results with high precision and semantic recall. In terms of precision, one of the most promising approach to have emerged in recent years is test-driven search which only includes components in the result set that actually match a developer’s behavioral requirements as defined by a test case. However, the test-driven search prototypes available today currently have a low \"semantic recall\" because they are unable to find semantically matching components which have the wrong syntactic interface. In this paper we describe an automatic adaptation engine that alleviates this problem by automatically creating adapters to allow semantically mismatching components to be tested by test-driven search engines, thus significantly enhancing their semantic recall."

Recent research found that the learning materials themselves are often inadequate. developers struggle to find answers beyond simple usage scenarios.

In this paper, we report on design implications of tools for API learning, grounded in the reality of the professional developers themselves. The reoccurring themes in the participants' feedback were trustworthiness, confidentiality, information overload and the need for code examples as first-class documentation artifacts."

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach that ranks recommended programs by taking their ``freshness'' count into account. This short paper discusses the background of the problem, and illustrates the proposed algorithm."

  "Abstract": "In this paper we present our experiences from a decade of plug-in development in the jABC framework, that is characterized by rigorous application of {\\em simplicity principles} in two dimensions. First, the {\\em scope} of the plug-in development is clearly defined. The jABC readily provides a sophisticated graphical user interface, which has been tailored to working with all kinds of directed graphs. Within this scope, plug-in development can deliberately focus on the actual functionality, like providing semantics to graphs, without having to deal with tedious but semantically irrelevant issues like user interfaces. Second, {\\em plug-in functionality} can be itself conveniently modeled as a workflow within the jABC. We illustrate our approach by means of two mature plug-ins. Genesys, a plug-in that adds arbitrary code generator functionality to the jABC, and PROPHETS, a plug-in that eases user-level definition of workflows by completing model sketches by means of synthesis capabilities, so that they become complete and executable. We summarize our experience so far and derive general design principles for ''lightweight plug-in development'', that we are going to realize in the next generation of the jABC, which will be implemented itself as a collection of Eclipse plug-ins."

  "Abstract": "Current version control systems are not built to be systematically analyzed. They have greatly evolved since their first appearance, but their focus has always been towards supporting developers in forward engineering activities. Supporting the analysis of the development history has so far been neglected. A plethora of third party applications have been built to fill this gap. To extract the data needed, they use interfaces that were not built for that. Drawing from our experience in mining and analyzing version control repositories, we propose an architectural blueprint for a plug-in based version control system in which analyses can be directly plugged into it in a flexible and lightweight way, to support both developers and analysts. We show the potential of this approach in three usage scenarios and we also give some examples for these analysis plug-ins."

  "Abstract": "The need to support different stages of a software system's life-cycle in a software development environment has resulted in the emergence of plug-ins that can monitor and adapt the resulting system's run-time environment. In several recent self-adaptive systems, the existence of these plug-ins has resulted in the integration of the development and run-time environments. We introduce a novel reference architecture that captures the architectures of disparate development environments-from those, such as traditional development environments, that have no run-time plug-ins, to the ones, such as the recently emerging development environments, that are fully integrated with the run-time environments. This reference architecture aids the study and understanding of development environments. More importantly, adherence to the architecture improves the run-time availability of certain critical system facilities while reducing the resource consumption of the integrated development and run-time environments."

  "Abstract": "XML has quickly become a mainstream language in software development. Not only is it used for message and document interchange, it is also used to define application logic and interfaces. However, modern general purpose integrated development environments have rather limited support for XML development. The wide variety of XML based languages makes it a challenge to build tools for comprehensive support of XML development. In this paper, we present a library exposed as an add-in for Microsoft Visual Studio and a command line tool to improve the experience of editing XML files by providing access to subscribable service-based pluggable helper tools. The tools offer developers new means to check their XML against good and bad practices and possibly even automatically fix errors in XML or improve the files conformance with development guidelines."

  "Abstract": "Development environments have put quite some effort into being open platforms, however rewriting our own tools as plug-ins we found that while host platform and other plug-ins are open for addition of feature they are typically closed to accessing data. We report from our own experience rewriting the Codemap tool as an Eclipse plug-in as well as from maintaining the Moose platform and argue why IDEs need to adopt an Open Data paradigm to become valuable targets for development of novel tools. We propose that data created by plug-ins need to default to being openly shared with other plug-ins through uniform data structures. Adding appropriate meta-information to this setup will allow other plug-ins to even make use of this data in unanticipated ways. We further argue that opening up data should not stop at the development platform but that programing languages and even virtual machines should also open up their internal data for the greater benefit of development tool and API designers."

TacoPlug uses and extends TACO to provide a better debugging experience. TacoPlug interface allows the user to verify an annotated software using the TACO verifier . If TACO finds a violation to the specification, TacoPlug presents it in terms of the annotated source code. TacoPlug features several views of the error trace to facilitate fault understanding. It resembles any software debugger, but the debugging occurs statically without executing the program. We show the usability of our tool by means of a motivational example taken from a real-life software error."

In this paper, we report on our experience of building and integrating the CodeContract tool set into an existing programming environment. The CodeContract tools enable 1) authoring of contracts (preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants), 2) instrumenting contract checks into code, 3) statically checking code against contracts, and 4) visualizing contracts and results. We identify three characteristics of our integration that allowed us to reuse existing compilers and IDEs, increase the reach of our tools to multiple languages and target platforms, and maintain the tools over three consecutive versions of C# and Visual Studio with little effort. These principles are 1) use source embedding for new language features, 2) use target analysis and rewriting, and 3) use generic plug-ins to isolate tools from the IDE."

  "Abstract": "Tools are an essential part of every software engineering project. But the number of tools that are used in all phases of the software development life-cycle and their complexity is growing continually. Consequently, the setup and maintenance of current tool chains and development environments requires much effort and consumes a lot of time. One approach to counter this, is to employ web-based systems for development tasks, because centralized systems simplify the administration and the deployment of new features. But desktop IDEs play an important role in software development projects today, and will not be replaced entirely by web-based environments in the near future. Therefore, supporting a mixture of hosted tools and tools integrated into desktop IDEs is a sensible approach. \\n\\nIn this paper, we present the SSELab, a framework for web-based project portals that attempts to migrate more software development tools from desktop to server environments, but still allows their integration into modern desktop IDEs. It supports the deployment of tools as hosted services using plug-in systems on the server-side. Additionally, it provides access to these tools by a set of clients that can be used in different contexts, either from the command line, from within IDEs such as Eclipse, or from web pages. In the paper, we discuss the architecture and the extensibility of the SSELab framework. Furthermore, we share our experiences with creating an instance of the framework and integrating various tools for our own software development projects."

Many traditional safety analysis techniques where developed decades ago and thus cannot cope with the complexity of modern systems. Model based analysis techniques where developed to deal with the complexity of software-intensive systems. However, due to the lack of tool support these techniques are currently limited to highly skilled experts. Thus model-based analysis is rarely used by system engineers. \\n\\nBased on the safety analysis modeling language (SAML) framework we propose the S³E, which integrates a complete safety analysis environment into the eclipse platform. S³E covers the whole safety analysis work flow. This implies a powerful editor for model creation, a seamless integration of model-analysis tools and presentation as well as evaluation of the analysis results into one environment. In this paper we present the current state of S³E and first experiences with the eclipse plug-in development."

This paper introduces Xcel2RDF, an MS Excel plug-in to support the triplification of spreadsheets, which minimizes the learning curve, as it is integrated into a widely used spreadsheet software tool. The plug-in is user-friendly, does not depend on the installation of additional software and does not require the user to leave his familiar environment, thereby avoiding problems reported as the major drawbacks of existing spreadsheet to RDF conversion tools. Finally, as a proof of concept, the paper illustrates how to use the tool to triplify statistical data."

  "Abstract": "Over the years, many software engineering activities have relied on the automated support afforded by tools. In order to maximize the benefits provided by tools, they are often retrofitted to pre-existing development environments that enable them to capitalize on facilities provided by compilers, debuggers, and profilers. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), for instance, comprise a myriad of tightly-knit tools (i.e., plugins) designed to boost programmer productivity. Due to the advantages that such integrated environments have brought to the mainstream, they have become a de facto standard to implement complex software systems. Eclipse is one of the most widely used contemporary IDEs. In order to integrate a set of mainstream C/C++ development tools along with several in-house IBM tools, we have used Eclipse a as basis to bring together a SDK comprising the necessary tools to assist in the development and analysis of C/C++ programs for Power Architecture, namely, the IBM Software Development Kit for PowerLinux. In this paper, we describe the approach we used to port such tools into plugins, the main technical hurdles we ran into during the porting, the workarounds we used to deal with such issues, and some quirks of the target platform (i.e., Power machines)."

The injected code, written in JavaScript, records user events as well as client-side dynamic content requests (e.g. via Ajax or Jsonp) and their responses. Recorded events and responses are then sent to a remote database via HTTP POST. Web page developers can query the saved client data, again using Rumadai seamlessly from Visual Studio, to replay all or a subset of events on a browser."

A catalog of usability patterns is used to describe proven and reusable solutions and to support software engineers in selecting appropriate usability features for a system. To allow for a systematic consideration, usability features are specified in a use case-based software requirements specification using semiformal specification templates. The resulting extended specification defines where and how usability features shall be integrated in the system, thus facilitating subsequent development activities (e. g. software architecture design, implementation, and test)."

  "Abstract": "Product development processes and best practices have come a long way in the last decade through continuous evolutions of new lifecycle and process models. Development models such as the waterfall model, spiral model, rational unified process, agile and many others have looked at efficiency of the development processes. These approaches have helped practitioners improve immensely on the efficiency and efficacy of the product development processes. However, product quality needs to be measured by parameters that go beyond the traditional criteria like performance, reliability, reusability etc. A product that has any interaction with the end user also needs to meet a fundamental requirement of being \"user friendly\". Development models such as JAD (Joint Application Development) have focused on making products user friendly. Apart from achieving the technical soundness in a product, the success of the product also largely depends on how well the product addresses the primary requirements of the user such as desirability, relevance and usability. Not meeting these requirements leads to bad user experience, which, in turn can actually lead to failure of the product. This paper discusses some of the misconceptions and myths that exist in the industry regarding Requirements Engineering (RE) and User Experience Design (UXD), and how user needs typically slip through the cracks under the name of \"non-functional requirements\". The paper highlights the need for RE and UXD focus during the overall product development life cycle. In the concluding section an integrated framework for RE and UXD in the PLM process is presented."

Different qualitative research methods are used to elicit and analyze usability issues. This paper describes first attempts on how acceptance of the FSTP method and software may be enhanced by a user-centered approach comprising. identifying learnability issues of the method, creating training accordingly, and uncovering usability issues of the existing prototype. The analysis of facts for a dispute is a creative and lengthy process that requires a lot of different skills (also with respect to regional specificities in patent law).

Hence, conducting realistic experimentation with professional users that reflect real life tasks is challenging. Experimentation with toy examples and tasks suffers from significant threats to external validity. Consequently, results from such experiments fail to gain confidence or mitigate risks, a prerequisite for industrial adoption. This paper presents two empirical studies conducted to evaluate a model-oriented programming language called Umple; a grounded theory study and a controlled experiment of comprehension. Evaluations of model-oriented programming is particularly challenging. First, there is a need to provide for highly sophisticated development environments for realistic evaluation. Second, the scarcity of experienced users poses additional challenges. In this paper we discuss our experiences, lessons learned, and future considerations in the evaluation of a research prototype tool."

  "Abstract": "The field of automated debugging, which is concerned with the automation of identifying and correcting a failure’s root cause, has made tremendous advancements in the past. However, some of the reported progress may be due to unrealistic assumptions that underlie the evaluation of automated debugging tools. These unrealistic assumptions concern the work process of developers and their ability to detect faulty code without explanatory context, as well as the size and arrangement of fixes. Instead of trying to locate the fault, we propose to help the developer understand it, thus enabling her to decide which fix she deems most appropriate. This would entail the need to employ a completely different evaluation scheme that bases on feedback from actual users of the tools in realistic usage scenarios. With this paper we propose the details for a first such user study."

Live sequence charts (LSC) is a visual formalism that implements the approach of behavioral programming. The approach attempts to liberate programming by allowing the user to program the behavior of reactive systems by scenarios. We would like to evaluate the approach and seek the naturalness of the best interface for creating the visual artifact of LSCs. Several such interfaces, among which is a novel interactive natural language (NL) interface, exist. Initial testing indicates that the LSCs' NL interface may be preferred by programmers to procedural programming and that in certain tasks LSCs may be a viable and more natural alternative to conventional programming. Many challenges exist in trying to prove the intuitive and natural nature of a new programming paradigm, which differs from others not only in syntax but in many other respects. We describe these challenges in this proposal."

The question, that has not yet been asked by science, is. Are we still learning something from these mistakes, besides the knowledge, that such mistakes will be corrected for us? In the following we will propose an experimental setup, that aims to answer this question."

  "Abstract": "Spreadsheets are widely recognized as popular programming systems with a huge number of spreadsheets being created every day. Also, spreadsheets are often used in the decision processes of profit-oriented companies. While this illustrates their practical importance, studies have shown that up to 90% of real-world spreadsheets contain errors. \\n\\nIn order to improve the productivity of spreadsheet end-users, the software engineering community has proposed to employ model-driven approaches to spreadsheet development. \\n\\nIn this paper we describe the evaluation of a bidirectional model-driven spreadsheet environment. In this environment, models and data instances are kept in conformity, even after an update on any of these artifacts. We describe the issues of an empirical study we plan to conduct, based on our previous experience with end-user studies. Our goal is to assess if this model-driven spreadsheet development framework does in fact contribute to improve the productivity of spreadsheet users."

However, little qualitative research has been done on the actual use of bug tracking systems, bug triage, and resolution processes. We are planning to conduct a qualitative study to understand the dynamics of bug triage and fixing process, as well as bug reassignments and reopens. We will study interviews conducted with Mozilla Core and Firefox developers to get insights into the primary obstacles developers face during the bug fixing process. Is the triage process flawed? Does bug review slow things down? Does approval takes too long? We will also categorize the main reasons for bug reassignments and reopens. We will then combine results with a quantitative study of Firefox bug reports, focusing on factors related to bug report edits and number of people involved in handling the bug."

  "Abstract": "In co-located collaborative software development activities like pair programming, side-by-side programming, code reviews or code walkthroughs, the individuals automatically gain a fine granular mutual understanding of where in the shared workspace the other participants are, what they are doing and what their levels of interest are. These points of so called awareness information are critical for an efficient and smooth collaboration but cannot be obtained via the natural mechanisms in virtual teams. Application sharing and groupware for collaborative editing are widely used for collaborative tasks in distributed software development but considered from the awareness and flexibility aspect they are far off the co-located setting. To better support virtual team collaboration by improving tools for distributed software development it is neccesary to evaluate awareness and its impacts to certain collaborative situations. Awareness itself is an invisible phenomenon and due to its intangible nature cannot be easily observed or measured. Thus we recorded virtual teams using Saros, a groupware for distributed collaborative party programming, respectively VNC and now analyse these videos using the grounded theory methodology. This approach for evaluating awareness leads to various problems concerning the recording setup and time exposure for analysis."

Some modifications are harder to understand than others; e.g., an explicit method call is usually easy to trace in the source code, while a reflective method call may perplex both developers and analysis tools. Our tool, the Inconsistency Inspector, collects static and dynamic call graphs of systems and composes them to help developers more systematically address the static and dynamic implications of a change to a system. \\n\\nWe have quantitatively validated the Inconsistency Inspector and have convinced ourselves that it can expose both interesting and surprising facets of a system's evolution. An initial case study with an industrial organization showed promise leading to the Inconsistency Inspector being installed at the organization for the past several months in preparation for a more in depth analysis. \\n\\nIn July 2012 we will have the opportunity to examine 8~months of industrial data, enabling us to perform an in-depth longitudinal evaluation of how their system has evolved and whether the Inconsistency Inspector can expose surprising and helpful facts for the industrial team. At the USER workshop, we hope to gather opinions about evaluation options for validating the industrial utility of our approach and the complex longitudinal data we have collected."

  "Affiliations": ["North Carolina State University, USA", "IBM Research, India"],
  "Abstract": "The exception-handling mechanism has been widely adopted to deal with exception conditions that may arise during program executions. To produce high-quality programs, developers are expected to handle these exception conditions and take necessary recovery or resource-releasing actions. Failing to handle these exception conditions can lead to not only performance degradation, but also critical issues. Developers can write formal specifications to capture expected exception-handling behavior, and then apply tools to automatically analyze program code for detecting specification violations. However, in practice, developers rarely write formal specifications. To address this issue, mining techniques have been used to mine common exception-handling behavior out of program code. In this paper, we discuss challenges and achievements in precisely specifying and mining formal exception-handling specifications, as tackled by our previous work. Our key insight is that expected exception-handling behavior may be 'conditional' or may need to accommodate 'exceptional' cases."

First, passive and active exception assertions dynamically check if the reason for an exception raise matches with the purpose of a matching handler. A passive assertion is a check when an exception propagates out of a block it guards. The active form adds probabilistically injection of exceptions to provide more comprehensive testing. Second, runtime exception information is logged for dynamic query to check current handling status and provide a history of exceptional events."

  "Abstract": "Multi-core processors are present in everyone’s daily life. Consequently, concurrent programming has re-emerged as a pressing concern for everyone interested in exploring all the potential computational power in these machines. But, the emergence of new concurrency models and programming languages also brings new challenges in terms of how one can deal with abnormal occurrences, much due to the heterogenous parallel control flow. Unexpectedly, sequential Exception Handling models remain as the most used tool for robustness, even in the most recent concurrent programming languages. Though, the appearance of more complex models, such as programming languages with implicit concurrency, might pose a challenge too big for these sequential mechanisms. In this article we will provide evidences why such models are not generally suited to deal with faults in programs with implicit concurrency and, in the light of more recent advances in concurrent Exception Handling, we will discuss the attributes of a model for addressing this problem."

  "Abstract": "A programming language is network-transparent if the same program code executes with the same results, whether it is run in a centralized or distributed setting, provided there is no partial failure. The Erlang programming language is network-transparent and handle failures by message passing. We propose in this paper a generalization of the Erlang failure handling model which can be used for more expressive network-transparent languages. \\n\\nThe new design introduces two concepts. entity fault states and fault streams. The failure of an entity is modeled in the system as a language entity, and is visible to the programmer via its corresponding fault stream. We also describe an implementation in Mozart 1.4.0. Evaluation shows that this model incurs a slight overhead in performance, but yields much more modular program code."

Such a decomposition requires a programming language that supports compositions matching those in the problem domain. However, current programming languages only offer a restricted set of control-flow related composition mechanisms, such as method invocation and exception handling. This limits developers in choosing the desired decomposition. \\n\\nPreviously, we showed that continuations are suitable for implementing various control-flow compositions. However, composing and refining these implementations requires new language features. In this paper, we outline requirements for control-flow composition and show how exception handling can be implemented using continuations, scopes and bindings."

  "Abstract": "The context-awareness is a central aspect in the design of pervasive systems, characterizing their ability to adapt its structure and behavior. The context-aware exception handling (CAEH) is an existing approach employed to design exception handling in pervasive systems. In this approach, the context is used to define, detect, propagate, and handle exceptions. CAEH is a complex and error prone activity, needing designers' insights and domain expertise to identify and characterize contextual exceptions. However, despite the existence of formal methods to analyze the adaptive behavior of pervasive systems, such methods lack specific support to specify the CAEH behavior. In this paper, we propose a formal model to reason about the CAEH behavior. It comprises an extension of the Kripke Structure to model the context evolution of a pervasive system and a transformation function that derivates the CAEH control flow from that proposed structure."

  "Abstract": "Java Card is a version of Java developed to run on devices with severe storage and processing restrictions. The applets that run on these devices are frequently intended for use in critical, highly distributed, mobile conditions. This requires runtime verification approach based on Design by Contract to improve the safety of Java Card applications. However handling contract violation in Java Card applications is challenging due to their communication structure and platform restrictions. Additionally the Java Card exception handling mechanism requires that developers understand the source of an exception, the place where it is handled, and everything in between. As system development evolves, exceptional control flows become less well-understood, with negative consequences for the program maintainability and robustness. In this paper, we claim that such problem can be addressed by implementing an innovative exception handling model which provides abstractions to explicitly describe global views of exceptional control flows."

The example process is specified in the Little-JIL process definition language.

In particular, Connector-VP is used to support choices of different handlers depending on the set of selected features. Thus it realizes the binding between the normal behaviour and the selected exception handler."

  "Abstract": "Metrics measurement for cost estimation in model-driven engineering (MDE) is complex because of number of different artifacts that can potentially be generated. The complexity arises as auto-generated code, manually added code, and non-code artifacts must be sized separately for their contribution to overall effort. In this paper, we address measurement of a special kind of code artifacts called metadata-based aspect-oriented code. Our MDE toolset delivers large database-centric business-critical enterprise applications. We cater to special needs of enterprises by providing support for customization along three concerns, namely design strategies, architecture, and technology platforms (&lt;d, a, t&gt;) in customer-specific applications. Code that is generated for these customizations is conditional in nature, in the sense that model-to-text transformation takes place differently based on choices along these concerns. In our recent efforts to apply Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) II to our MDE practices, we discovered that while the measurement of the rest of code and non-code artifacts can be easily automated, product-line-like nature of code generation for specifics of &lt;d, a, t&gt; requires special treatment. Our contribution is the use of feature models to capture variations in these dimensions and their mapping to code size estimates. Our initial implementation suggests that this approach scales well considering the size of our applications and takes a step forward in providing complete cost estimation for MDE applications using COCOMO II."

  "Abstract": "In the literature we can identify two main approaches for sizing model-driven Web applications. one based on design measures and another based on functional measures. Design measures take into account the modeling primitives characterizing the models of the specific model-driven approach. On the other hand, the functional measures are obtained by applying functional size measurement procedures specifically conceived to map the modeling primitives of the model-driven approach into concepts of a functional size measurement method. In this paper, we focus our attention on the Object-Oriented Hypermedia (OO-H) method, a model-driven approach to design and develop Web applications. We report on the results of an empirical study carried out to compare the ability of some design measures and OO-HFP (a model-driven functional size measurement procedure) to predict the development effort of Web applications. To this aim, we exploited a dataset with 31 Web projects developed using OO-H. The analysis highlighted that each design measure was positively correlated with the Web application development effort. However, the best estimation model obtained by exploiting the Manual Stepwise Regression employed only the measure Internal Links (IL). Furthermore, the study highlighted that the estimates obtained with the IL based prediction model were significantly better than those achieved using the OO-HFP based prediction model. These results seem to confirm previous investigations suggesting that Function Point Analysis can fail to capture some specific features of Web applications."

  "Abstract": "Software maintenance is an important problem because software is an evolving complex system. To make software maintenance viable, it is important to know the real nature of the systems we have to deal with. Little House is a model that provides a macroscopic view of software systems. According to Little House, a software system can be modeled as a graph with five components. This model is intended to be an approach to improve the understanding and the analysis of software structures. However, to achieve this aim, it is necessary to determine its characteristics and its implications. This paper presents the results of an empirical study aiming to characterize software evolution by means of Little House and software metrics. We analyzed several versions of 13 open source software systems, which have been developed over nearly 10 years. The results of the study show that there are two main components of Little House which suffer substantial degradation as the software system evolves. This finding indicates that those components should be carefully taken in consideration when maintenance tasks are performed in the system."

Several techniques have been designed in order to face this issue, among them Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA).

Ontologies have been proposed as a way to formalize the SW-FMEA process and to give precise semantics to the involved concepts and data. We present a framework, based on an ontological model, which, beyond other capabilities, supports the collection of SW metrics enabling automatic identification of SW components not attaining the required level of assurance."

  "Abstract": "Software evolution, and particularly its growth, has been mainly studied at the file (also sometimes referred as module) level. In this paper we propose to move from the physical towards a level that includes semantic information by using functions or methods for measuring the evolution of a software system. We point out that use of functions-based metrics has many advantages over the use of files or lines of code. We demonstrate our approach with an empirical study of two Free/Open Source projects. a community-driven project, Apache, and a company-led project, Novell Evolution. We discovered that most functions never change; when they do their number of modifications is correlated with their size, and that very few authors who modify each; finally we show that the departure of a developer from a software project slows the evolution of the functions that she authored."

  "Abstract": "The statistical distributions of different software properties have been thoroughly studied in the past, including software size, complexity and the number of defects. In the case of object-oriented systems, these distributions have been found to obey a power law, a common statistical distribution also found in many other fields. However, we have found that for some statistical properties, the behavior does not entirely follow a power law, but a mixture between a lognormal and a power law distribution. Our study is based on the Qualitas Corpus, a large compendium of diverse Java-based software projects. We have measured the Chidamber and Kemerer metrics suite for every file of every Java project in the corpus. Our results show that the range of high values for the different metrics follows a power law distribution, whereas the rest of the range follows a lognormal distribution. This is a pattern typical of so-called double Pareto distributions, also found in empirical studies for other software properties."

  "Abstract": "An in-process view into a software development project's health is critical for its success. However, in services organizations, a typical software development team employs a heterogeneous set of tools based on client requirements through the different phases of the software project. The use of disparate tools with non-compatible outputs makes it very difficult to extract one coherent picture of the project's health and status. Existing project management tools either work at the process layer and rely on manually entered information, or are activity centric, without a holistic view. In this paper, we present PIVoT, a metric-based framework for automated, non-invasive, and in-process data collection and analysis in heterogeneous software project environments, that provides rich, multi-dimensional insights into the project's health and trajectory. Here, we introduce the different analyses, insights and metrics, and discuss their usage in typical software projects."

  "Abstract": "In large-scale software systems that integrate many components originating from different vendors, the understanding of the functional importance of the components is critical for the dependability of the system. However, in general, gaining such understanding is difficult. Here we describe the application of the combination of dynamic analysis and network analysis to large-scale software systems with the aim to determine methods of classes that are functionally important with respect to a given functionality of the software. We use as a test case the Google Chrome and predict functionally important methods in a weak sense in the context of usage scenarios. We validate the predictions using mutation testing and evaluate the behavior of the software following the mutation change. Our results indicate that network analysis metrics based on measurement of structural integrity can be used to predict methods of classes that are functionally important with respect to a given functionality of the software system."

In this paper we propose the entropy of degree distribution as a new measure of software quality. \\n\\nWe present a study were software systems are considered as complex networks which are characterized by heterogeneous distribution of links. On such complex software networks we computed the entropy of degree distribution. We analyzed various releases of the publically available Eclipse and Netbeans software systems, calculating the entropy of degree distribution for every release analyzed. Our results display a good correlation between the entropy of degree distribution and the number of bugs for Eclipse and Netbeans. \\n\\nComplexity and quality metrics are in general computed on every system module while the entropy is just a scalar number that characterizes a whole system, this result suggests that the entropy of degree distribution could be considered as a global quality metric for large software systems. Our results need however to be confirmed for other large software systems."

With various analytic and computing technologies, software analytics is to enable software practitioners to performance data exploration and analysis in order to obtain insightful and actionable information for data-driven tasks around software and services. \\n\\nSoftware analytics is naturally tied with the software development practice mainly because (1) the data under study comes from real practice; (2) there are real problems to be answered using the data; (3) one of the success metrics of software analytics research is its influence and impact on the development practice. The process of transferring software analytics research results into practical use, a.k.a. technology transfer, is full of challenges, such as dealing with the scale and complexity of the real data, walking the last mile to build tools working well in practice instead of only being a demo or prototype, and effectively engaging the software practitioners to adopt the tools and provide feedback. \\n\\nAt the Software Analytics group in Microsoft Research Asia, we are conducting research in software analytics; and we also collaborate extensively with product teams across Microsoft. In this talk, I will discuss some of the research projects in our group; and I will also use some case studies to share our approaches and experiences in technology transfer."

This work proposes to address these issues by applying game mechanisms to bug tracking systems. We investigate the use of game mechanisms in Stack Overflow, an online community organized to resolve computer programming related problems, for which the improvements we seek for bug tracking systems also turn out to be relevant. The results of our Stack Overflow investigation show that its game mechanisms could be used to address these issues by motivating contributors to increase contribution frequency and quality, by filtering useful contributions, and by creating an agile and dependable moderation system. We proceed by mapping these mechanisms to open-source bug tracking systems, and find that most benefits are applicable. Additionally, our results motivate tailoring a reward and reputation system and summarizing bug reports as future directions for increasing the benefits of game mechanisms in bug tracking systems."

  "Abstract": "Empirical software engineering researchers are concerned with understanding the relationships between outcomes of interest, e.g. defects, and process and product measures. The use of correlations to uncover strong relationships is a natural precursor to multivariate modeling. Unfortunately, correlation coefficients can be difficult and/or misleading to interpret. For example, a strong correlation occurs between variables that stand in a polynomial relationship; this may lead one mistakenly, and eventually misleadingly, to model a polynomially related variable in a linear regression. Likewise, a non-monotonic functional, or even non-functional relationship might be entirely missed by a correlation coefficient. Outliers can influence standard correlation measures, tied values can unduly influence even robust non-parametric rank correlation,measures, and smaller sample sizes can cause instability in correlation measures. A new bivariate measure of association, Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC), promises to simultaneously discover if two variables have. a) any association, b) a functional relationship, and c) a non-linear relationship. The MIC is a very useful complement to standard rank correlation measures. It separately characterizes the existence of a relationship and its precise nature; thus, it enables more informed choices in modeling non-functional and non-linear relationships, and a more nuanced indicator of potential problems with the values reported by standard and rank correlation measures. We illustrate the use of MIC using a variety of software engineering metrics. We study and explain the distributional properties of MIC and related measures in software engineering data, and illustrate the value of these measures for the empirical software engineering researcher."

  "Abstract": "The mining of software repositories involves the extraction of both basic and value-added information from existing software repositories. The repositories will be mined to extract facts by different stakeholders (e.g. researchers, managers) and for various purposes. To avoid unnecessary pre-processing and analysis steps, sharing and integration of both basic and value-added facts are needed. In this research, we introduce SeCold, an open and collaborative platform for sharing software datasets. SeCold provides the first online software ecosystem Linked Data platform that supports data extraction and on-the-fly inter-dataset integration from major version control, issue tracking, and quality evaluation systems. In its first release, the dataset contains about two billion facts, such as source code statements, software licenses, and code clones from 18 000 software projects. In its second release the SeCold project will contain additional facts mined from issue trackers and versioning systems. Our approach is based on the same fundamental principle as Wikipedia. researchers and tool developers share analysis results obtained from their tools by publishing them as part of the SeCold portal and therefore make them an integrated part of the global knowledge domain. The SeCold project is an official member of the Linked Data dataset cloud and is currently the eighth largest online dataset available on the Web."

However, in recent years several widely-known projects have migrated their repositories to Distributed Version Control Systems, such as Mercurial, Bazaar, and Git. Such systems have technical features that allow contributors to work in new ways, as various different workflows are possible. We plan to study this migration process to assess how developers’ organization and their contributions are affected. As a first step, we present an analysis of the Mozilla repositories, which migrated from CVS to Mercurial in 2007. This analysis reveals both expected and unexpected aspects of the contributors’ activities."

  "Abstract": "A recent study finds that errors of omission are harder for programmers to detect than errors of commission. While several change recommendation systems already exist to prevent or reduce omission errors during software development, there have been very few studies on why errors of omission occur in practice and how such errors could be prevented. In order to understand the characteristics of omission errors, this paper investigates a group of bugs that were fixed more than once in open source projects - those bugs whose initial patches were later considered incomplete and to which programmers applied supplementary patches. \\n\\nOur study on Eclipse JDT core, Eclipse SWT, and Mozilla shows that a significant portion of resolved bugs (22% to 33%) involves more than one fix attempt. Our manual inspection shows that the causes of omission errors are diverse, including missed porting changes, incorrect handling of conditional statements, or incomplete refactorings, etc. While many consider that missed updates to code clones often lead to omission errors, only a very small portion of supplementary patches (12% in JDT, 25% in SWT, and 9% in Mozilla) have a content similar to their initial patches. This implies that supplementary change locations cannot be predicted by code clone analysis alone. Furthermore, 14% to 15% of files in supplementary patches are beyond the scope of immediate neighbors of their initial patch locations - they did not overlap with the initial patch locations nor had direct structural dependencies on them (e.g. calls, accesses, subtyping relations, etc.). These results call for new types of omission error prevention approaches that complement existing change recommendation systems."

  "Abstract": "Fast and accurate localization of software defects continues to be a difficult problem since defects can emanate from a large variety of sources and can often be intricate in nature. In this paper, we show how version histories of a software project can be used to estimate a prior probability distribution for defect proneness associated with the files in a given version of the project. Subsequently, these priors are used in an IR (Information Retrieval) framework to determine the posterior probability of a file being the cause of a bug. We first present two models to estimate the priors, one from the defect histories and the other from the modification histories, with both types of histories as stored in the versioning tools. Referring to these as the base models, we then extend them by incorporating a temporal decay into the estimation of the priors. We show that by just including the base models, the mean average precision (MAP) for bug localization improves by as much as 30%. And when we also factor in the time decay in the estimates of the priors, the improvements in MAP can be as large as 80%."

  "Abstract": "Much research energy in software engineering is focused on the creation of effort and defect prediction models. Such models are important means for practitioners to judge their current project situation, optimize the allocation of their resources, and make informed future decisions. However, software engineering data contains a large amount of variability. Recent research demonstrates that such variability leads to poor fits of machine learning models to the underlying data, and suggests splitting datasets into more fine-grained subsets with similar properties. In this paper, we present a comparison of three different approaches for creating statistical regression models to model and predict software defects and development effort. Global models are trained on the whole dataset. In contrast, local models are trained on subsets of the dataset. Last, we build a global model that takes into account local characteristics of the data. We evaluate the performance of these three approaches in a case study on two defect and two effort datasets. We find that for both types of data, local models show a significantly increased fit to the data compared to global models. The substantial improvements in both relative and absolute prediction errors demonstrate that this increased goodness of fit is valuable in practice. Finally, our experiments suggest that trends obtained from global models are too general for practical recommendations. At the same time, local models provide a multitude of trends which are only valid for specific subsets of the data. Instead, we advocate the use of trends obtained from global models that take into account local characteristics, as they combine the best of both worlds."

Unfortunately, such repositories often contain inaccurate, inconsistent, or missing data, which can originate misleading results. In this paper, we investigate how well data from bug repositories support the discovery of details about the software verification process in two open source projects, Eclipse and NetBeans. We have been able do identify quality assurance teams in NetBeans and to detect a well-defined verification phase in Eclipse. A major challenge, however, was to identify the verification techniques used in the projects. Moreover, we found cases in which a large batch of bug fixes is simultaneously reported to be verified, although no software verification was actually done. Such mass verifications, if not acknowledged, threatens analyses that rely on information about software verification reported on bug repositories. Therefore, we recommend that the exploratory analyses presented in this paper precede inferences based on reported verifications."

  "Abstract": "Many fault localization techniques have been proposed to facilitate debugging activities. Most of them attempt to pinpoint the location of faults (i.e., localize faults) based on a set of failing and correct executions and expect debuggers to investigate a certain number of located program elements to find faults. These techniques thus assume that faults are localizable, i.e., only one or a few lines of code that are close to one another are responsible for each fault. However, in reality, are faults localizable? In this work, we investigate hundreds of real faults in several software systems, and find that many faults may not be localizable to a few lines of code and these include faults with high severity level."

  "Abstract": "Power consumption is becoming more and more important with the increased popularity of smart-phones, tablets and laptops. The threat of reducing a customer's battery-life now hangs over the software developer who asks, ``will this next change be the one that causes my software to drain a customer's battery?'' One solution is to detect power consumption regressions by measuring the power usage of tests, but this is time-consuming and often noisy. An alternative is to rely on software metrics that allow us to estimate the impact that a change might have on power consumption thus relieving the developer from expensive testing. This paper presents a general methodology for investigating the impact of software change on power consumption, we relate power consumption to software changes, and then investigate the impact of static OO software metrics on power consumption. We demonstrated that software change can effect power consumption using the Firefox web-browser and the Azeurus/Vuze BitTorrent client. We found evidence of a potential relationship between some software metrics and power consumption. In conclusion, we explored the effect of software change on power consumption on two projects; and we provide an initial investigation on the impact of software metrics on power consumption."

The results of the analysis of this data are used for several purposes, including ascertaining the viability of new products, determining if customer support objectives are being met, setting engineering in-process and customer experience yearly metrics goals, and assessing, indirectly, the success of engineering initiatives. Analyzing this data, which includes 110,000 yearly sets of survey responses that address over 100 product and services categories, is in many respects complicated. For example, skip logic is an integral part of the survey mechanics, and forming aggregate views of customer sentiment is statistically challenging in this data environment. In this paper, we describe several of the various analysis approaches currently used, pointing out some situations where a high level of precision is not easily achieved, and some situations in which it is possible to easily end up with erroneous results. The analysis and statistical territory covered in this paper is in parts well-known and straightforward, but other parts, which we address, are susceptible to large inaccuracies and errors. We address several of these difficulties and develop reasonable solutions for two known issues, high missing value levels and high colinearity of independent variables."

In this work, we demonstrate how adding real-world usage data enables addressing broader questions of how software systems are actually used in practice, and by inference how development characteristics ultimately affect deployment, adoption, and usage. In particular, we explore how usage data that has been extracted from web server logs can be unified with product release history to study questions that concern both users’ detailed dynamic behaviour as well as broad adoption trends across different deployment environments. To validate our approach, we performed a study of two open source web browsers. Firefox and Chrome. We found that while Chrome is being adopted at a consistent rate across platforms, Linux users have an order of magnitude higher rate of Firefox adoption. Also, Firefox adoption has been concentrated mainly in North America, while Chrome users appear to be more evenly distributed across the globe. Finally, we detected no evidence in age-specific differences in navigation behaviour among Chrome and Firefox users; however, we hypothesize that younger users are more likely to have more up-to-date versions than more mature users."

Unlike other software repositories traditionally used in MSR work, app stores usually do not provide source code. However, they do provide a wealth of other information in the form of pricing and customer reviews. Therefore, we use data mining to extract feature information, which we then combine with more readily available information to analyse apps' technical, customer and business aspects. We applied our approach to the 32,108 non-zero priced apps available in the Blackberry app store in September 2011. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between customer rating and the rank of app downloads, though perhaps surprisingly, there is no correlation between price and downloads, nor between price and rating. More importantly, we show that these correlation findings carry over to (and are even occasionally enhanced within) the space of data mined app features, providing evidence that our `App store MSR' approach can be valuable to app developers."

This informs us of the features or parts of the project that are more problematic at any given point of time. In turn, this can be used to aid resource allocation (such as time and man power) to parts or features. We support these ideas by presenting the results of issue topic distributions over time using statistical analysis of the bug descriptions and comments for the Android open source project.

We report three interesting findings, firstly while some architectural layers have a diverse interaction of people, attracting not only non-central reporters but highly important ones, other layers are mostly captivating for peripheral actors. Second, we exposed that even the bug lifetime is similar across the architectural layers, some of them have higher bug density and differential percentages of unsolved bugs.

Open source systems have traditionally taken advantage of distributed and volunteer collaboration to carry localization tasks. In this paper, we will analyze the Android source code repository to know how localization and translation is managed. who participates in this kind of tasks, if the translation workflows, participants and processes follow the same patterns as the rest of the development, and if the Android project takes benefit from external contributions. Our results show that Android should ease the localization tasks to benefit from external contributions. Steps towards obtaining a specialized team as found in many other free software projects are also encouraged."

  "Title": "MSR 2012 Keynote: The Evolution of the Social Programmer",
  "Type": "Keynote",
  "Key": "msr12-idk1-storey",
  "Authors": ["Margaret-Anne Storey"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Victoria, Canada"],
  "Abstract": "Social media has revolutionized how humans create and curate knowledge artifacts [1]. It has increased individual engagement, broadened community participation and led to the formation of new social networks. This paradigm shift is particularly evident in software engineering in three distinct ways. firstly, in how software stakeholders co-develop and form communities of practice; secondly, in the complex and distributed software ecosystems that are enabled through insourcing, outsourcing, open sourcing and crowdsourcing of components and related artifacts; and thirdly, by the emergence of socially-enabled software repositories and collaborative development environments [2]. \\n\\nIn this talk, I will discuss how software engineers are becoming more \"social\" and altruistic, defying the old-fashioned stereotype of the solitary and selfish programmer [3]. I conjecture that media literacy and networking skills will become just as important as technical skills for creating, curating and managing today’s complex software ecosystems and software knowledge [4]. Furthermore, these skills will expand who can participate in the design and evaluation of software, broadening the perspective of who is a software developer. \\n\\nI will also discuss the influence of social media and social networks on software development environments and repositories. I propose that social media is responsible for the shift from a software repository as a \"space\" that stores software artifacts, to a \"place\" where developers learn, reuse, share and network [5]. A space-to-place transformation is evident when we compare Eclipse with Jazz [6], SourceForge with GitHub [7], traditional software forums with Question and Answer websites such as StackOverFlow [8], and the role of blogs [9] and wikis [10] as a new \"place for documentation\". \\n\\nThe convergence of software tools with social media naturally influences the information that can be mined from software repositories, challenging not only the questions that motivate these mining activities, but also the very definitions of what comprises a software repository or even a software programmer [4]. Finally, I will suggest that it is imperative to consider both the positive and negative consequences of how programming in a socially-networked world might impact software quality and software engineering practices. As Marshall McLuhan eloquently said, \"If we understand the revolutionary transformations caused by new media, we can anticipate and control them; but if we continue in our self-induced subliminal trance, we will be their slaves.\" [11]"

  "Abstract": "Determining whether two or more packages cannot be installed together is an important issue in the quality assurance process of package-based distributions. Unfortunately, the sheer number of different configurations to test makes this task particularly challenging, and hundreds of such incompatibilities go undetected by the normal testing and distribution process until they are later reported by a user as bugs that we call ``conflict defects''. \\n\\nWe performed an extensive case study of conflict defects extracted from the bug tracking systems of Debian and Red Hat. According to our results, conflict defects can be grouped into five main categories. We show that with more detailed package meta-data, about 30~% of all conflict defects could be prevented relatively easily, while another 30~% could be found by targeted testing of packages that share common resources or characteristics. These results allow us to make precise suggestions on how to prevent and detect conflict defects in the future."

  "Abstract": "Specifications are important for many activities during software construction and maintenance process such as testing, verification, debugging and repairing. Despite their importance, specifications are often missing, informal or incomplete because they are difficult to write manually. Many techniques have been proposed to automatically mine specifications describing method call sequence from execution traces or source code using frequent pattern mining. Unfortunately, a sizeable number of such \"interesting\" specifications discovered by frequent pattern mining may not capture the correct use patterns of method calls. Consequently, when used in software testing or verification, these mined specifications lead to many false positive defects, which in turn consume much effort for manual investigation. \\n\\nWe present a novel framework for automatically discovering legitimate specifications from execution traces using a mutation testing based approach. Such an approach gives a semantics bearing to the legitimacy of the discovered specifications. We introduce the notion of maximal precision and completeness as the desired forms of discovered specifications, and describe in detail suppression techniques that aid efficient discovery. Preliminary evaluation of this approach on several open source software projects shows that specifications discovered through our approach, compared with those discovered through frequent pattern mining, are much more precise and complete. When used in finding bugs, our specifications also locate defects with significantly fewer false positives and more true positives."

  "Abstract": "Code search is an integral part of software development and program comprehension. The difficulty of code search lies in the inability to guess the exact words used in the code. Therefore, it is crucial for keyword-based code search to expand queries with semantically related words, e.g., synonyms and abbreviations, to increase the search effectiveness. However, it is limited to rely on resources such as English dictionaries and WordNet to obtain semantically related words in software, because many words that are semantically related in software are not semantically related in English. This paper proposes a simple and general technique to automatically infer semantically related words in software by leveraging the context of words in comments and code. We achieve a reasonable accuracy in seven large and popular code bases written in C and Java. Our further evaluation against the state of art shows that our technique can achieve a higher precision and recall."

  "Abstract": "Concurrency bugs are notoriously difficult to find and fix. Several prior empirical studies have identified the prevalence and challenges of concurrency bugs in open source projects, and several existing tools can be used to identify concurrency errors such as data races. However, little is known about how concurrency bugs evolve over time. In this paper, we examine the evolution of data races by analyzing samples of the committed code in two open source projects over a multi-year period. Specifically, we identify how the data races in these programs change over time."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Ulm, Germany"],
  "Abstract": "Bugs are hard to find. Static analysis tools are capable of systematically detecting predefined sets of errors, but extending them to find new error types requires a deep understanding of the underlying programming language. Manual reviews on the other hand, while being able to reveal more individual errors, require much more time. We present a new approach to automatically detect bugs through comparison with a large code database. The source file is analyzed for similar but slightly different code fragments in the database. Frequent occurrences of common differences indicate a potential bug that can be fixed by applying the modification back to the original source file. \\n\\nIn this paper, we give an overview of the resulting algorithm and some important implementation details. We further evaluate the circumstances under which good detection rates can be achieved. The results demonstrate that consistently high detection rates of up to 50% are possible for certain error types across different programming languages."

  "Authors": ["Foutse Khomh", "Tejinder Dhaliwal", "Ying Zou", "Bram Adams"],

  "Abstract": "Nowadays, many software companies are shifting from the traditional 18-month release cycle to shorter release cycles. For example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users' waiting time for a new release and offer better marketing opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well, since shorter release cycles result in shorter testing periods. In this paper, we empirically study the development process of Mozilla Firefox in 2010 and 2011, a period during which the project transitioned to a shorter release cycle. We compare crash rates, median uptime, and the proportion of post-release bugs of the versions that had a shorter release cycle with those having a traditional release cycle, to assess the relation between release cycle length and the software quality observed by the end user. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more post-release bugs and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier)."

  "Abstract": "Researchers have proposed various metrics based on measurable aspects of the source code entities (e.g., methods, classes, files, or modules) and the social structure of a software project in an effort to explain the relationships between software development and software defects.However, these metrics largely ignore the actual functionality, i.e., the conceptual concerns, of a software system, which are the main technical concepts that reflect the business logic or domain of the system. For instance, while lines of code may be a good general measure for defects, a large entity responsible for simple I/O tasks is likely to have fewer defects than a small entity responsible for complicated compiler implementation details. In this paper, we study the effect of conceptual concerns on code quality. We use a statistical topic modeling technique to approximate software concerns as topics; we then propose various metrics on these topics to help explain the defect-proneness (i.e., quality) of the entities. Paramount to our proposed metrics is that they take into account the defect history of each topic. Case studies on multiple versions of Mozilla Firefox, Eclipse, and Mylyn show that (i) some topics are much more defect-prone than others, (ii) defect-prone topics tend to remain so over time, and (iii) defect-prone topics provide additional explanatory power for code quality over existing structural and historical metrics."

  "Abstract": "Software performance is one of the important qualities that makes software stand out in a competitive market. However, in earlier work we found that performance bugs take more time to fix, need to be fixed by more experienced developers and require changes to more code than non-performance bugs. In order to be able to improve the resolution of performance bugs, a better understanding is needed of the current practice and shortcomings of reporting, reproducing, tracking and fixing performance bugs. This paper qualitatively studies a random sample of 400 performance and non-performance bug reports of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome across four dimensions (Impact, Context, Fix and Fix validation). We found that developers and users face problems in reproducing performance bugs and have to spend more time discussing performance bugs than other kinds of bugs. Sometimes performance regressions are tolerated as a trade-off to improve something else."

  "Abstract": "Software maintenance tasks are mainly related to fixing defects and implementing new features. Higher efficiency in performing such tasks is therefore going to reduce the costs of maintenance. A previous study involving open source systems has shown that higher software maintainability corresponds to faster speed in fixing defects (Luijten, 2010). In this paper we replicate the previous study by mining bug report data of three proprietary software projects. In one of the projects, a correlation between higher software maintainability and faster defect resolution is confirmed. The quality of issue handling process (e.g., issue registration accuracy and completeness, scope and complexity of issue workflow) should be considered in further research as it might explain the circumstances under which the correlation can be observed."

  "Abstract": "Logical couplings between files in the commit his- tory of a software repository are instances of files being changed together. The evolution of couplings over commits’ history has been used for the localization and prediction of software defects in software reliability. Couplings have been represented in class graphs and change histories on the class-level have been used to identify defective modules. Our new approach inverts this perspective and constructs graphs of ordered commits coupled by common changed classes. These graphs, thus, represent the co-evolution of commits, structured by the change patterns among classes. We believe that co-evolutionary graphs are a promising new instrument for detecting defective software structures. As a first result, we have been able to correlate the history of logical couplings to the history of defects for every commit in the graph and to identify sub-structures of bug-fixing commits over sub-structures of normal commits."

  "Abstract": "There exist many approaches that help in pointing developers to the change-prone parts of a software system. Although beneficial, they mostly fall short in providing details of these changes. Fine-grained source code changes (SCC) capture such detailed code changes and their semantics on the statement level. These SCC can be condition changes, interface modifications, inserts or deletions of methods and attributes, or other kinds of statement changes. In this paper, we explore prediction models for whether a source file will be affected by a certain type of SCC. These predictions are computed on the static source code dependency graph and use social network centrality measures and object-oriented metrics. For that, we use change data of the Eclipse platform and the Azureus 3 project. The results show that Neural Network models can predict categories of SCC types. Furthermore, our models can output a list of the potentially change-prone files ranked according to their change-proneness, overall and per change type category."

It is hard to prove that a metric is valid, i.e., that measured numerical values imply anything on the vaguely defined, yet crucial software properties such as complexity and maintainability. \\n\\nThis paper employs statistical analysis and tests to check some plausible assumptions on the behavior of software and metrics measured for this software in retrospective on its versions evolution history. Among those are the reliability assumption implicit in the application of any code metric, and the assumption that the magnitude of change, i.e., increase or decrease of its size, in a software artifact is correlated with changes to its version number. \\n\\nPutting a suite of 36 metrics to the trial, we confirm most of the assumptions on a large repository of software artifacts. Surprisingly, we show that a substantial portion of the reliability of some metrics can be observed even in random changes to architecture. Another surprising result is that Boolean-valued metrics tend to flip their values more often in minor software version increments than in major increments."

Both FIREFOX and ECLIPSE have been the subject of many studies and are ubiquitous in the areas of software development and internet usage respectively. We identified the top contributors that made 95% of the changes over multiple major releases of FIREFOX and ECLIPSE and determined their geographic locations and organizational affiliations. We examine the distribution in each project’s constituent subsystems and report the relationship of pre- and post-release defects with distribution levels."

  "Abstract": "Microblogging is a new trend to communicate and to disseminate information. One microblog post could potentially reach millions of users. Millions of microblogs are generated on a daily basis on popular sites such as Twitter. The popularity of microblogging among programmers, software engineers, and software users has also led to their use of microblogs to communicate software engineering issues apart from using emails and other traditional communication channels. Understanding how millions of users use microblogs in software engineering related activities would shed light on ways we could leverage the fast evolving microblogging content to aid software development efforts. In this work, we perform a preliminary study on what the software engineering community microblogs about. We analyze the content of microblogs from Twitter and categorize the types of microblogs that are posted. We investigate the relative popularity of each category of microblogs. We also investigate what kinds of microblogs are diffused more widely in the Twitter network via the ``retweet'' feature. Our experiments show that microblogs commonly contain job openings, news, questions and answers, or links to download new tools and code. We find that microblogs concerning real-world events are more widely diffused in the Twitter network."

However, the maturing of formal techniques into real-life software engineering involves providing notations and tools that are readily understood and used by practitioners, and the integration of such tools with activities that are far from the unrealistic assumptions that characterized some earlier research in formal methods.

Despite the interest raised by this decade-old research topic, the development of WSN software is still carried out in a rather primitive fashion, by building software directly atop the operating system and by relying on the individual, hard-earned programming skills. WSN developers must face not only the functional application requirements but also a number of challenging, non-functional requirements and constraints resulting from scarce resources. The heterogeneity of network nodes, the unpredictable environmental influences, and the large size of the network further add to the difficulties. In the WSN community there is a growing awareness of the need for methodologies, techniques, and abstractions that simplify the development task and increase the confidence in the correctness and performance of the resulting software. Software engineering (SE) support is therefore sought, not only to ease the development task but also to make it more reliable, dependable, and repeatable. Nevertheless, this topic has received so far very little attention by the SE community. This third edition of SESENA aims to attract researchers from both the SE and WSN communities, not only to exchange recent research results on the topic, but also to stimulate discussion about the core open problems and to define a shared research agenda. The workshop welcomes both research contributions and position statements.",

  "Abstract": "ICT accounts for approximately 2% of world CO2 emissions, a figure equivalent to aviation, according to Gartner estimates. In fact, this 2% includes (only) the ‘in-use phase’ of hardware. in the remaining 98% software both operationalizes the private sector in doing its business and the public sector in supporting society, as well as delivering end-user applications that permeate our personal lives. Software can contribute to decrease power consumption (i.e. become greener) in at least two ways. First, by being more energy efficient, hence using lesser resources and causing fewer CO2 emissions. Second, by making its supported processes more sustainable, i.e. decreasing the emissions of governments, companies and individuals. To this end, enterprise software must be completely rethought to address sustainability issues and support sustainable & innovative business models and processes. Creating greener software is the focus of GREENS 2012 with special theme 'Green Knowledge for Sustainable Software Engineering.' It brings together software engineering researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice in green software, as well as research challenges, novel ideas, methods, experiences, and tools to support the engineering of sustainable and energy efficient software systems.",

The smart grid will create the capabilities to handle the challenges of increasing complexity in the bulk power grid, to respond to demand growth, support renewable energy sources and satisfy the requirements for enhanced, adaptive service quality. Achieving these goals requires a framework for the cohesive integration of communication and information technologies, interconnected in a complex energy and information real-time control network. This framework must provide the principle properties of smart grids, including self-healing, security, availability and responsiveness to demand and supply variability. \\n\\nHowever, the realization of these benefits requires a major sustained effort from the power and software industry. This effort must deliver software solutions that operate in real-time for the purposes of metering, communication, monitoring and control. Collectively, these emerging solutions pose a broad range of software engineering (SE) challenges, creating the need for members of the SE research community to interact with the power engineering community to address these issues. This workshop will facilitate this collaboration by bringing together members of these communities. They will be able to share perspectives and present findings from research and practice relevant to smart grid software and services. The goal of the workshop is to generate and publish a research agenda for improved tools, techniques, advanced computing capabilities (such as high performance and cloud computing), and standard-based open distributed architectures for smart grid software engineering.",

For instance, researchers and experienced users will be able to apply their expertise to industrial problems, while industrial participants can benefit from the suggested solutions. We also expect additional exchanges of ideas by connecting people working on similar challenges or similar solutions. \\n\\nWe invite short position papers that do one of the following. (1) Define and illustrate a concrete real-life problem that impedes SPLE adoption or that emerged after (a partial) SPLE adoption by an organization.

They provide developers with information to guide them in a number of activities (e.g., software navigation, debugging, refactoring), or to alert them of potential issues (e.g., conflicting changes, failure-inducing changes, duplicated functionality). Similarly, managers get only to see the information that is relevant to make a certain decision (e.g., bug distribution when allocating resources). Although many recommendation systems have demonstrable usefulness and usability in software engineering, a number of questions remain to be discussed and investigated. What recommendations do developers and managers actually need? How can we evaluate recommendations? Are there fundamentally different kinds of recommenders? How can we integrate recommendations from different sources? How can we protect the privacy of developers? How can new recommendation systems leverage lessons from existing ones? In this workshop, we will study advances in recommendation systems, with a special focus on evaluation, integration, and usability.",

  "Abstract": "The technical debt metaphor has gained significant traction in the software development community as a way to understand and communicate issues of intrinsic quality, value, and cost in the past few years. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a ''debt'' on which ''interest'' has to be paid and which should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. Little is known about technical debt, beyond feelings and opinions. The software engineering research community has an opportunity to study this phenomenon and improve the way it is handled. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs based on models of their economic impacts. The goal of this third workshop is to discuss managing technical debt as a part of the research agenda for the software engineering field, in particular focusing on eliciting and visualizing debt, and creating pay-back strategies.",

  "Abstract": "As software engineering is asked to answer dynamic, automated, adaptive, and possibly large scale demands, other computer science disciplines come in to play. Artificial Intelligence is a discipline that may bring software engineering new benefits. Conversely, software engineering can also play a role in alleviating development costs and the development effort associated with AI tools. Such mutually beneficial characteristics have appeared in the past few decades and still are evolving due to new challenges. The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to exchange and discuss the latest innovative synergistic AI and SE techniques and practices.",

  "Abstract": "The rapid evolution of software technology has brought monumental changes to virtually every market sector and has created enormous opportunities for innovation. One such opportunity is developing innovative systems through the composition of software services available over the Internet. Those services have the power to provide utility to users in a much more dynamic and flexible way than is possible with traditional software technology. However, service-oriented systems and their corresponding software services require fundamental changes to the way software is developed, deployed and maintained. Software that constitutes a service-oriented system is no longer owned by on single organization but is distributed and shared amongst many organizations. This distributed ownership opens up a whole range of research challenges, including the design, evolution, adaptation and quality assurance of service-oriented systems. \\n\\nThis workshop will outline and demonstrate results of fundamental research carried out within S-Cube, the European Network of Excellence on Software Services and Systems. S-Cube brings together 33 research organizations across Europe from disciplines extending beyond traditional realms of software engineering, including cloud computing, business process management and service-oriented computing. The workshop will also serve as a springboard to discuss software engineering research challenges for future service-oriented systems. Future software technology and methods will need to cope with trends such as the convergence of the Internet of Things and services; novel life-cycle models where the boundary between design and runtime will increasingly blur; online quality prediction and proactive adaptation; as well as novel architectural styles for large-scale, long-living service-oriented systems. \\n\\nParticipation to the workshop is open to everybody after registration. Paper submission to the S-Cube workshop will be by invitation only.",

This includes conveying how large-scale software is developed in real-world environments, so that graduates can contribute more effectively to such projects when starting a career. Software engineering education based on real-world experiences allows students to experience software engineering in all its facets and fosters students' motivation. \\n\\nEduRex 2012 shall provide a discussion forum for teachers, educators and practitioners to exchange ideas, concepts, and experience in experience-oriented learning of software engineering.

Advances in game engineering techniques can be adopted by the software engineering community to develop more engaging applications across diverse domains. education; healthcare; fitness; sustainable activities (e.g., recycling awareness); and so on. Successful computer games feature a property that is not always found in traditional software. they are highly engaging and intrinsically motivating. Games enthrall players and result in users willing to spend increasing amounts of time and money playing them. In addition, GAS 2012 provides a forum for advances in software engineering for developing more sustainable (\"greener\") software, which can be applied to game applications. For example, approaches that support adapting software to trade-off power consumption and video quality would benefit the game community. Software engineering techniques spanning patterns (requirements, design), middleware, testing techniques, development environments and processes for building sustainable software are of great interest. Last year’s GAS workshop brought together people from various fields and investigated the possibilities of this exciting research area - we aim to continue building these relationships and advancing the state of the art.",

Complexity arises from the need to co-design and create software at low-level of abstraction that also interacts closely with hardware, and with strong emphasis on dependability and mission-critical real-time constraints. Compared to traditional software development, the increasing complexity also exacerbates challenges in embedded software development processes, such as trouble in achieving sufficient product quality and timely delivery. In order to tackle these challenges in embedded software development, industry needs to apply software engineering technologies that are appropriate for specific situations. The SEES 2012 workshop aims to provide researchers and practitioners an international forum to discuss the issues and challenges in adopting software engineering methods for embedded systems development.",
