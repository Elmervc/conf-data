            "Abstract": "Video games make up an important part of the software industry, yet the software engineering community rarely studies video games. This imbalance is a problem if video game development differs from general software development, as some game experts suggest. In this paper we describe a study with 14 interviewees and 364 survey respondents. The study elicited substantial differences between video game development and other software development. For example, in game development, “cowboy coders” are necessary to cope with the continuous interplay between creative desires and technical constraints. Consequently, game developers are hesitant to use automated testing because of these tests’ rapid obsolescence in the face of shifting creative desires of game designers. These differences between game and non-game development have implications for research, industry, and practice. For instance, as a starting point for impacting game development, researchers could create testing tools that enable game developers to create tests that assert flexible behavior with little up-front investment.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present the results from two surveys related to data science applied to software engineering. The first survey solicited questions that software engineers would like data scientists to investigate about software, about software processes and practices, and about software engineers. Our analyses resulted in a list of 145 questions grouped into 12 categories. The second survey asked a different pool of software engineers to rate these 145 questions and identify the most important ones to work on first. Respondents favored questions that focus on how customers typically use their applications. We also saw opposition to questions that assess the performance of individual employees or compare them with one another. Our categorization and catalog of 145 questions can help researchers, practitioners, and educators to more easily focus their efforts on topics that are important to the software industry.",

            "Abstract": "Software engineering research and practice are hampered by the lack of a well-understood, top-level dependent variable. Recent initiatives on General Theory of Software Engineering suggest a multifaceted variable – Software Engineering Success. However, its exact dimensions are unknown. This paper investigates the dimensions (not causes) of software engineering success. An interdisciplinary sample of 191 design professionals (68 in the software industry) were interviewed concerning their perceptions of success. Non-software designers (e.g. architects) were included to increase the breadth of ideas and facilitate comparative analysis. Transcripts were subjected to supervised, semi-automated semantic content analysis, including a software developer vs. other professionals comparison. Findings suggest that participants view their work as time-constrained projects with explicit clients and other stakeholders. Success depends on stakeholder impacts – financial, social, physical and emotional – and is understood through feedback. Concern with meeting explicit requirements is peculiar to software engineering and design is not equated with aesthetics in many other fields. Software engineering success is a complex multifaceted variable, which cannot sufficiently be explained by traditional dimensions including user satisfaction, profitability or meeting requirements, budgets and schedules. A proto-theory of success is proposed, which models success as the net impact on a particular stakeholder at a particular time. Stakeholder impacts are driven by project efficiency, artifact quality and market performance. Success is not additive, e.g., ‘low’ success for clients does not average with ‘high’ success for developers to make ‘moderate’ success overall; rather, a project may be simultaneously successful and unsuccessful from different perspectives.",

            "Abstract": "Existing research in legacy system modernization has traditionally focused on technical challenges, and takes the standpoint that legacy systems are obsolete, yet crucial for an organization&#039;s operation. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether practitioners in the industry also share this perception. This paper describes the outcome of an exploratory study in which 26 industrial practitioners were interviewed on what makes a software system a legacy system, what the main drivers are that lead to the modernization of such systems, and what challenges are faced during the modernization process. The findings of the interviews have been validated by means of a survey with 198 respondents. The results show that practitioners value their legacy systems highly, the challenges they face are not just technical, but also include business and organizational aspects.",

            "Abstract": "Concurrent programs are prone to various classes of difficult-to-detect faults, of which data races are particularly prevalent. Prior work has attempted to increase the cost-effectiveness of approaches for testing for data races by employing race detection techniques, but to date, no work has considered cost-effective approaches for re-testing for races as programs evolve. In this paper we present SimRT, an automated regression testing framework for use in detecting races introduced by code modifications. SimRT employs a regression test selection technique, focused on sets of program elements related to race detection, to reduce the number of test cases that must be run on a changed program to detect races that occur due to code modifications, and it employs a test case prioritization technique to improve the rate at which such races are detected. Our empirical study of SimRT reveals that it is more efficient and effective for revealing races than other approaches, and that its constituent test selection and prioritization components each contribute to its performance.",

            "Abstract": "As software evolves, problematic changes can significantly degrade software performance, i.e., introducing performance regression. Performance regression testing is an effective way to reveal such issues in early stages. Yet because of its high overhead, this activity is usually performed infrequently. Consequently, when performance regression issue is spotted at a certain point, multiple commits might have been merged since last testing. Developers have to spend extra time and efforts narrowing down which commit caused the problem. Existing efforts try to improve performance regression testing efficiency through test case reduction or prioritization.  In this paper, we propose a new lightweight and white-box approach, performance risk analysis (PRA), to improve performance regression testing efficiency via testing target prioritization. The analysis statically evaluates a given source code commit&#039;s risk in introducing performance regression. Performance regression testing can leverage the analysis result to test commits with high risks first while delaying or skipping testing on low-risk commits.  To validate this idea&#039;s feasibility, we conduct a study on 100 real-world performance regression issues from three widely used, open-source software. Guided by insights from the study, we design PRA and build a tool, PerfScope. Evaluation on the examined problematic commits shows our tool can successfully alarm 91% of them. Moreover, on 600 randomly picked new commits from six large-scale software, with our tool, developers just need to test only 14-22% of the 600 commits and will still be able to alert 87-95% of the commits with performance regression.",

            "Abstract": "One of the key challenges of developers testing code is determining a test suite&#039;s quality -- its ability to find faults. The most common approach is to use code coverage as a measure for test suite quality, and diminishing returns in coverage or high absolute coverage as a stopping rule. In testing research, suite quality is often evaluated by a suite&#039;s ability to kill mutants (artificially seeded potential faults). Determining which criteria best predict mutation kills is critical to practical estimation of test suite quality. Previous work has only used small sets of programs, and usually compares multiple suites for a single program. Practitioners, however, seldom compare suites --- they evaluate one suite. Using suites (both manual and automatically generated) from a large set of real-world open-source projects shows that evaluation results differ from those for suite-comparison: statement (not block, branch, or path) coverage predicts mutation kills best.",

            "Abstract": "Time pressure is prevalent in the software industry in which shorter and shorter deadlines and high customer demands lead to increasingly tight deadlines. However, the effects of time pressure have received little attention in software engineering research. We performed a controlled experiment on time pressure with 97 observations from 54 subjects. Using a two-by-two crossover design, our subjects performed requirements review and test case development tasks. We found statistically significant evidence that time pressure increases efficiency in test case development (high effect size Cohen’s d=1.279) and in requirements review (medium effect size Cohen’s d=0.650). However, we found no statistically significant evidence that time pressure would decrease effectiveness or cause adverse effects on motivation, frustration or perceived performance. We also investigated the role of knowledge but found no evidence of the mediating role of knowledge in time pressure as suggested by prior work, possibly due to our subjects. We conclude that applying moderate time pressure for limited periods could be used to increase efficiency in software engineering tasks that are well structured and straight forward.",

            "Abstract": "The structure of component and connector (C&amp;C) models, which are used in many application domains of software engineering, consists of components at different containment levels, their typed input and output ports, and the connectors between them. C&amp;C views, which we have presented at FSE&#039;13, can be used to specify structural properties of C&amp;C models in an expressive and intuitive way.  In this work we address the verification of a C&amp;C model against a C&amp;C view and present efficient (polynomial) algorithms to decide satisfaction. A unique feature of our work, not present in existing approaches to checking structural properties of C&amp;C models, is the generation of witnesses for satisfaction/non-satisfaction and of short natural-language texts, which serve to explain and formally justify the verification results and point the engineer to its causes.  A prototype tool and an evaluation over four example systems with multiple views, performance and scalability experiments, as well as a user study of the usefulness of the witnesses for engineers, demonstrate the contribution of our work to the state-of-the-art in component and connector modeling and analysis.",

            "Abstract": "System designers today are focusing less on point solutions for complex systems and more on design spaces, often with a focus on understanding tradeoffs among non-functional properties across such spaces. This shift places a premium on the efficient comparative evaluation of non-functional properties of designs in such spaces. While static analysis of designs will sometimes suffice, often one must run designs dynamically, under comparable loads, to determine properties and tradeoffs. Yet variant designs often present variant interfaces, requiring that common loads be specialized to many interfaces. The main contributions of this paper are a mathematical framework, architecture, and tool for specification-driven synthesis of design spaces and common loads specialized to individual designs for dynamic tradeoff analysis of non-functional properties in large design spaces. To test our approach we used it to run an experiment to test the validity of static metrics for object-relational database mappings, requiring design space and load synthesis for, and dynamic analysis of, hundreds of database designs.",

Product line approaches simplify the handling of software variants while model transformations automate software manipulations such as refactoring, optimization, code generation, etc. While these techniques are well understood independently, combining them to get the benefit of both poses a challenge because most model transformations apply to individual models while model-level product lines represent sets of models. In this paper, we address this challenge by providing an approach for automatically ``lifting&#039;&#039; model transformations so that they can be applied to product lines. We illustrate our approach using a case study and evaluate it through a set of experiments.",

            "Abstract": "Goal oriented methods have been successfully employed for eliciting and elaborating software requirements. When goals are assigned to an agent, they have to be operationalised: the agent’s operations have to be refined, by equipping them with appropriate enabling and triggering conditions, so that the goals are fulfilled. Goal operationalisation generally demands a significant effort of the engineer. Although there exist approaches that tackle this problem, they are either informal or at most semi automated, requiring the engineer to assist in the process. In this paper, we present an approach for goal operationalisation that automatically computes required preconditions and required triggering conditions for operations, so that the resulting operations establish the goals. The process is iterative, is able to deal with safety goals and particular kinds of liveness goals, and is based on the use of interpolation and SAT solving.",

Not all combinations of configuration options are valid though, and constraints arise for technical or non-technical reasons. Explicitly describing these constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate creating variability models, we need to identify the origin of such configuration constraints. We propose an approach which uses build-time errors and a novel feature-effect heuristic to automatically extract configuration constraints from C code. We conduct an empirical study on four highly-configurable open-source systems with existing variability models having three objectives in mind: evaluate the accuracy of our approach, determine the recoverability of existing variability-model constraints using our analysis, and classify the sources of variability-model constraints. We find that both our extraction heuristics are highly accurate (93% and 77% respectively), and that we can recover 19% of the existing variability-models using our approach. However, we find that many of the remaining constraints require expert knowledge or more expensive analyses. We argue that our approach, tooling, and experimental results support researchers and practitioners working on variability model re-engineering, evolution, and consistency-checking techniques.",

            "Abstract": "Modern software often exposes configuration options that enable users to customize its behavior. During software evolution, developers may change how the configuration options behave. When upgrading to a new software version, users may need to re-configure the software by changing the values of certain configuration options.  This paper addresses the following question during the evolution of a configurable software system: which configuration options should a user change to maintain the software&#039;s desired behavior? This paper presents a technique (and its tool implementation, called ConfSuggester) to troubleshoot configuration errors caused by software evolution. ConfSuggester uses dynamic profiling, execution trace comparison, and static analysis to link the undesired behavior to its root cause - a configuration option whose value can be changed to produce desired behavior from the new software version.  We evaluated ConfSuggester on 8 configuration errors from 6 configurable software systems written in Java. For 6 errors, the rootcause configuration option was ConfSuggester&#039;s first suggestion. For 1 error, the root cause was ConfSuggester&#039;s third suggestion. The root cause of the remaining error was ConfSuggester&#039;s sixth suggestion. Overall, ConfSuggester produced significantly better results than two existing techniques. ConfSuggester runs in just a few minutes, making it an attractive alternative to manual debugging.",

To maintain or manage code clones, developers often have to investigate differences of multiple cloned code fragments. However,existing program differencing techniques compare only two code fragments at a time. Developers then have to manually combine several pairwise differencing results. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically detecting differences across multiple clone instances. We have implemented our approach as an Eclipse plugin and evaluated its accuracy with three Java software systems. Our evaluation shows that our algorithm has precision over 97.66% and recall over 95.63% in three open source Java projects. We also conducted a user study of 18 developers to evaluate the usefulness of our approach for eight clone-related refactoring tasks. Our study shows that our approach can significantly improve developers’performance in refactoring decisions, refactoring details, and task completion time on clone-related refactoring tasks. Automatically detecting differences across multiple clone instances also opens opportunities for building practical applications of code clones in software maintenance, such as auto-generation of application skeleton, intelligent simultaneous code editing.",

            "Abstract": "Besides traditional problems such as potential bugs, (smartphone) application clones on Android markets bring new threats. That is, attackers clone the code from legitimate Android applications, assemble it with malicious code or advertisements, and publish these ``purpose-added&quot; app clones on the same or other markets for benefits. Three inherent and unique characteristics make app clones difficult to detect by existing techniques: a billion opcode problem caused by cross-market publishing, gap between code clones and app clones, and prevalent Type 2 and Type 3 clones.  Existing techniques achieve either accuracy or scalability, but not both. To achieve both goals, we use a geometry characteristic, called centroid, of dependency graphs to measure the similarity between methods (code fragments) in two apps. Then we synthesize the method-level similarities and draw a Y/N conclusion on app (core functionality) cloning. The observed ``centroid effect&quot; and the inherent ``monotonicity&quot; property enable our approach to achieve both high accuracy and scalability. We implemented the app clone detection system and evaluated it on five whole Android markets (including 150,145 apps, 203 million methods and 26 billion opcodes). It takes less than one hour to perform cross-market app clone detection on the five markets after generating centroids only once.",

            "Abstract": "Crowdsourcing is an emerging and promising approach which involves delegating a variety of tasks to an unknown workforce - the crowd. Crowdsourcing has been applied quite successfully in various contexts from basic tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk to solving complex industry problems, e.g. InnoCentive. Companies are increasingly using crowdsourcing to accomplish specific software development tasks. However, very little research exists on this specific topic. This paper presents an in-depth industry case study of crowdsourcing software development at a multinational corporation. Our case study highlights a number of challenges that arise when crowdsourcing software development. For example, the crowdsourcing development process is essentially a waterfall model and this must eventually be integrated with the agile approach used by the company. Crowdsourcing works better for specific software development tasks that are less complex and stand-alone without interdependencies. The development cost was much greater than originally expected, overhead in terms of company effort to prepare specifications and answer crowdsourcing community queries was much greater, and the time-scale to complete contests, review submissions and resolve quality issues was significant. Finally, quality issues were pushed later in the lifecycle given the lengthy process necessary to identify and resolve quality issues. Given the emphasis in software engineering on identifying bugs as early as possible, this is quite problematic.",

This distribution comes at a cost -- distributed teams face challenges from differing cultures, skill levels, and a lack of shared working hours. In this paper we examine whether and how geographic and temporal separation in a large scale distributed software development influences developer interactions. We mine the work item trackers for a large commercial software project with a globally distributed development team. We examine both the time to respond and the propensity of individuals to respond and find that when taken together, geographic distance has little effect, while temporal separation has a significant negative impact on the time to respond. However, both have little impact on the social network of individuals in the organization. These results suggest that while temporally distributed teams do communicate, it is at a slower rate, and firms may wish to locate partner teams in similar time zones for maximal performance.",

Research has established that software developers use Twitter in their work, but this has not yet been examined in detail. Twitter is an important medium in some software engineering circles—understanding its use could lead to improved support, and learning more about the reasons for non-adoption could inform the design of improved tools. In a qualitative study, we surveyed 271 and interviewed 27 developers active on GitHub. We find that Twitter helps them keep up with the fast-paced development landscape. They use it to stay aware of industry changes, for learning, and for building relationships. We discover the challenges they experience and extract their coping strategies. Some developers do not want to or cannot embrace Twitter for their work—we show their reasons and alternative channels.

            "Abstract": "In distributed software development synchronized actions are important for completion of complex, interleaved tasks that require the abilities of multiple people. Synchronous development is manifested when file commits by two developers are close together in time and modify the same files. Here we propose quantitative methods for identifying synchronized activities in OSS projects, and use them to relate developer synchronization with effective productivity and communication. In particular, we define co-commit bursts and communication bursts, as intervals of time rich in co-commit and correspondence activities, respectively, and construct from them smoothed time series which can be, subsequently, correlated to discover synchrony. We find that synchronized co-commits between developers are associated with their effective productivity and coordination: during co-commit bursts, vs. at other times, the project size grows faster even though the overall coding effort slows down. We also find strong correlation between synchronized co-commits and communication, that is, for pairs of developers, more co-commit bursts are accompanied with more communication bursts, and their relationship follows closely a linear model. In addition, synchronized co-commits and communication activities occur very close together in time, thus, they can also be thought of as synchronizing each other. This study can help with better understanding collaborative mechanisms in OSS and the role communication plays in distributed software engineering.",

In this session, Kim et al. presented PAR, a novel template-based approach for fixing Java bugs. We strongly disagree with key points of this paper. Our critical review has two goals. First, we aim at explaining why we disagree with Kim and colleagues and why the reasons behind this disagreement are important for research on automatic software repair in general. Second, we aim at contributing to the field with a clarification of the essential ideas behind automatic software repair. In particular we discuss the main evaluation criteria of automatic software repair: understandability, correctness and completeness. We show that depending on how one sets up the repair scenario, the evaluation goals may be contradictory. Eventually, we discuss the nature of fix acceptability and its relation to the notion of software correctness.",

            "Abstract": "Database-centric programs form the backbone of many enterprise systems. Fixing defects in such programs takes much human effort due to the interplay between imperative code and database-centric logic. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for automated fixing of bugs in the selection condition of database statements (e.g., WHERE clause of SELECT statements) – a common form of bugs in such programs. Our key observation is that in real-world data, there is information latent in the distribution of data that can be useful to repair selection conditions efficiently. Given a faulty database program and input data, only a part of which induces the defect, our novelty is in determining the correct behavior for the defect-inducing data by taking advantage of the information revealed by the rest of the data. We accomplish this by employing semi-supervised learning to predict the correct behavior for defect-inducing data and by patching up any inaccuracies in the prediction by a SAT-based combinatorial search. Next, we learn a compact decision tree for the correct behavior, including the correct behavior on the defect-inducing data. This tree suggests a plausible fix to the selection condition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on seven realworld examples.",

            "Abstract": "Automated program repair recently received considerable attentions, and many techniques on this research area have been proposed. Among them, two genetic-programming-based techniques, GenProg and Par, have shown the promising results. In particular, GenProg has been used as the baseline technique to check the repair effectiveness of new techniques in much literature. Although GenProg and Par have shown their strong ability of fixing real-life bugs in nontrivial programs, to what extent GenProg and Par can benefit from genetic programming, used by them to guide the patch search process, is still unknown.  To address the question, we present a new automated repair technique using random search, which is commonly considered much simpler than genetic programming, and implement a prototype tool called RSRepair. Experiment on 7 programs with 24 versions shipping with real-life bugs suggests that RSRepair, in most cases (23/24), outperforms GenProg in terms of both repair effectiveness (requiring fewer patch trials) and efficiency (requiring fewer test case executions), justifying the stronger strength of random search over genetic programming. According to experimental results, we suggest that every proposed technique using optimization algorithm should check its effectiveness by comparing it with random search.",

            "Abstract": "Being able to automatically repair programs is at the same time a very compelling vision and an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we present MintHint, a novel technique for program repair that is a departure from most of today’s approaches. Instead of trying to fully automate program repair, which is often an unachievable goal, MintHint performs statistical correlation analysis to identify expressions that are likely to occur in the repaired code and generates, using pattern-matching based synthesis, repair hints from these expressions. Intuitively, these hints suggest how to rectify a faulty statement and help developers find a complete, actual repair.  We also present an empirical evaluation of MintHint in two parts. The first part is a user study that shows that, when debugging, developers’ productivity improved manyfold with the use of repair hints—instead of traditional fault localization information alone. The second part consists of applying MintHint to several faults in Unix utilities to further assess the effectiveness of the approach. Our results show that MintHint performs well even in common situations where (1) the repair space searched does not contain the exact repair, and (2) the operational specification obtained from the test cases for repair is incomplete or even imprecise, which can be challenging for approaches aiming at fully automated repair.",

Designing applications that meet user behaviors, by efficiently supporting the prevalent navigation patterns, and evolving with them requires new approaches that go beyond classic software engineering solutions. We present a novel approach that automates the acquisition of user-interaction requirements in an incremental and reflective way. Our solution builds upon inferring a set of probabilistic Markov models of the users&#039; navigational behaviors, dynamically extracted from the interaction history given in the form of a log file. We annotate and analyze the inferred models to verify quantitative properties by means of probabilistic model checking. The paper investigates the advantages of the approach referring to a Web application currently in use.",

            "Abstract": "Most application code evolves incrementally, and especially so when being maintained after the applications have been deployed. Yet, most data-flow analyses do not take advantage of this fact. Instead they require clients to recompute the entire analysis even if little code has changed—a time consuming undertaking, especially with large libraries or when running static analyses often, e.g., on a continuous-integration server. In this work, we present Reviser, a novel approach for automatically and efficiently updating inter-procedural dataflow analysis results in response to incremental program changes. Reviser follows a clear-and-propagate philosophy, aiming at clearing and recomputing analysis information only where required, thereby greatly reducing the required computational effort. The Reviser algorithm is formulated as an extension to the IDE framework for Inter-procedural Finite Distributed Environment problems and automatically updates arbitrary IDE-based analyses. We have implemented Reviser as an open-source extension to the Heros IFDS/IDE solver and the Soot program-analysis framework. An evaluation of Reviser on various client analyses and target programs shows performance gains of up to 80% in comparison to a full recomputation. The experiments also show Reviser to compute the same results as a full recomputation on all instances tested.",

            "Abstract": "Self-adaptation enables software to execute successfully in dynamic, unpredictable, and uncertain environments.  Control theory provides a broad set of mathematically grounded techniques for adapting the behavior of dynamic systems. While it has been applied to specific software control problems, it has proved difficult to define methodologies allowing non-experts to systematically apply control techniques to create adaptive software. These difficulties arise because computer systems are usually non-linear, with varying workloads and heterogeneous components, making it difficult to model software as a dynamic system; i.e., by means of differential or difference equations.  This paper proposes a broad scope methodology for automatically constructing both an approximate dynamic model of a software system and a suitable controller for managing its non-functional requirements. Despite its generality, this methodology provides formal guarantees concerning the system&#039;s dynamic behavior by keeping its model continuously updated to compensate for changes in the execution environment and effects of the initial approximation.  We apply the methodology to three case studies, demonstrating its generality by tackling different domains (and different non-functional requirements) with the same approach. Being broadly applicable and fully automated, this methodology may allow the adoption of control theoretical solutions (and their formal properties) for a wide range of software adaptation problems.",

While in many circumstances of probabilistic model checking it is reasonable to anticipate a possible discrepancy between a stochastic model and a real-world system it represents, the state-of-the-art provides little account for the effects of this discrepancy on verification results. To address this problem, we present a perturbation approach in which quantities such as transition probabilities in the stochastic model are allowed to be perturbed from their measured values. We present a rigorous mathematical characterization for variations that can occur to verification results in the presence of model perturbations. The formal treatment is based on the analysis of a parametric variant of discrete-time Markov chains, called parametric Markov chains (PMCs), which are equipped with a metric to measure their perturbed vector variables. We employ an asymptotic method from perturbation theory to compute two forms of perturbation bounds, namely condition numbers and quadratic bounds, for automata-based verification of PMCs. We also evaluate our approach with case studies on variant models for three widely studied systems, the Zeroconf protocol, the Leader Election Protocol and the NAND Multiplexer.",

In this paper we present the first in-depth, large scale empirical study that looks at the influence of DVCS on the practice of splitting, grouping, and committing changes. We recruited 820 participants for a survey that sheds light into the practice of using DVCS. We also analyzed 409M lines of code changed by 358300 commits, made by 5890 developers, in 132 repositories containing a total of 73M LOC. Using this data, we uncovered some interesting facts. For example, (i) commits made in distributed repositories were 32% smaller than the centralized ones, (ii) developers split commits more often in DVCS, and (iii) DVCS commits are more likely to have references to issue tracking labels.",

Although CVCSs and DVCSs have been studied extensively, there has been little research on the transition across these systems. This paper investigates the transition process, from the developer’s view, in a large company. The paper captures the transition reasons, barriers, and outcomes through 10 developer interviews, and investigates these findings through a survey, participated by 70 developers. The paper identifies that the majority of the developers need to work incrementally and offline, and manage multiple contexts efficiently. DVCSs fulfill these developer needs; however the transition comes with a cost depending on the previous development workflow. The paper discusses the transition reasons, barriers and outcomes, and provides recommendations for teams planning such a transition. The paper shows that lightweight branches, and local and incremental commits were the main reasons for developers wanting to move to a DVCS. Further, the paper identifies the main problems with the transition process as: steep DVCS learning curve; incomplete DVCS integration with the rest of the development workflow; and DVCS scaling issues.",

            "Abstract": "The advent of distributed version control systems has led to the development of a new paradigm for distributed software development; instead of pushing changes to a central repository, developers pull them from other repositories and merge them locally. Various code hosting sites, notably Github, have tapped on the opportunity to facilitate pull-based development by offering workflow support tools, such as code reviewing systems and integrated issue trackers. In this work, we explore how pull-based software development works, first on the GHTorrent corpus and then on a carefully selected sample of 291 projects. We find that the pull request model offers fast turnaround, increased opportunities for community engagement and decreased time to incorporate contributions. We show that a relatively small number of factors affect both the decision to merge a pull request and the time to process it. We also examine the reasons for pull request rejection and find that technical ones are only a small minority.",

            "Abstract": "Open source software is commonly portrayed as a meritocracy, where decisions are based solely on their technical merit. However, literature on open source suggests a complex social structure underlying the meritocracy. Social work environments such as GitHub make the relationships between users and between users and work artifacts transparent. This transparency enables developers to better use information such as technical value and social connections when making work decisions. We present a study on open source software contribution in GitHub that focuses on the task of evaluating pull requests, which are one of the primary methods for contributing code in GitHub. We analyzed the association of various technical and social measures with the likelihood of contribution acceptance. We found that project managers made use of information signaling both good technical contribution practices for a pull request and the strength of the social connection between the submitter and project manager when evaluating pull requests. Pull requests with many comments were much less likely to be accepted, moderated by the submitter&#039;s prior interaction in the project. Well-established projects were more conservative in accepting pull requests. These findings provide evidence that developers use both technical and social information when evaluating potential contributions to open source software projects.",

            "Abstract": "Web applications have become one of the fastest growing types of software systems today. Despite their popularity, understanding the behaviour of modern web applications is still a challenging endeavour for developers during development and maintenance tasks. The challenges mainly stem from the dynamic, event-driven, and asynchronous nature of the JavaScript language. We propose a generic technique for capturing low-level event-based interactions in a web application and mapping those to a higher-level behavioural model. This model is then transformed into an interactive visualization, representing episodes of triggered causal and temporal events, related JavaScript code executions, and their impact on the dynamic DOM state. Our approach, implemented in a tool called Clematis, allows developers to easily understand the complex dynamic behaviour of their application at three different semantic levels of granularity. The results of our industrial controlled experiment show that Clematis is capable of improving the task accuracy by 61%, while reducing the task completion time by 47%.",

            "Abstract": "Program comprehension is an important cognitive process that inherently eludes direct measurement. Thus, researchers are struggling with providing suitable programming languages, tools, or coding conventions to support developers in their everyday work. In this paper, we explore whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is well established in cognitive neuroscience, is feasible to soundly measure program comprehension. In a controlled experiment, we observed 17 participants inside an fMRI scanner while they were comprehending short source-code snippets, which we contrasted with locating syntax errors. We found a clear, distinct activation pattern of five brain regions, which are related to working memory, attention, and language processing---all processes that fit well to our understanding of program comprehension. Our results encourage us and, hopefully, other researchers to use fMRI in future studies to measure program comprehension and, in the long run, answer questions, such as: Can we predict whether someone will be an excellent programmer? How effective are new languages and tools for program understanding? How should we train programmers?",

Current summarization techniques work by selecting a subset of the statements and keywords from the code, and then including information from those statements and keywords in the summary. The quality of the summary depends heavily on the process of selecting the subset: a high-quality selection would contain the same statements and keywords that a programmer would choose. Unfortunately, little evidence exists about the statements and keywords that programmers view as important when they summarize source code. In this paper, we present an eye-tracking study of 10 professional Java programmers in which the programmers read Java methods and wrote English summaries of those methods. We apply the findings to build a novel summarization tool. Then, we evaluate this tool and provide evidence to support the development of source code summarization systems.",

Existing work to detect problematic software focuses mainly on post hoc identification of correlations between bug fixes and code. We propose a new approach to address this problem --- detect when software developers are experiencing difficulty while they work on their programming tasks, and stop them before they can introduce bugs into the code.  In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to classify the difficulty of code comprehension tasks using data from psycho-physiological sensors. We present the results of a study we conducted with 15 professional programmers to see how well an eye-tracker, an electrodermal activity sensor, and an electroencephalography sensor could be used to predict whether developers would find a task to be difficult. We can predict nominal task difficulty (easy/difficult) for a new developer with 64.99% precision and 64.58% recall, and for a new task with 84.38% precision and 69.79% recall. We can improve the Naive Bayes classifier&#039;s performance if we trained it on just the eye-tracking data over the entire dataset, or by using a sliding window data collection schema with a 55 second time window. Our work brings the community closer to a viable and reliable measure of task difficulty that could power the next  generation of programming support tools.",

            "Abstract": "In order to improve the quality of a software system, software defect prediction aims to automatically identify defective software modules for efficient software test. To predict software defect, those classification methods with static code attributes have attracted a great deal of attention. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been applied to defect prediction. Due to the fact that there exists the similarity among different software modules, one software module can be approximately represented by a small proportion of other modules. And the representation coefficients over the pre-defined dictionary, which consists of historical software module data, are generally sparse. In this paper, we propose to use the dictionary learning technique to predict software defect. By using the characteristics of the metrics mined from the open source software, we learn multiple dictionaries (including defective module and defective-free module sub-dictionaries and the total dictionary) and sparse representation coefficients. Moreover, we take the misclassification cost issue into account because the misclassification of defective modules generally incurs much higher risk cost than that of defective-free ones. We thus propose a cost-sensitive discriminative dictionary learning (CDDL) approach for software defect classification and prediction. The widely used datasets from NASA projects are employed as test data to evaluate the performance of all compared methods. Experimental results show that CDDL outperforms several representative state-of-the-art defect prediction methods.",

            "Abstract": "The all-important goal of delivering better software at lower cost has led to a vital, enduring quest for ways to find and remove defects efficiently and accurately. To this end, two parallel lines of research have emerged over the last years. Static analysis seeks to find defects using algorithms that process well-defined semantic abstractions of code. Statistical defect prediction uses historical data to estimate parameters of statistical formulae modeling the phenomena thought to govern defect occurrence and predict where defects are likely to occur. These two approaches have emerged from distinct intellectual traditions and have largely evolved independently, in “splendid isolation”. In this paper, we evaluate these two (largely) disparate approaches on a similar footing. We use historical defect data to apprise the two approaches, compare them, and seek synergies. We find that under some accounting principles, they provide comparable benefits; we also find that in some settings, the performance of certain static bug-finders can be enhanced using information provided by statistical defect prediction.",

            "Abstract": "The coverage of a test suite is often used as a proxy for its ability to detect faults. However, previous studies that investigated the correlation between code coverage and test suite effectiveness have failed to reach a consensus about the nature and strength of the relationship between these test suite characteristics. Moreover, many of the studies were done with small or synthetic programs, making it unclear whether their results generalize to larger programs, and some of the studies did not account for the confounding influence of test suite size. In addition, most of the studies were done with adequate suites, which are are rare in practice, so the results may not generalize to typical test suites.  We have extended these studies by evaluating the relationship between test suite size, coverage, and effectiveness for large Java programs. Our study is the largest to date in the literature: we generated 31,000 test suites for five systems consisting of up to 724,000 lines of source code. We measured the statement coverage, decision coverage, and modified condition coverage of these suites and used mutation testing to evaluate their fault detection effectiveness.  We found that there is a low to moderate correlation between coverage and effectiveness when the number of test cases in the suite is controlled for. In addition, we found that stronger forms of coverage do not provide greater insight into the effectiveness of the suite. Our results suggest that coverage, while useful for identifying under-tested parts of a program, should not be used as a quality target because it is not a good indicator of test suite effectiveness.",

            "Abstract": "Previous works using Cross-Company (CC) data for making Within-Company (WC) Software Effort Estimation (SEE) try to use CC data or models directly to provide predictions in the WC context. So, these data or models are only helpful when they match the WC context well. When they do not, a fair amount of WC training data, which are usually expensive to acquire, are still necessary to achieve good performance. We investigate how to make best use of CC data, so that we can reduce the amount of WC data while maintaining or improving performance in comparison to WC SEE models. This is done by proposing a new framework to learn the relationship between CC and WC projects explicitly, allowing CC models to be mapped to the WC context. Such mapped models can be useful even when the CC models themselves do not match the WC context directly. Our study shows that a new approach instantiating this framework is able not only to use substantially less WC data than a corresponding WC model, but also to achieve similar/better performance. This approach can also be used to provide insight into the behaviour of a company in comparison to others.",

            "Abstract": "Deterministic replay tools help programmers debug concurrent programs. However, for long-running programs, a replay tool may generate huge log of shared memory access dependences. In this paper, we present CARE, an application-level deterministic record and replay technique to reduce the log size. The key idea of CARE is logging read-write dependences only at per-thread value prediction cache misses. This strategy records only a subset of all exact read-write dependences, and reduces synchronizations protecting memory reads in the instrumented code. Realizing that such record strategy provides only value-deterministic replay, CARE also adopts variable grouping and action prioritization heuristics to synthesize sequentially consistent executions at replay in linear time. We implemented CARE in Java and experimentally evaluated it with recognized benchmarks. Results showed that CARE successfully resolved all missing read-write dependences, producing sequentially consistent replay for all benchmarks. CARE exhibited 1.7--40X (median 3.4X) smaller runtime overhead, and 1.1--309X (median 7.0X) smaller log size against state-of-the-art technique LEAP.",

            "Abstract": "Concurrent systems are notoriously difficult to debug and understand. A common way of gaining insight into system behavior is to inspect execution logs and documentation. Unfortunately, manual inspection of logs is an arduous process, and documentation is often incomplete and out of sync with the implementation.  To provide developers with more insight into concurrent systems, we developed CSight. CSight mines logs of a system&#039;s executions to infer a concise and accurate model of that system&#039;s behavior, in the form of a communicating finite state machine (CFSM).  Engineers can use the inferred CFSM model to understand complex behavior, detect anomalies, debug, and increase confidence in the correctness of their implementations. CSight&#039;s only requirement is that the logged events have vector timestamps. We provide a tool that automatically adds vector timestamps to system logs. Our tool prototypes are available at http://synoptic.googlecode.com/.  This paper presents algorithms for inferring CFSM models from traces of concurrent systems, proves them correct, provides an implementation, and evaluates the implementation in two ways: by running it on logs from three different networked systems and via a user study that focused on bug finding. Our evaluation finds that CSight infers accurate models that can help developers find bugs.",

The coarse-grained locking disallows the concurrent accesses to the entire data structure and leads to a low degree of concurrency. We propose an approach, built upon the Multiple Granularity Lock (MGL), that replaces the coarse-grained locks to unleash more concurrency for irregular data structures. Our approach is widely applicable and does not require the data structures to have special shapes. We produce the MGL locks through reasoning about the hierarchy of the data structure and the accesses to it. According to the evaluation results on widely used applications, our optimization brings the significant speedup, e.g., at least 7%-20% speedup and up to 2X speedup.",

            "Abstract": "Many predictive deadlock detection techniques analyze multithreaded programs to suggest potential deadlocks (referred to as cycles or deadlock warnings). Nonetheless, many of such cycles are false positives. On checking these cycles, existing dynamic deadlock confirmation techniques may frequently encounter thrashing or result in a low confirmation probability. This paper presents a novel technique entitled ConLock to address these problems. ConLock firstly analyzes a given cycle and the execution trace that produces the cycle. It identifies a set of thread scheduling constraints based on a novel should-happen-before relation. ConLock then manipulates a confirmation run with the aim to not violate a reduced set of scheduling constraints and to trigger an occurrence of the deadlock if the cycle is a real deadlock. If the cycle is a false positive, ConLock reports scheduling violations. We have validated ConLock using a suite of real-world programs with 11 deadlocks. The result shows that among all 741 cycles reported by Magiclock, ConLock confirms all 11 deadlocks with a probability of 71%−100%. On the remaining 730 cycles, ConLock reports scheduling violations on each. We have systematically sampled 87 out of the 730 cycles and confirmed that all these cycles are false positives.",

            "Abstract": "Reducing the energy usage of software is becoming more important in many environments, in particular, battery-powered mobile devices, embedded systems and data centers. Recent empirical studies indicate that software engineers can support the goal of reducing energy usage by making design and implementation decisions in ways that take into consideration how such decisions impact the energy usage of an application. However, the large number of possible choices and the lack of feedback and information available to software engineers necessitates some form of automated decision-making support. This paper describes the first known automated support for systematically optimizing the energy usage of applications by making code-level changes. It is effective at reducing energy usage while freeing developers from needing to deal with the low-level, tedious tasks of applying changes and monitoring the resulting impacts to the energy usage of their application. We present a general framework, SEEDS, as well as an instantiation of the framework that automatically optimizes Java applications by selecting the most energy-efficient library implementations for Java&#039;s Collections API. Our empirical evaluation of the framework and instantiation show that it is possible to improve the energy usage of an application in a fully automated manner for a reasonable cost.",

            "Abstract": "Energy-efficiency is a key concern in continuously-running mobile applications, such as those for health and context monitoring. Unfortunately, developers must implement complex and customized power-management policies for each application. This involves the use of complex primitives and writing error-prone multithreaded code to monitor hardware state. To address this problem, we present APE, an annotation language and middleware service that eases the development of energy-efficient Android applications. APE annotations are used to demarcate a power-hungry code segment whose execution is deferred until the device enters a state that minimizes the cost of that operation. The execution of power-hungry operations is coordinated across applications by the APE middleware. Several examples show the expressive power of our approach. A case study of using APE annotations in a real mobile sensing application shows that annotations can cleanly specify a power management policy and reduce the complexity of its implementation. An empirical evaluation of the middleware shows that APE introduces negligible overhead and equals hand-tuned code in energy savings, in this case achieving 63.4% energy savings compared to the case when there is no coordination.",

MicroX is a first prototype VM allowing micro execution of x86 binary code. No test driver, no input data, no source code, no debug symbols are required: MicroX automatically discovers dynamically the Input/Output interface of the code being run. Input values are provided as needed along the execution and can be generated in various ways, e.g., randomly or using some other test-generation tool.

Test Suite Minimization reduces the number of tests in a suite by removing tests that appear redundant, at the risk of a reduction in fault-finding ability since it can be difficult to identify which tests are truly redundant. We take a completely different approach to solving the same problem of long running test suites by instead reducing the time needed to execute each test, an approach that we call Unit Test Virtualization. With Unit Test Virtualization, we reduce the overhead of isolating each unit test with a lightweight virtualization container. We describe the empirical analysis that grounds our approach and provide an implementation of Unit Test Virtualization targeting Java applications. We evaluated our implementation, VMVM, using 20 real-world Java applications and found that it reduces test suite execution time by up to 97% (on average, 62%) when compared to traditional unit test execution. We also compared VMVM to a well known Test Suite Minimization technique, finding the reduction provided by VMVM to be four times greater, while still executing every test with no loss of fault-finding ability.",

However, models usually approximate part of the program semantics and capture only some of the relevant dependencies and constraints. As a consequence, some of the test cases that are derived from models are infeasible.  In this paper, we propose a method, based on the computation of the N-gram statistics, to increase the likelihood of deriving feasible test cases from a model. Correspondingly, the level of model coverage is also expected to increase, because infeasible test cases do not contribute to coverage. While N-grams do improve existing test case derivation methods, they show limitations when the N-gram statistics is incomplete, which is expected to necessarily occur as N increases. Interpolated N-grams overcome such limitation and show the highest performance of all test case derivation methods compared in this work.",

            "Abstract": "Failed error propagation (FEP) is known to hamper software testing, yet it remains poorly understood. We introduce an information theoretic formulation of FEP that is based on measures of conditional entropy. This formulation considers the situation in which we are interested in the potential for an incorrect program state at statement s to fail to propagate to incorrect output. We define five metrics that differ in two ways: whether we only consider parts of the program that can be reached after executing s and whether we restrict attention to a single program path of interest .We give the results of experiments in which it was found that on average one in 10 tests suffered from FEP, earlier studies having shown that this figure can vary significantly between programs. The experiments also showed that our metrics are well-correlated with FEP. Our empirical study involved 30 programs, for which we executed a total of 7,140,000 test cases. The results reveal that the metrics differ in their performance but the Spearman rank correlation with failed error propagation is close to 0.95 for two of the metrics. These strong correlations in an experimental setting, in which all information about both FEP and conditional entropy is known, open up the possibility in the longer term of devising inexpensive information theory based metrics that allow us to minimise the effect of FEP.",

            "Abstract": "Mainstream programming languages provide built-in exception handling mechanisms to support robust and maintainable implementation of exception handling in software systems. Most of these modern languages, such as C#, Ruby, Python and many others, are often claimed to have more appropriated exception handling mechanisms. They reduce programming constraints on exception handling to favor agile changes in the source code. These languages provide what we call maintenance-driven exception handling mechanisms. It is expected that the adoption of these mechanisms improve software maintainability without hindering software robustness. However, there is still little empirical knowledge about the impact that adopting these mechanisms have on software robustness. This paper addressed this gap by conducting an empirical study aimed at understanding the relationship between changes in C# programs and their robustness. In particular, we evaluated how changes in the normal and exceptional code were related to exception handling faults. We applied a change impact analysis and a control flow analysis in 119 versions of 16 C# programs. The results showed that: (i) most of the problems hindering software robustness in those programs are caused by changes in the normal code, (ii) many potential faults were introduced even when improving exception handling in C# code, and (iii) faults are often facilitated by the maintenance-driven flexibility of the exception handling mechanism. Moreover, we present a series of change scenarios that decrease the program robustness.",

            "Abstract": "Contracts are a popular tool for specifying the functional behavior of software. This paper characterizes the contracts that developers write, the contracts that developers could write, and how a developer reacts when shown the difference.  This paper makes three research contributions based on an investigation of open-source projects&#039; use of Code Contracts. First, we characterize Code Contract usage in practice. For example, approximately three-fourths of the Code Contracts are basic checks for the presence of data. We discuss similarities and differences in usage across the projects, and we identify annotation burden, tool support, and training as possible explanations based on developer interviews. Second, based on contracts automatically inferred for four of the projects, we find that developers underutilize contracts for expressing state updates, object state indicators, and conditional properties. Third, we performed user studies to learn how developers decide which contracts to enforce. The developers used contract suggestions to support their existing use cases with more expressive contracts. However, the suggestions did not lead them to experiment with other use cases for which contracts are better-suited.  In support of the research contributions, the paper presents two engineering contributions: (1) Celeriac, a tool for generating traces of .NET programs compatible with the Daikon invariant detection tool, and (2) Contract Inserter, a Visual Studio add-in for discovering and inserting likely invariants as Code Contracts.",

            "Abstract": "Program invariants are important for defect detection, program verification, and program repair. However, existing techniques have limited support for important classes of invariants such as disjunctions, which express the semantics of conditional statements. We propose a method for generating disjunctive invariants over numerical domains, which are inexpressible using classical convex polyhedra. Using dynamic analysis and reformulating the problem in non-standard ``max-plus&#039;&#039; and ``min-plus&#039;&#039; algebras, our method constructs hulls over program trace points. Critically, we introduce and infer a weak class of such invariants that balances expressive power against the computational cost of generating nonconvex shapes in high dimensions.  Existing dynamic inference techniques often generate spurious invariants that fit some program traces but do not generalize. With the insight that generating dynamic invariants is easy, we propose to verify these invariants statically using k-inductive SMT theorem proving which allows us to validate invariants that are not classically inductive.  Results on difficult kernels involving nonlinear arithmetic and abstract arrays suggest that this hybrid approach efficiently generates and proves correct program invariants.",

A key issue in dependability of these applications is the correctness of the actions that update the data store, which are triggered by user requests. In this paper, we present techniques for au- tomatically checking if the actions of an application preserve the data model invariants. Our approach first automatically extracts a data model specification, which we call an abstract data store, from a given application using instrumented exe- cution. The abstract data store identifies the sets of objects and relations (associations) used by the application, and the actions that update the data store by deleting or creating objects or by changing the relations among the objects. We show that checking invariants of an abstract data store corre- sponds to inductive invariant verification, and can be done using a mapping to First Order Logic (FOL) and using a FOL theorem prover. We implemented this approach for the Rails framework and applied it to three open source applications. We found four previously unknown bugs and reported them to the developers, who confirmed and imme- diately fixed two of them.",

In previous studies, we reported evidence indicating that static type systems acted as a form of implicit documentation, benefiting developer productivity. Such implicit documentation is easier to maintain, given it is enforced by the compiler, but previous experiments tested users without any explicit documentation. In this paper, we report on a controlled experiment and an exploratory study comparing the impact of using documentation and a static or dynamic type system on a development task. Results of our study both confirm previous findings and show that the benefits of static typing are strengthened with explicit documentation, but that this was not as strongly felt with dynamically typed languages.",

However, this abstraction does not come for free: understanding how to use an API can be difficult. While API documentation can help, it is often insufficient on its own. Online sites like Stack Overflow and Github Gists have grown to fill the gap between traditional API documentation and more example-based resources. Unfortunately, these two important classes of documentation are independent.  In this paper we describe an iterative, deductive method of linking source code examples to API documentation. We also present an implementation of this method, called Baker, that is highly precise (0.97) and supports both Java and JavaScript. Baker can be used to enhance traditional API documentation with up-to-date source code examples; it can also be used to incorporate links to the API documentation into the code snippets that use the API.",

Earlier studies have shown that existing code search engines are not successful in finding working code examples. They fail in ranking high quality code examples at the top of the result set. To address this shortcoming, a variety of pattern-based solutions are proposed in the literature. However, these solutions cannot be integrated seamlessly in Internet-scale source code engines due to their high time complexity or query language restrictions. In this paper, we propose an approach for spotting working code examples which can be adopted by Internet-scale source code search engines. The time complexity of our approach is as low as the complexity of existing code search engines on the Internet and considerably lower than the pattern-based approaches supporting free-form queries. We study the performance of our approach using a representative corpus of 25,000 open source Java projects. Our findings support the feasibility of our approach for Internet-scale code search. We also found that our approach outperforms Ohloh Code search engine, previously known as Koders, in spotting working code examples.",

            "Abstract": "A self-adaptive system uses runtime models to adapt its architecture to the changing requirements and contexts. However, there is no one-to-one mapping between the requirements in the problem space and the architectural elements in the solution space. Instead, one refined requirement may crosscut multiple architectural elements, and its realization involves complex behavioral or structural interactions manifested as architectural design decisions. In this paper we propose to combine two kinds of self-adaptations: requirements-driven self-adaptation, which captures requirements as goal models to reason about the best plan within the problem space, and architecture-based self-adaptation, which captures architectural design decisions as decision trees to search for the best design for the desired requirements within the contextualized solution space. Following these adaptations, component-based architecture models are reconfigured using incremental and generative model transformations. Compared with requirements-driven or architecture-based approaches, the case study using an online shopping benchmark shows promise that our approach can further improve the effectiveness of adaptation (e.g. system throughput in this case study) and offer more adaptation flexibility.",

            "Abstract": "Most approaches for adaptive systems rely on models, particularly behaviour or architecture models, which describe the system and the environment in which it operates. One of the difficulties in creating such models is uncertainty about the accuracy and completeness of the models. Engineers therefore make assumptions which may prove to be invalid at runtime. In this paper we introduce a rigorous, tiered framework for combining behaviour models, each with different associated assumptions and risks. These models are used to generate operational strategies, through techniques such controller synthesis, which are then executed concurrently at runtime. We show that our framework can be used to adapt the functional behaviour of the system: through graceful degradation when the assumptions of a higher level model are broken, and through progressive enhancement when those assumptions are satisfied or restored.",

Variations are simultaneously happening both at the cloud infrastructure level - for example hardware failures - and at the user workload level - flash crowds. However, robustly withstanding extreme variability, requires costly hardware over-provisioning.  In this paper, we introduce a self-adaptation programming paradigm called brownout. Using this paradigm, applications can be designed to robustly withstand unpredictable runtime variations, without over-provisioning. The paradigm is based on optional code that can be dynamically deactivated through decisions based on control theory.  We modified two popular web application prototypes - RUBiS and RUBBoS - with less than 170 lines of code, to make them brownout-compliant. Experiments show that brownout self-adaptation dramatically improves the ability to withstand flash-crowds and hardware failures.",

Therefore, a method is needed for integrating adaptive UI capabilities into these systems without incurring a high cost or significantly disrupting the way they function. This paper presents a method for integrating adaptive UI behavior in enterprise applications based on CEDAR, a model-driven, service-oriented, and tool-supported architecture for devising adaptive enterprise application UIs. The proposed integration method is evaluated with a case study, which includes establishing and applying technical metrics to measure several of the method’s properties using the open-source enterprise application OFBiz as a test-case. The generality and flexibility of the integration method are also evaluated based on an interview and discussions with practitioners about their real-life projects.",

            "Abstract": "Package management as a means of reuse of software artifacts has become extremely popular, most notably in Linux distributions. At the same time, successful package management brings about a number of computational challenges. Whenever a user requires a new package to be installed, a package manager not only installs the new package but it might also install other packages or uninstall some old ones in order to respect dependencies and conflicts of the packages. Coming up with a new configuration of packages is computationally challenging. It is in particular complex when we also wish to optimize for user preferences, such as that the resulting package configuration should not differ too much from the original one. A number of exact approaches for solving this problem have been proposed in recent years. These approaches, however, do not have guaranteed runtime due to the high computational complexity of the problem. This paper addresses this issue by devising a hybrid approach that integrates exact solving with approximate solving by invoking the approximate part whenever the solver is running out of time. Experimental evaluation shows that this approach enables returning high-quality package configurations with rapid response time.",

We analyze this corpus to find uses of new Java language features over time.

In JavaScript (JS) Web applications, JS usage patterns in their source code have special characteristics that pose challenges in pattern mining. They involve nested data objects with no corresponding names or types. JS functions can be also used as data objects. JS usages are often cross-language, inter-procedural, and involve control and data flow dependencies among JS program entities and data objects whose data types are revealed only at run time due to dynamic typing in JS. This paper presents JSModel, a novel graph-based representation for JS usages, and JSMiner, a scalable approach to mine inter-procedural, data-oriented JS usage patterns. Our empirical evaluation on several Web programs shows that JSMiner efficiently detects more JS patterns with higher accuracy than a state-of-the-art approach.

            "Abstract": "Identifying repetitive code changes benefits developers, tool builders, and researchers. Tool builders can automate the popular code changes, thus improving the productivity of developers. Researchers can better understand the practice of code evolution, advancing existing code assistance tools and benefiting developers even further. Unfortunately, existing research either predominantly uses coarse-grained Version Control System (VCS) snapshots as the primary source of code evolution data or considers only a small subset of program transformations of a single kind - refactorings.  We present the first approach that identifies previously unknown frequent code change patterns from a fine-grained sequence of code changes. Our novel algorithm effectively handles challenges that distinguish continuous code change pattern mining from the existing data mining techniques. We evaluated our algorithm on 1,520 hours of code development collected from 23 developers, and showed that it is effective, useful, and scales to large amounts of data. We analyzed some of the mined code change patterns and discovered ten popular kinds of high-level program transformations. More than half of our 420 survey participants acknowledged that eight out of ten transformations are relevant to their programming activities.",

            "Abstract": "This paper expands staleness-based memory leak detection by presenting a machine learning-based framework. The proposed framework is based on an idea that object staleness can be better leveraged in regard to similarity of objects; i.e., an object is more likely to have leaked if it shows significantly high staleness not observed from other similar objects with the same allocation context.  A central part of the proposed framework is the modeling of heap objects. To this end, the framework observes the staleness of objects during a representative run of an application. From the observed data, the framework generates training examples, which also contain instances of hypothetical leaks. Via machine learning, the proposed framework replaces the error-prone user-definable staleness predicates used in previous research with a model-based prediction.  The framework was tested using both synthetic and real-world examples. Evaluation with synthetic leakage workloads of SPEC2006 benchmarks shows that the proposed method achieves the optimal accuracy permitted by staleness-based leak detection. Moreover, by incorporating allocation context into the model, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than is possible with object staleness alone. Evaluation with real-world memory leaks demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for detecting previously reported bugs with high accuracy.",

To track the staleness of allocated memory (which is a clue to potential leaks) with little overhead (mostly &lt;3%), Sniper leverages instruction sampling using performance monitoring units available in commodity processors. It also offloads the time- and space-consuming analyses, and works on the original software without modifying the underlying memory allocator; it neither perturbs the application execution nor increases the heap size. The Sniper can even deal with multithreaded applications with very low overhead. In particular, it performs a statistical analysis, which views memory leaks as anomalies, for automated and systematic leak determination. Consequently, it accurately detected real-world memory leaks with no false positive, and achieved an F-measure of 81% on average for 17 benchmarks stress-tested with various memory leaks.",

            "Abstract": "JavaScript is used in web applications for achieving rich user interfaces and implementing core functionality. Unfortunately, JavaScript code is known to be prone to faults. In an earlier study, we found that over 65% of such faults are caused by the interaction of JavaScript code with the DOM at runtime (DOM-related faults). In this paper, we first perform an analysis of 190 bug reports to understand fixes commonly applied by programmers to these DOM-related faults; we observe that parameter replacements and DOM element validations are common fix categories. Based on these findings, we propose an automated technique and tool, called Vejovis, for suggesting repairs for DOM-based JavaScript faults. To evaluate Vejovis, we conduct a case study in which we subject Vejovis to 22 real-world bugs across 11 applications. We find that Vejovis accurately suggests repairs for 20 out of the 22 bugs, and in 13 of the 20 cases, the correct fix was the top ranked one.",

Spreadsheet cells whose computation is subject to the same semantics are often clustered in a row or column. When a spreadsheet evolves, these cell clusters can degenerate due to ad hoc modifications or undisciplined copy-and-pastes. Such degenerated clusters no longer keep cells prescribing the same computational semantics, and are said to exhibit ambiguous computation smells. Our empirical study finds that such smells are common and likely harmful. We propose AmCheck, a novel technique that automatically detects and repairs ambiguous computation smells by recovering their intended computational semantics. A case study using AmCheck suggests that it is useful for discovering and repairing real spreadsheet problems.",

However, only a little is known about how users and developers perceive privacy and which concrete measures would mitigate their privacy concerns. To investigate privacy requirements, we conducted an online survey with closed and open questions and collected 408 valid responses. Our results show that users often reduce privacy to security, with data sharing and data breaches being their biggest concerns. Users are more concerned about the content of their documents and their personal data such as location than about their interaction data. Unlike users, developers clearly prefer technical measures like data anonymization and think that privacy laws and policies are less effective. We also observed interesting differences between people from different geographies. For example, people from Europe are more concerned about data breaches than people from North America. People from Asia/Pacific and Europe believe that content and metadata are more critical for privacy than people from North America. Our results contribute to developing a user-driven privacy framework that is based on empirical evidence in addition to the legal, technical, and commercial perspectives.",

            "Abstract": "As mobile computing applications have become commonplace, it is increasingly important for them to address end-users’ privacy requirements. Privacy requirements depend on a number of contextual socio-cultural factors to which mobility adds another level of contextual variation. However, traditional requirements elicitation methods do not sufficiently account for contextual factors and therefore cannot be used effectively to represent and analyse the privacy requirements of mobile end users. On the other hand, methods that do investigate contextual factors tend to produce data that does not lend itself to the process of requirements extraction. To address this problem we have developed a Privacy Requirements Distillation approach that employs a problem analysis framework to extract and refine privacy requirements for mobile applications from raw data gathered through empirical studies involving end users. Our approach introduces privacy facets that capture patterns of privacy concerns which are matched against the raw data. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach using qualitative data from an empirical study of a mobile social networking application.",

We present a systematic method allowing software architects to describe uncertainty about the impact of alternatives on stakeholders&#039; goals; to calculate the consequences of uncertainty through Monte-Carlo simulation; to shortlist candidate architectures based on expected costs, benefits and risks; and to assess the value of obtaining additional information before deciding. We demonstrate our method on the design of a system for coordinating emergency response teams.

However, little research has addressed the relationship between design creativity and the way requirements are framed or presented. This paper therefore aims to investigate the possibility that the way desiderata are framed or presented can affect design creativity. Forty two participants took part in a randomized control trial where one group received desiderata framed as “requirements” while the other received desiderata framed as “ideas”. Participants produced design concepts which were judged for originality. Participants who received requirements framing produced significantly less original designs than participants who received ideas framing (Mann-Whitney U=116.5, p=0.004). We conclude that framing desiderata as “requirements” may cause requirements fixation where designers’ preoccupation with satisfying explicit requirements inhibits their creativity.",

It is highly challenging to detect plugin conflicts due to the exponential explosion of the combinations of plugins (i.e., configurations). In this paper, we address the challenge of executing a test case over many configurations. Leveraging the fact that many executions of a test are similar, our variability-aware execution runs common code once. Only when encountering values that are different depending on specific configurations will the execution split to run for each of them. To evaluate the scalability of variability-aware execution on a large real-world setting, we built a prototype PHP interpreter called Varex and ran it on the popular WordPress blogging Web application. The results show that while plugin interactions exist, there is a significant amount of sharing that allows variability-aware execution to scale to 2^50 configurations within seven minutes of running time. During our study, with Varex, we were able to detect two plugin conflicts: one was recently reported on WordPress forum and another one was not previously discovered.",

            "Abstract": "Though mutation testing has been widely studied for more than thirty years, the prevalence and properties of equivalent mutants remain largely unknown. We report on the causes and prevalence of equivalent mutants and their relationship to stubborn mutants (those that remain undetected by a high quality test suite, yet are non-equivalent). Our results, based on manual analysis of 1,230 mutants from 18 programs, reveal a highly uneven distribution of equivalence and stubbornness. For example, the ABS class and half UOI class generate many equivalent and almost no stubborn mutants, while the LCR class generates many stubborn and few equivalent mutants. We conclude that previous test effectiveness studies based on fault seeding could be skewed, while developers of mutation testing tools should prioritise those operators that we found generate disproportionately many stubborn (and few equivalent) mutants.",

            "Abstract": "Despite the recent advances in automatic test generation, testers must still write test oracles manually. If formal specifications are available, it might be possible to use decision procedures derived from those specifications. We present a technique that is based on a form of specification but also leverages more information from the system under test. We assume that the system under test is somewhat redundant, in the sense that some operations are designed to behave like others but their executions are different. Our experience in this and previous work indicates that this redundancy exists and is easily documented. We then generate oracles by cross-checking the execution of a test with the same test in which we replace some operations with redundant ones. We develop this notion of cross-checking oracles into a generic technique to automatically insert oracles into unit tests. An experimental evaluation shows that cross-checking oracles, used in combination with automatic test generation techniques, can be very effective in revealing faults, and that they can even improve good hand-written test suites.",

In practice, there is a gap between what is prescribed by guidelines and what is implemented in practice, making it difficult for organizations and certifiers to fully evaluate the safety of the software system. In this paper we present an approach, which parses a guideline to extract a Traceability Model depicting software artifact types and their prescribed traces. It then analyzes the traceability data within a project to identify areas of traceability failure. Missing traceability paths, redundant and/or inconsistent data, and other problems are highlighted. We used our approach to evaluate the traceability of seven safety-critical software systems and found that none of the evaluated projects contained traceability that fully conformed to its relevant guidelines.",

With the introduction of variable features in configurable systems, dependencies may even cross feature boundaries, causing problems that are prone to be detected late. Many current implementation techniques for product lines lack proper interfaces, which could make such dependencies explicit. As alternative to changing the implementation approach, we provide a tool-based solution to support developers in recognizing and dealing with feature dependencies: emergent interfaces. Emergent interfaces are inferred on demand, based on feature-sensitive intraprocedural and interprocedural data-flow analysis. They emerge in the IDE and emulate modularity benefits not available in the host language. To evaluate the potential of emergent interfaces, we conducted and replicated a controlled experiment, and found, in the studied context, that emergent interfaces can improve performance of code change tasks by up to 3 times while also reducing the number of errors.",

Considering evolutionary coupling as a special type of relationship, we investigated (1) whether design rule spaces can reveal structural relations among error-prone files; (2) whether design rule spaces can reveal structural problems contributing to error-proneness.We studied three large-scale open source projects and found that error-prone files can be captured by just a few design rule sub-spaces. Supported by our tool, Titan, we are able to flexibly visualize design rule spaces formed by different types of relationships, including evolutionary dependencies. This way, we are not only able to visualize which error-prone files belong to which design rule spaces, but also to visualize the structural problems that give insight into why these files are error prone. Design rule spaces provide valuable direction on which parts of the architecture are problematic, and on why, when, and how to refactor.",

            "Abstract": "As modeling in software and system development becomes increasingly prevalent, many engineers need to collaboratively develop models spanning many disciplines such as requirements management, system design, software, etc. However, integrating modeling languages for various disciplines is challenging, because UML and SysML are too complex for many engineers to understand. Therefore, in complicated engineering processes, engineers with different areas of expertise often find it difficult to access the same information in different domain-specific modeling environments.  Our approach to address this problem is to share and edit the models as task-oriented spreadsheets, using a unified model (in UML or SysML) and a unified user interface (in the spreadsheet program). The formats of the spreadsheets are optimized for various tasks while the target models remain in a unified modeling language. Since the transformation between the spreadsheets and the models is automated and transparent, users do not have to be skilled with the modeling languages to edit the spreadsheets.  Using our novel approach, we were able to reduce the errors and time, and also the difficulty for each task without providing specialized training for the engineers. A preliminary user study showed that, by applying the spreadsheet-based approach, we could reduce the number of errors with less time for typical systems engineering tasks.",

We conducted the experiment with 26 graduate and undergraduate students from electrical and computer engineering (ECE), computer science (CS), and software engineering (SE) programs at the University of Waterloo. The experiment involves a domain model, with UML class diagrams representing the domain abstractions and UML object diagrams representing examples of using these abstractions. The goal is to provide empirical evidence of the effects of suitable examples in model comprehension, compared to having model abstractions only, by having the participants perform model comprehension tasks. Our results show that EDM is superior to having model abstractions only, with an improvement of 39% for diagram completeness, 30% for questions completeness, 71% for efficiency, and a reduction of 80% for the number of mistakes. We provide qualitative results showing that participants receiving model abstractions augmented with examples experienced lower perceived difficulty in performing the comprehension tasks, higher perceived confidence in their tasks&#039; solutions, and asked fewer clarifying domain questions, a reduction of 90%. We also present participants&#039; feedback regarding the usefulness of the provided examples, their number and types, as well as, the use of partial examples.",

            "Abstract": "Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) provides developers a conceptual abstraction for mapping the application code to the underlying databases. ORM is widely used in industry due to its convenience; permitting developers to focus on developing the business logic without worrying too much about the database access details. However, developers often write ORM code without considering the impact of such code on database performance, leading to cause transactions with timeouts or hangs in large-scale systems. Unfortunately, there is little support to help developers automatically detect suboptimal database accesses. In this paper, we propose an automated framework to detect ORM performance anti-patterns. Our framework automatically flags performance anti-patterns in the source code. Furthermore, as there could be hundreds or even thousands of instances of anti-patterns, our framework provides sup- port to prioritize performance bug fixes based on a statistically rigorous performance assessment. We have successfully evaluated our framework on two open source and one large-scale industrial systems. Our case studies show that our framework can detect new and known real-world performance bugs and that fixing the detected performance anti- patterns can improve the system response time by up to 98%.",

However, many smartphone applications suffer from bugs that cause significant performance degradation, thereby losing their competitive edge. Unfortunately, people have little understanding of these performance bugs. They also lack effective techniques to fight with such bugs. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study of 70 real-world performance bugs collected from eight large-scale and popular Android applications. We studied the characteristics (e.g., bug types and how they manifested) of these bugs and identified their common patterns. These findings can support follow-up research on performance bug avoidance, testing, debugging and analysis for smartphone applications. To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we implemented a static code analyzer, PerfChecker, to detect our identified performance bug patterns. We experimentally evaluated PerfChecker by applying it to 29 popular Android applications, which comprise 1.1 million lines of Java code. PerfChecker successfully detected 126 matching instances of our performance bug patterns. Among them, 68 were quickly confirmed by developers as previously-unknown issues that affect application performance, and 20 were fixed soon afterwards by following our optimization suggestions.",

The open nature of Android allows users to install miscellaneous applications, including the malicious ones, from third-party marketplaces without rigorous sanity checks. A large portion of existing malwares perform stealthy operations such as sending short messages, making phone calls and HTTP connections, and installing additional malicious components. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to detect such stealthy behavior. We model stealthy behavior as the program behavior that mismatches with user interface, which denotes the user&#039;s expectation of program behavior. We use static program analysis to attribute a top level function that is usually a user interaction function with the behavior it performs. Then we analyze the text extracted from the user interface component associated with the top level function. Semantic mismatch of the two indicates stealthy behavior. To evaluate AsDroid, we download a pool of 182 apps that are potentially problematic by looking at their permissions. Among the 182 apps, AsDroid reports stealthy behaviors in 113 apps, with 28 false positives and 11 false negatives.",

            "Abstract": "Software development is inherently incremental; however, it is challenging to correctly introduce changes on top of existing code. Recent studies show that 15%-24% of the bug fixes are incorrect, and the most important yet hard-to-acquire information for programming changes is whether this change breaks any code elsewhere. This paper presents a framework, called Hydrogen, for patch verification. Hydrogen aims to automatically determine whether a patch correctly fixes a bug, a new bug is introduced in the change, a bug can impact multiple software releases, and the patch is applicable for all the impacted releases. Hydrogen consists of a novel program representation, namely multiversion interprocedural control flow graph (MVICFG), that integrates and compares control flow of multiple versions of programs, and a demand-driven, path-sensitive symbolic analysis that traverses the MVICFG for detecting bugs related to software changes and versions. In this paper, we present the definition, construction and applications of MVICFGs. Our experimental results show that Hydrogen correctly builds desired MVICFGs and is scalable to real-life programs such as libpng, tightvnc and putty. We experimentally demonstrate that MVICFGs can enable efficient patch verification. Using the results generated by Hydrogen, we have found a few documentation errors related to patches for a set of open-source programs.",

Specifically, iProperty aims to reduce the cost of checking properties as they are initially developed and as they co-evolve with the program. The key novelty of iProperty is to compute the differences between the new and old versions of expected properties to reduce the number and size of the properties that need to be checked during the initial development of the properties. Furthermore, property differencing is used in synergy with program behavior differencing techniques to optimize common regression scenarios, such as detecting regression errors or checking feature additions for conformance to new expected properties. Experimental results in the context of symbolic execution of Java programs annotated with properties written as assertions show the effectiveness of iProperty in utilizing change information to enable more efficient checking.",

Symbolic model checking explores many states simultaneously and reports numerous erroneous traces. Automated assume-guarantee reasoning, on the other hand, infers contextual assumptions by inspecting spurious erroneous traces. One would expect that their integration could further improve the capacity of model checking. Yet examining numerous erroneous traces to deduce contextual assumptions can be very time-consuming. The integration of symbolic model checking and assume-guarantee reasoning is thus far from clear. In this paper, we present a progressive witness analysis algorithm for automated assume-guarantee reasoning to exploit a multitude of traces from BDD-based symbolic model checkers. Our technique successfully integrates symbolic model checking with automated assume-guarantee reasoning by directly inferring BDD&#039;s as implicit assumptions. It outperforms monolithic symbolic model checking in four benchmark problems and an industrial case study in experiments.",

Refactoring tools can automatically perform and check the correctness of refactorings.

To address this problem, we propose a technique called GhostFactor separating transformation and correctness checking: we allow the developer to transform code manually, but check the correctness of her transformation automatically. We implemented our technique as a Visual Studio plugin, then evaluated it with a human study of eight software developers; GhostFactor improved the correctness of manual refactorings by 67%.",

Recent studies have applied traditional usability testing methodologies such as surveys, lab studies, and interviews to find the usability problems of refactoring tools. However, these methodologies can identify only certain kinds of usability problems. The critical incident technique (CIT) is a general methodology that uncovers usability problems by analyzing troubling user interactions. We adapt CIT to refactoring tools and show that alternate refactoring paths are indicators of the usability problems of refactoring tools. We define an alternate refactoring path as a sequence of user interactions that contains cancellations, reported messages, or repeated invocations of the refactoring tool. We evaluated our method on a large corpus of refactoring usage data, which we collected during a field study on 36 programmers over three months. This method revealed 15 usability problems, 13 of which were previously unknown. We reported these problems and proposed design improvements to Eclipse developers. The developers acknowledged all of the problems and have already fixed four of them. This result suggests that analyzing alternate paths is effective at discovering the usability problems of interactive program transformation (IPT) tools.",

Using this data, we answer 2 research questions about use and misuse of asynchronous constructs. Inspired by these findings, we developed (i) Asyncifier, an automated refactoring tool that converts callback-based asynchronous code to use async/await; (ii) Corrector, a tool that finds and corrects common misuses of async/await.

The modularity strategy establishes design rules that fix module functionality and interfaces, and assigns development work for each module to a single team. The modules present relatively independent coordination problems that teams attempt to solve with all the traditional coordination mechanisms available to them. The applicability and effectiveness of this strategy is limited with increasing technical and organizational volatility. In the absence of theory explaining why and when modularity works, the technique is brittle, with very little firm basis for adjustment or for complementing it with other strategies.  I present a theory of coordination, based on decision networks, that generalizes the modularity strategy. I review evidence testing several hypotheses derived from the theory, and explore how this theoretical view can drive coordination research and provide a theoretical basis for practical techniques to assist architects, developers, and managers.",

We tested an idea with industrial software developers that adding game-like feedback to the development environment would improve adoption of tools and practices for code navigation. We present results from a pre-study survey of 130 developers&#039; opinions on gamification and motivation, usage data from a study with an intact team of six developers of a game on code navigation practices, and feedback collected in post-study interviews. Our pre-study survey showed that most developers were interested in gamification, though some have strong negative opinions. Study results show that two of the six study developers adjusted their practices when presented with competitive game elements.",

This turn of events has led to a veritable gold rush, as researchers attempt to mine raw data and extract nuggets of insight. A very real danger is that the landscape may become a Wild West where inexperienced software &quot;cowboys&quot; sell hastily generated models to unsophisticated business users, without any concern for best or safe practices. Given the current enthusiasm for data analysis in software engineering, it is time to review how we using those techniques and can we use them better. While there may be no single best &quot;right&quot; way to analyze software data, there are many wrong ways. As data techniques mature, we need to move to a new era where data scientists understand and share the strengths and drawbacks of the many methods that might be deployed in industry. In this highly interactive panel skilled practitioners and academics can (a) broadcast their insights and (b) hear the issues of newcomers in this field.",

HTML is not just created on the server, but manipulated extensively within the browser through JavaScript code. In this paper, we seek to understand the software engineering implications of this. We look at deviations from many known best practices in such areas of performance, accessibility, and correct structuring of HTML documents. Furthermore, we assess to what extent such deviations manifest themselves through client-side code manipulation only. To answer these questions, we conducted a large scale experiment, involving automated client-enabled crawling of over 4000 web applications, resulting in over 100,000,000 pages analyzed, and close to 1,000,000 unique client-side user interface states. Our findings show that the majority of sites contain a substantial number of problems, making sites unnecessarily slow, inaccessible for the visually impaired, and with layout that is unpredictable due to errors in the dynamically modified DOM trees.",

Events log collected over 283 days of in-field operation are used to characterize platform failures. The characterization is performed by estimating (i) common failure types of the platform, (ii) key factors impacting platform failures, (iii) failure rate, and (iv) how user workload (files submitted for processing) impacts on the failure rate. The major findings are: (i) 34.1% of failures are caused by unexpected values in customers&#039; data, (ii) nearly 33% of the failures are because of timeout, and (iii) the failure rate increases if the workload intensity (transactions/second) increases, while there is no statistical evidence of being influenced by the workload volume (size of users&#039; data). Finally, the paper presents the lessons learned and how the findings and the implemented analysis tool allow platform developers to improve platform code, system settings and customer management.",

Furthermore, application reliability is related to the usage profiles of these applications; generally, the more an application is used, the more likely it is to have negative impact on reliability of others.

            "Abstract": "Use-cases perform an important role in capturing and analys-ing software requirements in the IT industry. A number of guidelines have been proposed in the literature on how to write use-cases. Structural defects can occur when use-cases are written without following such guidelines. We develop a taxonomy of structural defects and analyse a sample of 360 industrial use-cases to understand the nature of defects in them. Our sample comes from both client-based projects and in-house projects. The results show that, compared to a sample of theoretical use-cases that follow Cockburn&#039;s guidelines, industrial use-cases on the average exhibit defects such as complex structures, lack of customer focus and missing actors. Given the shortage of analysis of real industry samples, our results make a significant contribution towards the understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in industrial use-cases in terms of structural defects. The results will be useful for industry practitioners in adopting use-case modelling standards to reduce the defects as well as for software engineering researchers to explore the reasons for such differences between the theory and the practice in use-case modelling.",

To achieve so, developers need to make informed decisions on where to log and what to log in their logging practices during development. However, there exists no work on studying such logging practices in industry or helping developers make informed decisions. To fill this significant gap, in this paper, we systematically study the logging practices of developers in industry, with focus on where developers log. We obtain six valuable findings by conducting source code analysis on two large industrial systems (2.5M and 10.4M LOC, respectively) at Microsoft. We further validate these findings via a questionnaire survey with 54 experienced developers in Microsoft. In addition, our study demonstrates the high accuracy of up to 90% F-Score in predicting where to log.",

Although discovery of active files relies only on version history and defect classification, the simple concept of active files can deliver key insights into software development activities. Active files can help focus code reviews, implement targeted testing, show areas for potential merge conflicts and identify areas that are central for program comprehension.  In an empirical study of six large software systems within Microsoft ranging from products to services, we found that active files constitute only between 2-8% of the total system size, contribute 20-40% of system file changes, and are responsible for 60-90% of all defects. Not only this, but we establish that the majority, 65-95%, of the active files are architectural hub files which change due to feature addition as opposed to fixing defects.",

Our extensive study of production MapReduce programs reveals interesting findings on commutativity, nondeterminism, and correctness. Although non-commutative reduce functions lead to five bugs in our sample of well-tested production programs, we surprisingly have found that many non-commutative reduce functions are mostly harmless due to, for example, implicit data properties. These findings are instrumental in advancing our understanding of MapReduce program correctness.",

Nevertheless, applying this standard in practice is difficult due to unclear requirements and unclear or missing acceptance criteria. We systematically developed a quality model including proper measurement support that covers the code-related parts of IEC 61508 in [20]. In this paper, we present the assessment approach for automatic compliance checks of the code-related parts of the standard. We find in a validation study that the assessment results obtained by applying this approach to real-world projects are in line with their externally granted certification. The results are valid for the vast majority of the modeled elements of the standard. Moreover, by drilling down into the assessment results, we are able to detect deficiencies in the certified real-world projects.",

            "Abstract": "An increasing number of software systems today are very-large-scale software systems (VLSS) with system-of-systems (SoS) architectures. Due to their heterogeneity and complexity VLSS are difficult to understand and analyze, which results in various challenges for development and evolution. Existing software engineering processes, methods, and tools do not sufficiently address the characteristics of VLSS. Also, there are only a few empirical studies on software engineering for VLSS. We report on results of an exploratory case study involving engineers and technical project managers of an industrial automation VLSS for metallurgical plants. The paper provides empirical evidence on how VLSS are tested, commissioned, and operated in practice. The paper discusses practical challenges and reports industrial requirements regarding process and tool support. In particular, software processes and tools need to provide general guidance at the VLSS level as well as specific methods and tools for systems that are part of the VLSS. Processes and tools need to support multi-disciplinary engineering across system boundaries. Furthermore, managing variability and evolution is success-critical in VLSS verification and validation.",

The system under test (SUT), of which two different versions were tested by each of the two testers, is a professionally developed web-based data collection system that now is in use.  The two testers tested the same versions, had identical testing goals (to detect defects), had access to the same resources, but used different processes (i.e. manual without any automation vs. model-based with automatic test case generation and automatic test case execution). The testers did not interact with each other.  We compare the effectiveness (issues found) and efficiency (effort spent) of the two approaches. The results show, for example, that manual testing required less preparation time and that its test coverage was somewhat uneven. In contrast, MBT required more preparation time, was more systematic, and detected more issues. While the manual approach detected more inconsistencies between specified and actual text labels, MBT detected more functional issues. This is reflected in the severity score summary which was about 60% higher for MBT than Manual.",

            "Abstract": "Build systems specify how sources are transformed into deliverables, and hence must be carefully maintained to ensure that deliverables are assembled correctly. Similar to source code, build systems tend to grow in complexity unless specifications are refactored. This paper describes how clone detection can aid in quality assessments that determine if and where build refactoring effort should be applied. We gauge cloning rates in build systems by collecting and analyzing a benchmark comprising 3,872 build systems. Analysis of the benchmark reveals that: (1) build systems tend to have higher cloning rates than other software artifacts, (2) recent build technologies tend to be more prone to cloning, especially of configuration details like API dependencies, than older technologies, and (3) build systems that have fewer clones achieve higher levels of reuse via mechanisms not offered by build technologies. Our findings aided in refactoring a large industrial build system containing 1.1 million lines.",

One cause for the existence of such dependencies is the improper organization of elements into components.  Optimal reorganization of the components that resolves the cyclic dependencies in large and complex software systems is extremely difficult to perform manually and is not computationally feasible to perform automatically.  We present an approach for automatic untangling of cyclic dependencies among components for cycles of any size, having direct or transitive dependencies on one another. Our approach aims at minimizing the modifications to the original structure of the system, while taking into account various architectural properties.  We evaluate our solution on twelve open source and three industrial applications. We demonstrate its applicability and value through architectural metrics and feedback from system architects.",

Requirements engineers and non-technical stakeholders who are the system domain experts can greatly benefit from jointly using model checking during the elicitation, analysis, and verification of system requirements. However, model checking is formal verification and many requirements engineers and domain experts typically lack the knowledge and training needed to apply model checking to the formal verification of requirements. To get full advantages of model checking and domain experts’ knowledge in verifying the system, we proposed a front end framework to model checking and evaluated our approach using a real world application.",

            "Abstract": "Model checking is a powerful formal analytical approach to verifying software and hardware systems. However, general industrial adoption is far from widespread. Some difficulties include the inaccessibility of techniques and tools and the need for further empirical evaluation in industrial contexts. This study considers the use of Simulink Design Verifier, a model checker that forms part of a modelling system already widely used in the safety-critical industry. Model checking is applied to a number of real-world problem reports, associated with aero-engine monitoring functions, to determine whether it can provide a practical route into effective verification, particularly for non-specialists. The study also considers the extent to which model checking can satisfy the requirements of the extensive DO-178C guidance on formal methods. The study shows that the benefits of model checking can be realised in an industrial setting without specialist skills, particularly when it is targeted at parts of the software that are error-prone, difficult to verify conventionally or critical. Importantly, it shows that model checking can find errors earlier in the design cycle than testing, which potentially saves money, due to reduced scrap and rework.",

            "Abstract": "To minimize testing and technology upgrade costs for safety-critical systems, a thorough understanding and analysis of architectural dependencies is essential. Unmanaged dependencies create cost overruns and degraded qualities in systems. Architecture dependency analysis in practice, however, is typically performed in retrospect using code structures, the runtime image of a system, or both. Retrospective analysis can miss important dependencies that surface earlier in the life cycle. Development artifacts such as the software architecture description and the software requirements specification can augment the analysis process; however, the quality, consistency, and content of these artifacts vary widely. In this paper, we apply a commonly used dependency analysis metric, stability, and a visualization technique, the dependency structure matrix, to an architecture common to safety-critical systems that was re-engineered to reduce safety testing and upgrade cost. We describe the gaps observed when running the analysis and discuss the need for early life-cycle dependency analysis for managing rework costs in industrial software development environments.",

In this paper we analyze a large dataset, containing 352 finalized software engineering projects, with the goal to discover what factors affect software project performance, and what actions can be taken to increase project performance when building a software project portfolio. The software projects were classified in four quadrants of a Cost/Duration matrix: analysis was performed on factors that were strongly related to two of those quadrants, Good Practices and Bad Practices. A ranking was performed on the factors based on statistical significance. The paper results in an inventory of ‘what factors should be embraced when building a project portfolio?’ (Success Factors), and ‘what factors should be avoided when doing so?’ (Failure Factors). The major contribution of this paper is that it analyzes characteristics of best performers and worst performers in the dataset of software projects, resulting in 7 Success Factors (a.o. steady heartbeat, a fixed, experienced team, agile (Scrum), and release-based), and 9 Failure Factors (a.o. once-only project, dependencies with other systems, technology driven, and rules- and regulations driven).",

The latter offers the freedom of concurrent editing (which may be helpful or damaging) and has even more awareness deficits than screen sharing.  Objective: Characterize how competent distributed pair programmers may handle this additional freedom and these additional awareness deficits and characterize the impacts on the pair programming process.  Method: A revelatory case study, based on direct observation of a single, highly competent distributed pair of industrial software developers during a 3-day collaboration. We use recordings of these sessions and conceptualize the phenomena seen.  Results: 1.Skilled pairs may bridge the awareness deficits without visible obstruction of the overall process. 2.Skilled pairs may use the additional editing freedom in a useful limited fashion, resulting in potentially better fluency of the process than local pair programming.  Conclusion: When applied skillfully in an appropriate context, distributed-pair programming can (not will!) work at least as well as local pair programming.",

As such, the company offers a unique setting to study its impact on developers&#039; work. In this paper, we discuss how developers perceive the impact of pair programming and test automation on software quality, delivered feature scope, and various team work aspects. We draw our findings from a company-wide survey with answers from 174 developers working in 74 teams and 15 product owners from five locations world-wide. We complement our findings with insights from two in-depths case studies with two development teams. As expected, our findings confirm that the studied practices help developers develop better software. Deviating from existing preconceptions, however, the responding developers do not report a significant drop in their development speed. In addition, high adopters are more proud of their own contributions to the team, report a better team learning, and feel more motivated.",

            "Abstract": "Many professions evolve from their origins as a creative craft process to a more product-centered industrial process. Software development is on such an evolutionary trajectory. A major step in this evolution is the progression from ad hoc to more rigorous evidence-based decision-making in software development project management. This paper extends theory and practice in relation to lean software development using such an evidence-based approach. Based on a comprehensive dataset of software development metrics, gathered in a longitudinal case study over a 22-month period, the Erlang-C model is used to analyze different software development parameters and to guide management decision-making in relation to development resources. The analysis reveals how `gut-feel&#039; and intuition can be replaced by evidence-based decision-making, and reveals how incorrect assumptions can underpin decisions which as a consequence do not achieve the desired outcome.",

            "Abstract": "Many industrial systems are highly-configurable, complicating the testing and debugging process. While researchers have developed techniques to statically extract, quantify and manipulate the valid system configurations, we conjecture that many of these techniques will fail in practice. In this paper we analyze a highly-configurable industrial application and two open source applications in order to quantify the true challenges that configurability creates for software testing and debugging. We find that (1) all three applications consist of multiple programming languages, hence static analyses need to cross programming language barriers to work, (2) there are many access points and methods to modify configurations, implying that practitioners need configuration traceability and should gather and merge metadata from more than one source and (3) the configuration state of an application on failure cannot be reliably determined by reading persistent data; a runtime memory dump or other heuristics must be used for accurate debugging. We conclude with a roadmap and lessons learned to help practitioners better handle configurability now, and that may lead to new configuration-aware testing and debugging techniques in the future.",

A simulation scenario consists of a set of software components, configured in a certain way. A simulation fails when it does not behave as intended. This is typically a sign of a configuration problem. To detect configuration errors, we propose FELODE (Feature Location for Debugging), an approach that uses a single trace combined with user queries. When applied to CAE systems, FELODE achieves in average a precision of 50% and a recall of up to 100%.",

The history of and rationale for requirements evolution provides engineers some information about artifact dependencies for impact analysis. In this paper, we discuss a case study of requirements evolution for a large-scale system governed by Japanese laws and regulations. We track requirements evolution using issue tickets created in response to stakeholder requests. We provide rules to identify requirements evolution events (e.g. refine, decompose, and replace) from combinations of operations (e.g. add, change, and delete) specified in the issue tickets. We propose a Requirements Evolution Chart (REC) to visually represent requirements evolution as a series of events over time, and implement tool support to generate a REC from a series of issue tickets using our rules to identify requirements evolution events. We found that the REC supports impact analysis and compliance efforts.",

            "Abstract": "The spectacular failure of the Affordable Care Act website (&quot;Obamacare&quot;) has focused public attention on software engineering. Yet experienced practitioners mostly sighed and shrugged, because the historical record shows that only 10 % of large (&gt; 10 M) software projects using conventional methodologies such as Waterfall are successful. In contrast, Amazon and others successfully build comparably large and complex sites with hundreds of integrated subsystems by using modern agile methods and service-oriented architecture.  This contrast is one reason Industry has complained that academia ignores vital software topics, leaving students unprepared upon graduation. In too many courses, well-meaning instructors teach traditional approaches to software development that are neither supported by tools that students can readily use, nor appropriate for projects whose scope matches a college course. Students respond by continuing to build software more or less the way they always have, which is boring for students, frustrating for instructors, and disappointing for industry.  This talk explains how the confluence of cloud computing, software as a service (SaaS), and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have not only revolutionized the future of software, but changed it in a way that makes it easier and more rewarding to teach. UC Berkeley&#039;s revised Software Engineering course allows students to both enhance a legacy application and to develop a new app that matches requirements of non-technical customers, using the same tools and techniques that professionals use. By experiencing the whole software lifecycle repeatedly within a single college course, students learn to use and appreciate the skills that industry has long encouraged. The course is now popular with students, rewarding for faculty, and praised by industry.",

Crowdsourcing testing and educational projects are natural complementary. One of the challenges of crowdsourcing testing is to find a number of qualified workers with low cost. Students in software engineering are suitable candidates for crowdsourcing testing. On the other hand, practical projects play a key role in software engineering education. In order to enhance educational project outcomes and achieve industrial-strength training, we need to provide the opportunity for students to be exposed to commercial software development.  In this paper, we report a preliminary study on crowdsourcing testing for educational projects. We introduce three commercial software products as educational testing projects, which are crowdsourced by our teaching support system. We call this &quot;Quasi-Crowdsourcing Test&quot; (QCT) because the candidate workers are students, who have certain social relations. The investigation results are encouraging and show to be beneficial to both the students and industry in QCT projects.",

            "Abstract": "Reuse-Driven Software Engineering (RDSE) represents a development paradigm that promises to shorten development cycles and cut the costs associated with custom development by assembling systems from pre-existing software components and services. However, like most approaches that hold the promise of improving software engineering, the success of RDSE is dependent on skilled staff. This means that software engineering education remains the most effective vehicle to the community for reuse-driven technology transfer available. However, the teaching of RDSE poses many challenges to software engineering educators.

            "Abstract": "Program comprehension is one of the most important challenges that new software developers face. Educators have sought to prepare students for this challenge through hands-on software development projects. These projects teach students effective software engineering principles. But, students often struggle to see the value of these principles in class projects, and therefore struggle to recognize them outside the classroom. The inevitable result is that these students have difficulty comprehending large programs after graduation. In this paper, we argue that a remedy to this problem is to teach the history of how software development principles were created. In this collaborative work with the Notre Dame Department of History, we present a course that blends a discussion of this history with a hands-on software project. We present a summary of the history covered in our course, and reflect on our teaching experience.",

            "Abstract": "Graduating computer science and software engineering students do not always possess the necessary skills, abilities, or knowledge when beginning their careers in the software industry. The lack of these skills and abilities can limit the productivity of newly hired, recent graduates, or even prevent them from gaining employment. This paper presents the results of an empirical study where twenty-three managers and hiring personnel from various software companies in the United States and Europe were interviewed. Participants were asked about areas where recent graduates frequently struggled when beginning employment at their companies and which skill deficiencies might prevent a recent graduate from being hired. The results of this study indicate that recent graduates struggle with using configuration management systems (and other software tools), effectively communicating with co-workers and customers, producing unit tests for their code, and other skills or abilities. The results also indicate that a lack of project experience and problem solving abilities are the most commonly cited issues preventing students from gaining employment. This research is intended to assist educators in identifying areas where students may not measure up the expectations of industry companies and in improving the curriculum at their universities to better prepare them for their future careers.",

We write about the reasons behind ABB’s Software Development Improvement Program (SDIP), the requirements we established upfront, the people, processes and technologies we used, the promotion of SDIP, and metrics for measuring success. Finally, we share and describe results and lessons learned that could be applied to many organizations with similar issues. The goal of this paper is to provide a set of replicable best practices for initiating a software training program in a multi-national organization. The first SDIP online course was offered in June 2012. Since then, we have had more than 10,000 enrollments from employees in 54 countries. Today, our training library contains 89 e-learning, 17 webinar, video and virtual lab courses, and we have delivered more than 180 hosted webinars. Following each class, we ask students to evaluate the class. Ninety-eight percent are satisfied with the classes.",

The findings indicate that when working in a scenario-based language, programmers think on a higher level of abstraction than when working with OOP languages. This is explained by other findings, which suggest how the declarative, incremental nature of scenario-based programming facilitates separation of con- cerns, and how it supports a kind of programming that al- lows programmers to work with a less detailed mental model of the system they develop. The findings shed light on how declarative approaches can reduce the cognitive load involved in programming, and how scenario-based program- ming might solve some of the difficulties involved in the use of declarative languages. This is applicable to the design of learning materials, and to the design of programming lan- guages and tools.",

            "Abstract": "At Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley, the graduate master program ends with a practicum project during which students serve as software engineering consultants for an industry client. In this context, students are challenged to demonstrate their ability to work on self-managing and self-organizing teams. This paper presents a field study of the Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) Essence framework. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Essence’s novel state-based monitoring and goal-driven steering approach provided by the Essence kernel alphas and their states. The researchers conducted the study on seven graduate master student teams applying the approach throughout their practicum projects. The research methodology involves weekly observation and recording of each team’s state progression and collecting students’ reflection on the application of the approach. The main result validates that the approach provides student teams with a holistic, lightweight, non-prescriptive and method-agnostic way to monitor progress and steer projects, as well as an effective structure for team reflection and risk management. The paper also validates that the Essence kernel provides an effective mechanism for monitoring and steering work common to most student software projects. This includes the work done during project initiation as well as the work done at the project or release level. Support for technical work should come from additional practices added on top of the kernel, or by extending or altering the kernel definition. The conclusion is that the approach enables students to learn to steer projects effectively by addressing the various dimensions of software engineering. Hence the approach could be leveraged in software engineering education.",

            "Abstract": "Continuous delivery is a set of practices and principles to release software faster and more frequently. While it helps to bridge the gap between developers and operations for software in production, it can also improve the communication between developers and customers in the development phase, i.e. before software is in production. It shortens the feedback cycle and developers ideally use it right from the beginning of a software development project. In this paper we describe the implementation of a customized continuous delivery workflow and its benefits in a multi-customer project course in summer 2013. Our workflow focuses on the ability to deliver software with only a few clicks to the customer in order to obtain feedback as early as possible. This helps developers to validate their understanding about requirements, which is especially helpful in agile projects where requirements might change often. We describe how we integrated this workflow and the role of the release manager into our project-based organization and how we introduced it using different teaching methods. Within three months 90 students worked in 10 different projects with real customers from industry and delivered 490 releases. After the project course we evaluated our approach in an online questionnaire and in personal interviews. Our findings and observations show that participating students understood and applied the concepts and are convinced about the benefits of continuous delivery.",

Software Engineering is a practice-oriented and applied discipline and hence there is an emphasis on hands-on development, process, usage of tools in addition to theory and basic concepts. We present an approach for mining the process data (process mining) from software repositories archiving data generated as a result of constructing software by student teams in an educational setting. We present an application of mining three software repositories: team wiki (used during requirement engineering), version control system (development and maintenance) and issue tracking system (corrective and adaptive maintenance) in the context of an undergraduate Software Engineering course. We propose visualizations, metrics and algorithms to provide an insight into practices and procedures followed during various phases of a software development life-cycle. The proposed visualizations and metrics (learning analytics) provide a multi-faceted view to the instructor serving as a feedback tool on development process and quality by students. We mine the event logs produced by software repositories and derive insights such as degree of individual contributions in a team, quality of commit messages, intensity and consistency of commit activities, bug fixing process trend and quality, component and developer entropy, process compliance and verification. We present our empirical analysis on a software repository dataset consisting of 19 teams of 5 members each and discuss challenges, limitations and recommendations.",

            "Abstract": "Many educators now include software testing activities in programming assignments, so there is a growing demand for appropriate methods of assessing the quality of student-written software tests. While tests can be hand-graded, some educators also use objective performance metrics to assess software tests. The most common measures used at present are code coverage measures—tracking how much of the student’s code (in terms of statements, branches, or some combination) is exercised by the corresponding software tests. Code coverage has limitations, however, and sometimes it overestimates the true quality of the tests. Some researchers have suggested that mutation analysis may provide a better indication of test quality, while some educators have experimented with simply running every student’s test suite against every other student’s program—an “all-pairs” strategy that gives a bit more insight into the quality of the tests. However, it is still unknown which one of these measures is more accurate, in terms of most closely predicting the true bug revealing capability of a given test suite. This paper directly compares all three methods of measuring test quality in terms of how well they predict the observed bug revealing capabilities of student-written tests when run against a naturally occurring collection of student-produced defects. Experimental results show that all-pairs testing—running each student’s tests against every other student’s solution—is the most effective predictor of the underlying bug revealing capability of a test suite. Further, no strong correlation was found between bug revealing capability and either code coverage or mutation analysis scores.",

            "Abstract": "Developing software by teams which adopted the agile development methodology such as Scrum seems totally natural in industry. On the other hand, students belonging to graduate schools of information science who have some experience on the agile team software development are rare. In the initial education on the Scrum, there exists some challenges. The first one is a concept of self-organization. In the Scrum project, members of the team determine how best to accomplish the tasks by themselves. However, it is challenging for students with less experience on team software development to cultivate the self-organizing team by themselves. The 2nd one is inequality on task assignment. In the Scrum project, each member pulls tasks to perform, and do not wait to be assigned by Project Manager. The assignment behavior may cause inequality on task assignment. As a result, such inequality may also cause inequality on learning opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge on the process and the product. In this paper, we propose quantitative assessment methods for the Scrum project with using TiDD(Ticket Driven Development) for the initial education on the Scrum framework and web application production. We report on our basic PBL(Project-Based Learning) course which involved 49 students. The use of quantitative criteria enabled students and teachers to assess the Scrum projects in the viewpoints of quality, assignment, and delivery of projects.",

The game was initially developed as an internal training tool in F-Secure Corporation, a Finnish security software company, to support their agile adoption. In the game, student teams learn the Scrum roles, events and concepts in practice by simulating several development Sprints, while incrementally planning and building a product of LEGO blocks. Student satisfaction was measured by a survey at the end of the course, and student learning evalu- ated by learning diaries. Our results show that the students were highly satisfied with the game, and that students with various degrees of experience with Scrum all learned a lot. In particular, students reported gaining insights about require- ments management and customer collaboration, effective teamwork, and the Scrum roles.",

This objective is accomplished by structuring the course around two parallel learning progressions rather than around the logical structure of a compiler.  The nominal purpose of the project is to develop a simulator and synthesizer for simple circuits written in a subset of VHDL. This subset of VHDL is translated to a simple LL(1) boolean formula language. The circuit simulator reads and writes binary waveforms according to a regular grammar. The students start working with the simple waveform language and work their way up to the subset of VHDL. As the complexity of the input language and transformations increases, new software engineering concepts are introduced to help manage that complexity.  At the end of the project the students can simulate and synthesize simple circuits such as a ripple-carry adder or a multiplexer.",

Today, a scientist demonstrates the validity of a model by making an argument in a paper and submitting it for peer review, a process comparable to code review in software engineering. While human review helps to ensure that contributions meet high-level goals, software engineers typically supplement it with unit testing to get a more complete picture of the status of a project.  We argue that a similar test-driven methodology would be valuable to scientific communities as they seek to validate increasingly complex models against growing repositories of empirical data. Scientific communities differ from software communities in several key ways, however. In this paper, we introduce SciUnit, a framework for test-driven scientific model validation, and outline how, supported by new and existing collaborative infrastructure, it could integrate into the modern scientific process.",

            "Abstract": "Cloning is widely used for creating new product variants. While it has low adoption costs, it often leads to maintenance problems. Long term reliance on cloning is discouraged in favor of systematic reuse offered by product line engineering (PLE) with a central platform integrating all reusable assets. Unfortunately, adopting an integrated platform requires a risky and costly migration. However, industrial experience shows that some benefits of an integrated platform can be achieved by properly managing a set of cloned variants.  In this paper, we propose an incremental and minimally invasive PLE adoption strategy called virtual platform. Virtual platform covers a spectrum of strategies between ad-hoc clone and own and PLE with a fully-integrated platform divided into six governance levels. Transitioning to a governance level requires some effort and it provides some incremental benefits. We discuss tradeoffs among the levels and illustrate the strategy on an example implementation.",

            "Abstract": "Traditional integrated development environments (IDEs) provide developers with robust environments for writing, testing, debugging, and deploying code. As the world becomes increasingly networked and more services are delivered via the cloud, it is only natural that the functionality of IDEs be delivered via the cloud. In addition to simplifying the provisioning and deployment of new IDE features, and making it easier to integrate with other web native tools, cloud based IDEs provide some fundamental advantages when it comes to understanding the behavior of a wide community of software developers. One of these advantages for the IDE provider is the ability to transparently monitor and analyze the real-time fine-grained actions of a large number of developers. In this paper, we explore how to leverage these transparent monitoring capabilities of cloud based IDEs to develop advanced analytics to understand developers&#039; behavior and infer their characteristics. We demonstrate the feasibility of this research direction with a preliminary study focusing on the way that source code files grow for different developers, development tasks, and skill levels. We then analyze the trends of source code file growth and find growth is more similar within subjects than within tasks.",

As previous research and a small exploratory study that we conducted show, developers perform poorly in identifying good search terms and therefore waste a lot of time querying and exploring irrelevant code. To support developers in this step, we present an approach to automatically identify good search terms. Based on existing work and an analysis of change tasks, we derived heuristics, determined their relevancy and used the results to develop our approach. For a preliminary evaluation, we conducted a study with ten developers working on open source change tasks. Our approach was able to identify good search terms for all tasks and outperformed the searches of the participants, illustrating the potential of our approach. In addition, since the used heuristics are solely based on textual features of change tasks, our approach is easy and generally applicable and can leverage much of the existing work on feature location.",

            "Abstract": "Static analysis (SA) tools are often used to analyze a software system to identify violation of good programming practices (such as not validating arguments to public methods, use of magic numbers etc.) and potential defects (such as misused APIs, race conditions, deadlocks etc.). Most widely used SA tools perform shallow data flow analysis with the results containing considerable number of False Positives (FPs) and False Negatives (FNs). Moreover it is difficult to run these tools only on newly added or modified piece of code. In order to determine which violations are new we need to perform tedious process of post processing the SA tool results. The proposed system takes into consideration the above mentioned issues of SA and provides a lightweight approach to detection of coding violations statically and proactively, with high degree of confidence using a learning system.

            "Abstract": "Project schedules are essential for successfully carrying out software projects. To support manager’s decision making, many project scheduling algorithms have been developed in recent years for generating candidate project schedules. However, these project schedules may not be able to be used directly because the uncertainty and complexity of real-world software development environments which have been overlooked or simplified in the project scheduling algorithms. Therefore, significant human efforts are still required to evaluate and compare these project schedules. To address such a problem, we propose a quantitative analysis approach based on statistical model checking technique which serves as a novel evaluation method for project schedules. By using the UPPAAL-SMC, we can systematically evaluate the performance of a project schedule and answer complex questions which are vital for manager’s decision making but cannot be efficiently addressed by any existing tools. The preliminary results show that our approach can efficiently filter out unsatisfactory candidates by answering simple “yes or no” questions first and then help effectively compare the rest by answering complicated user specified questions. Therefore, the human efforts in planning project schedules can be significantly reduced.",

These dependencies are no- toriously large and complex, and many can only be known at runtime. In this paper, we propose execution record/replay as a solution to this problem. We describe a novel reuse technique that allows programmers to reuse functions from a C or C++ program, by recording the execution of the program and selectively modifying how its functions are re- played. We have implemented our technique and evaluated it in a preliminary study in which two programmers used our tool to complete four tasks over four hours.",

When faced with such conceptual inconsistencies, debugging can be very difficult. Inferring and presenting developers with accurate behavioral models of the system implementation can help developers reconcile their view of the system with reality and improve system quality.  We present Perfume, a model-inference algorithm that improves on the state of the art by using performance information to differentiate otherwise similar-appearing executions and to remove false positives from the inferred models. Perfume uses a system&#039;s runtime execution logs to infer a concise, precise, and predictive finite state machine model that describes both observed executions and executions that have not been observed but that the system can likely generate. Perfume guides the model inference process by mining temporal performance-constrained properties from the logs, ensuring precision of the model&#039;s predictions. We describe the model inference process and demonstrate how it improves precision over the state of the art.",

Bidirectional model transformation approaches provide techniques for developers to specify the bidirectional relationship between source and target models, while keeping related models synchronized for free. Since models of interest are usually not in a one-to-one correspondence, this synchronization process is inherently ambiguous. Nevertheless, existing bidirectional model trans- formation tools focus mainly on enforcing consistency and provide developers only limited control over how models are synchronized, solving the latent ambiguity via default strategies whose behavior is unclear to developers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which developers write update programs that succinctly describe how a target model can be used to update a source model, such that the bidirectional behavior is fully determined. The new approach mitigates the unpredictability of existing solutions, by enabling a finer and more transparent control of what a bidirectional transformation does, and suggests a research direction for building more robust bidirectional model transformation tools.",

Incorporating fault tolerance strategies enables such system to complete its function despite the failure of some of its parts. Prior to the execution of some fault tolerance strategies, failure detection is needed. Detecting incorrect output, for instance, assumes the existence of an oracle to check the correctness of program outputs given an input. However, in many practical situations, oracle does not exist or is extremely difficult to apply. Such an oracle problem is a major challenge in the context of software testing. In this paper, we propose to apply metamorphic testing, a software testing method that alleviates the oracle problem, into fault tolerance. The proposed technique supports failure detection without the need of oracles.",

Relatively less effort has been put into understanding the hows and whys of such approaches. For example, a critical assumption of the GenProg technique is that certain bugs can be fixed by copying and re-arranging existing code. In other words, GenProg assumes that the fix ingredients already exist elsewhere in the code. In this paper, we formalize these assumptions around the concept of ``temporal redundancy&#039;&#039;. A temporally redundant commit is only composed of what has already existed in previous commits. Our experiments show that a large proportion of commits that add existing code are temporally redundant. This validates the fundamental redundancy assumption of GenProg.",

            "Abstract": "The oracle—an arbiter of correctness of the system under test (SUT)—is a major component of the testing process. Specifying oracles is particularly challenging for real-time embedded systems, where small changes in time or sensor inputs may cause large differences in behavior. Behavioral models of such systems, often built for analysis and simulation purposes, are naturally appealing for reuse as oracles. However, these models typically provide an idealized view of the system. Even when given the same inputs, the model’s behavior can frequently be at variance with some acceptable behavior of the SUT executing on a real platform. We therefore propose steering the model when used as an oracle, to admit an expanded set of behaviors when judging the SUT’s adherence to its requirements. On detecting a behavioral difference, the model is backtracked and then searched for a new state that satisfies certain constraints and minimizes a dissimilarity metric. The goal is to allow non-deterministic, but bounded, behavior differences while preventing future mismatches, by guiding the oracle—within limits—to match the execution of the SUT. Early experimental results show that steering significantly increases SUT-oracle conformance with minimal masking of real faults and, thus, has significant potential for reducing development costs.",

            "Abstract": "Software bug localization is the problem of determining buggy statements in a software system. It is a crucial and expensive step in the software debugging process. Interest in it has grown rapidly in recent years, and many approaches have been proposed. However, existing approaches tend to use isolated information to address the problem, and are often ad hoc. In particular, most existing approaches predict the likelihood of a statement being buggy sequentially and separately.  This paper proposes a well-founded, integrated solution to the software bug localization problem based on Markov logic. Markov logic combines first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models by attaching weights to first-order formulas, and views them as templates for features of Markov networks. We show how a number of salient program features can be seamlessly combined in Markov logic, and how the resulting joint inference can be solved.  We implemented our approach in a debugging system, called MLNDebugger, and evaluated it on 4 small programs. Our initial results demonstrated that our approach achieved higher accuracy than a previous approach.",

            "Abstract": "Bug reports seldom contain information about the steps to reproduce a failure. Therefore, failure reproduction is a time consuming, difficult, and sometimes impossible task for software developers. Users are either unaware of the importance of steps to reproduce, are unable to describe them, or do not have time to report them. Similarly, automated crash reporting tools usually do not capture this information. In order to tackle this problem, we propose to exploit the action history of undo features, i.e. the history of user actions captured by many applications in order to allow users to undo previous actions. As it is captured anyway, our approach does not introduce additional monitoring overhead. We propose to extract the action history upon occurrence of a failure and present it to developers during bug fixing. Our hypothesis is that information about user actions contained in the action history of undo features enables developers to reproduce failures. We support this hypothesis with anecdotal evidence from a small empirical study of bug reports. A thorough evaluation is necessary to investigate the applicability and impact of our approach and to compare it to existing capture/ replay approaches.",

In software analysis and maintenance, bug tracking system receive feedbacks of the software project users everyday, which means that the data is increasing everyday. A large-scale bug tracking system that contains large amount of information does not give end users an easy way to analyze bug information because it lacks of good interaction system. We present Bugarium that integrate 3D Motion Controller and data-driven documents to ease both interaction and visualization on a large-scale bug repository. Bugarium leads to a significant increase in terms of using 3D motion controller to operate big data in software visualization. An user study shows that Bugarium made users satisfied while using it to interact and visualize a large-scale bug tracking system.",

Encoding complex string parsing in a very compact notation, their complexity and compactness, however, introduce particular challenges with respect to program comprehension. In this paper, we present RegViz, an approach to visually augment regular expressions without changing their original textual notation. The visual encoding clarifies the structure of the regular expressions and clearly discerns included tokens by function. The approach also provides advanced visual highlighting of matches in a sample text and defining test cases therein. We implemented RegViz as a Web-based tool for JavaScript regular expressions. Expert feedback suggests that the approach is intuitive to apply and increases the readability of regular expressions.",

            "Abstract": "Bug classification is a well-established practice which supports important activities such as enhancing verification and validation (V&amp;V) efficiency and effectiveness. The state of the practice is manual and hence classification errors occur. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the value of bug classification (specifically, failure type classification) to its error rate; i.e., the degree to which misclassified historic bugs decrease the V&amp;V effectiveness (i.e., the ability to find bugs of a failure type of interest). Results from the analysis of an industrial database of more than 3,000 bugs show that the impact of classification error rate on V&amp;V effectiveness significantly varies with failure type. Specifically, there are failure types for which a 5% classification error can decrease the ability to find them by 66%. Conversely, there are failure types for which the V&amp;V effectiveness is robust to very high error rates. These results show the utility of future research aimed at: 1) providing better tool support for decreasing human errors in classifying the failure type of bugs, 2) providing more robust approaches for the selection of V&amp;V techniques, and 3) including robustness as an important criterion when evaluating technologies.",

            "Abstract": "The rapid advances in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are expected to enrich the quality of people’s lives. BCI connects computer actions with neural inputs—signals indicating the user’s intentions, desired actions, attention, thoughts, memories, and emotions. BCI applications present significant challenges for computer science and software engineering research: an avalanche of neural signals will make their way as direct input into software systems. Given the differences between neural inputs and behavioral ones, the integration of neural inputs will require special approaches, and not simply adding yet more user interface channels to pre-existing software systems. This paper explores the challenges of designing and implementing self-adaptive software systems that could synergize brain states. After framing the problem, its rationale and possible solutions, in this paper we argue that the software engineering community ought to investigate how to incorporate neural inputs into software systems. The days are now upon us when software systems can “feel” and “anticipate” the users’ intentions and therefore react self-adaptively and synergistically to their needs.",

We performed a controlled experiment with 10 subjects; 8 of them showed high cerebral blood flow while understanding strongly obfuscated programs (requiring high mental workload).

However, just few significant results have been published so far. In this paper, we propose a novel and formal Bayesian definition of surprise as the basis for quantitative analysis to measure degrees of uncertainty and deviations of self-adaptive systems from normal behavior. A surprise measures how observed data affects the models or assumptions of the world during runtime. The key idea is that a &quot;surprising&#039;&#039; event can be defined as one that causes a large divergence between the belief distributions prior to and posterior to the event occurring. In such a case the system may decide either to adapt accordingly or to flag that an abnormal situation is happening. In this paper, we discuss possible applications of Bayesian theory of surprise for the case of self-adaptive systems using Bayesian dynamic decision networks.",

            "Abstract": "Traditional models have limitation to model adaptive software systems since they build only for fixed requirements, and cannot model the behaviors that change at run-time in response to environmental changes. In this paper, an adaptive Petri net is proposed to model a self-adaptive software system. It is an extension of hybrid Petri nets by embedding a neural network algorithm into them at some special transitions. The proposed net has the following advantages: 1) It can model a runtime environment; 2) The components in the model can collaborate to make adaption decisions; and 3) The computing is done at the local, while the adaption is for the whole system. We illustrate the proposed adaptive Petri net by modeling a manufacturing system.",

            "Abstract": "The rapid growth of social platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn underscores the need for people to connect to existing and new contacts for recreational and professional purposes. A parallel of this phenomenon exists in the software development arena as well. Open-source code sharing platforms such as GitHub provide the ability to follow people and projects of interest. However, users are manually required to identify projects or other users whom they might be interested in following. We observe that most software projects use third-party libraries and that developers who contribute to multiple projects often use the same library APIs across projects. Thus, the library APIs seem to be a good fingerprint of their skill set. Hence, we argue that library APIs can form the social glue to connect people and projects having similar interests. We propose APINet, a system that mines API usage profiles from source code version management systems and create a social network of people, projects and libraries. We describe our initial implementation that uses data from 568 open-source projects hosted on GitHub. Our system recommends to a user new projects and people that they may be interested in, suggests communities of people who use related libraries and finds experts for a given topic who are closest in a user&#039;s social graph.",

            "Abstract": "Software engineering for ‘social good’ is an area receiving growing interest in recent years. Software is increasingly seen as a way to promote positive social change: this includes initiatives such as Code for America and events such as hackathons, which strive to build innovative software solutions with a social conscience. From a software engineering perspective, existing software processes do not always match the needs of these social software projects, which are primarily aimed at social change and often involve vulnerable communities. In this paper, we argue for new software processes that combine elements of agile, iterative development with principles drawn from action research and participatory design. The former allow social software projects to be built quickly with limited resources; the latter allow for a proper understanding of the social context and vulnerable user groups. The paper describes Speedplay, a software development management framework integrating these approaches, and illustrates its use in a real social innovation case study.",

            "Abstract": "Source code identifiers such as classes, methods, and fields appear in many different contexts. For instance, a developer performing a task using the android.app.Activity class could consult various project resources including the class&#039;s source file, API documentation, issue tracker, mailing list discussions, code reviews, or questions on Stack Overflow.  These information sources are logically connected by the source code elements they describe, but are generally decoupled from each other. This has historically been tolerated by developers, since there was no obvious way to easily navigate between the data sources. However, it is now common for these sources to have web-based front ends that provide a standard mechanism (the browser) for viewing and interacting with the data they contain. Augmenting these front ends with hyperlinks and search would make development easier by allowing developers to quickly navigate between disparate sources of information about the same code element.  In this paper, we propose a method of automatically linking disparate information repositories with an emphasis on high precision. We also propose a method of augmenting web-based front ends with these links to make it easier for developers to quickly gain a comprehensive view of the source code elements they are investigating. Research challenges include identifying source code tokens in the midst of natural language text and incomplete code fragments, dynamically augmenting the web views of the data repositories, and supporting novel composition of the link data to provide comprehensive views for specific source code elements.",

In contrast, traditional change-impact analysis techniques analyze related versions of the program only after the code has been checked into the master repository. We propose a novel approach, DeCAF (Development Context Analysis Framework), that leverages the development context to scope a change impact analysis technique. The goal is to characterize the impact of each developer on other developers in the team. There are various client applications such as task prioritization, early conflict detection, and providing advice on testing that can benefit from such a characterization. The DeCAF frame- work leverages information from the development context to bound the iDiSE change impact analysis technique to analyze only the parts of the code base that are of interest. Bounding the analysis can enable DeCAF to efficiently com- pute the impact of changes using a combination of program dependence and symbolic execution based approaches.",

When these test suites become too large, they can eventually reach a point where they become too length to regularly execute. Previous work in Test Suite Minimization has reduced the number of tests in such suites by attempting to identify those that are redundant (e.g. by a coverage metric). Our approach to ameliorating the runtime of these large test suites is complementary, instead focusing on reducing the overhead of running each test, an approach that we call Unit Test Virtualization. This Tool Demonstration presents our implementation of Unit Test Virtualization, VMVM (pronounced &quot;vroom-vroom&quot;) and summarizes an evaluation of our implementation on 20 real-world Java applications, showing that it reduces test suite execution time by up to 97% (on average, 62%).

Atlas decouples the domain-specific analysis goal from its underlying mechanism by splitting analysis into two distinct phases. In the first phase, polynomial-time static analyzers index the software AST, building a rich graph database. In the second phase, users can explore the graph directly or run custom analysis scripts written using a convenient API. These features make Atlas ideal for both interaction and automation. In this paper, we describe the motivation, design, and use of Atlas. We present validation case studies, including the verification of safe synchronization of the Linux kernel, and the detection of malware in Android applications.

            "Abstract": "Bug localization refers to the process of identifying source code files that contain defects from descriptions of these defects which are typically contained in bug reports. There have been many bug localization techniques proposed in the literature. However, often it is hard to compare these techniques since different evaluation datasets are used. At times the datasets are not made publicly available and thus it is difficult to reproduce reported results. Furthermore, some techniques are only evaluated on small datasets and thus it is not clear whether the results are generalizable. Thus, there is a need for a platform that allows various techniques to be compared with one another on a common pool containing a large number of bug reports with known defective source code files. In this paper, we address this need by proposing our Bug lOcalization experimental plATform (BOAT). BOAT is an extensible web application that contains thousands of bug reports with known defective source code files. Researchers can create accounts in BOAT, upload executables of their bug localization techniques, and see how these techniques perform in comparison with techniques uploaded by other researchers, with respect to some standard evaluation measures. BOAT is already preloaded with several bug localization techniques and thus researchers can directly compare their newly proposed techniques against these existing techniques. BOAT has been made available online since October 2013, and researchers could access the platform at: http://www.vlis.zju.edu.cn/blp.",

            "Abstract": "Software systems are often constructed by combining new and existing services and components. Models of such systems should therefore be compositional in order to reflect the architectural structure. We present herein an extension of the LTSA model checker. It supports the specification, visualisation and failure analysis of composable, probabilistic behaviour of component-based systems, modelled as Probabilistic Component Automata (PCA). To evaluate aspects such as the probability of system failure, a DTMC model can be automatically constructed from the composition of the PCA representations of each component and analysed in tools such as PRISM. Before composition, we reduce each PCA to its interface behaviour in order to mitigate state explosion associated with composite representations. Moreover, existing behavioural analysis techniques in LTSA can be applied to PCA representations to verify the compatibility of interface behaviour between components with matching provided-required interfaces.

            "Abstract": "The complexity of web application construction is increasing at an astounding rate. Developing for the web typically crosses multiple application tiers in a variety of languages, which can result in disjoint code bases. This lack of standardization introduces new challenges for reasoning.  In this paper we introduce Verily, a new web framework for Java that supports the development of verifiable web applications. Rather than requiring that programs be verified in separate a posteriori analysis, Verily supports construction via a series of Recipes, which are properties of an application that are enforced at compile time. In addition to introducing the Verily framework, we also present two Recipes: the Core Recipe, an application architecture for web applications designed to replace traditional server-side Model View Controller, and the Global Mutable State Recipe, which enables developers to use sessions within their applications without resorting to the use of unrestricted global mutable state.

            "Abstract": "Measuring the similarity of words is important in accurately representing and comparing documents, and thus improves the results of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The NLP community has proposed various measurements based on WordNet, a lexical database that contains relationships between many pairs of words. Recently, a number of techniques have been proposed to address software engineering issues such as code search and fault localization that require understanding natural language documents, and a measure of word similarity could improve their results. However, WordNet only contains information about words senses in general-purpose conversation, which often differ from word senses in a software-engineering context, and the software-specific word similarity resources that have been developed rely on data sources containing only a limited range of words and word uses.  In recent work, we have proposed a word similarity resource based on information collected automatically from StackOverflow. We have found that the results of this resource are given scores on a 3-point Likert scale that are over 50% higher than the results of a resource based on WordNet. In this demo paper, we review our data collection methodology and propose a Java API to make the resulting word similarity resource useful in practice.  The SEWordSim database and related information can be found at http://goo.gl/BVEAs8. Demo video is available at http://goo.gl/dyNwyb.",

In particular, a customer  issue assigned to a wrong product team takes much longer to  resolve (negatively affecting user-perceived quality) and wastes  developer effort. In Open Source Software (OSS) and in commercial projects  values in issue-tracking systems (ITS) or Customer  Relationship Management (CRM) systems are often assigned by  non-developers for whom the assignment task is difficult.  We propose PAR (Product Assignment Recommender) to  estimate the odds that a value in the ITS is  incorrect. PAR learns from the past activities in ITS and performs  prediction using a logistic regression model. Our demonstrations show how  PAR helps developers to focus on fixing real problems, and how it can  be used to improve data accuracy in ITS by crowd-sourcing  non-developers to verify and correct low-accuracy data.  http://youtu.be/IuykbzSTj8s",

Typically, developers subscribe to issues they are interested in through the tracker, and are informed of changes and new developments via automated email.

To address this problem, we present a tool called called DASH that is implemented in the form of personalized views of issues; developers indicate issues of interest and DASH presents customized views of their progress and informs them of changes as they occur.

            "Abstract": "Existing code completion engines leverage only pre-defined templates or match a set of user-defined APIs to complete the rest of changes. We propose a new code completion technique, called Cookbook, where developers can define custom edit recipes—a reusable template of complex edit operations—by specifying change examples. It generates an abstract edit recipe that describes the most specific generalization of the demonstrated example program transformations. Given a library of edit recipes, it matches a developer’s edit stream to recommend a suitable recipe that is capable of filling out the rest of change customized to the target. We evaluate Cookbook using 68 systematic changed methods drawn from the version history of Eclipse SWT. Cookbook is able to narrow down to the most suitable recipe in 75% of the cases. It takes 120 milliseconds to find the correct suitable recipe on average, and the edits produced by the selected recipe are on average 82% similar to developer’s hand edit. This shows Cookbook’s potential to speed up manual editing and to minimize developer’s errors. Our demo video is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4BNc8FT4RU.",

We present two tools: ShiVector to transparently add vector timestamps to distributed system logs, and ShiViz to help developers understand distributed system logs by visualizing them as space-time diagrams. ShiVector is the first tool to offer automated vector timestamp instrumentation without modifying source code. The vector-timestamped logs capture partial ordering information, useful for analysis and comprehension. ShiViz space-time diagrams are simple to understand and interactive — the user can explore the log through the visualization to understand complex system behavior. We applied ShiVector and ShiViz to two systems and found that they aid developers in understanding and debugging.",

While several automated approaches exist to help developers in localizing faults in traditional source code and in detecting code smells in build code, fault localization techniques have not yet been developed for build code. In this work, we introduce MkFault, a tool to localize errors resulting in build crashes. MkFault monitors the execution traces from GNU Make statements that produce concrete build rules and the original code locations for each component of a rule (i.e., target, prerequisites, and recipe). It then uses a novel ranking algorithm to give suspiciousness scores to the original statements in the Makefile. In our empirical evaluation with real faults, we show that MkFault can help localize faults in Make code with high accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "The execution of a concurrent Java program can deadlock if its threads attempt to acquire shared locks in cyclic order. The JVM permits such behaviour. Research has demonstrated that such deadlocks can be predicted through static analysis. It is also known that a tool like Dimmunix helps to avoid deadlocks whose deadlock patterns (fingerprints) are known. The current work combines both approaches: conducting static analysis to predict possible deadlocks and provide their corresponding fingerprints to Dimmunix. These fingerprints forewarn Dimmunix of all deadlock possibilities rather than it learn about them one at a time. For our experiments we use 8 deadlock programs that were developed based upon deadlock predictions from static analysis of the entire JRE by a tool called Stalemate. We design a process to generate Dimmunix fingerprints from deadlock predictions.",

            "Abstract": "Designing software systems with uncertainties, such as incomplete knowledge about changing system goals, is challenging. One approach to handle uncertainties is self-adaptation, where a system consists of a managed system and a managing system that realizes a feedback loop. The promise of self-adaptation is to enable a system to adapt itself realizing the system goals, regarding uncertainties. To realize this promise it is critical to provide assurances for the self-adaptive behaviours. Several approaches have been proposed that exploit formal methods to provide these assurances. However, an integrated approach that combines: (1) seamless integration of offline and online verification (to deal with inherent limitations of verification), with (2) support for runtime evolution of the system (to deal with new or changing goals) is lacking. In this paper, we outline a new approach named Active FORmal Models of Self-adaptation (ActivFORMS) that aims to deal with these challenges. In ActivFORMS, the formal models of the managing system are directly deployed and executed to realize self-adaptation, guaranteeing the verified properties. Having the formal models readily available at runtime paves the way for: (1) incremental verification during system execution, and (2) runtime evolution of the self-adaptive system. Experiences with a robotic system show promising results.",

Although they can yield reasonably good prediction results, there still exists much room for improvement on the aspect of prediction accuracy. Sparse representation is one of the most advanced machine learning techniques. It performs well with respect to signal compression and classification, but suffers from its time-consuming sparse coding. Compared with sparse representation, collaborative representation classification (CRC) can yield significantly lower computational complexity and competitive classification performance in pattern recognition domains. To achieve better defect prediction results, we introduce the CRC technique in this paper and propose a CRC based software defect prediction (CSDP) approach. We first design a CRC based learner to build a prediction model, whose computational burden is low. Then, we design a CRC based predictor to classify whether the query software modules are defective or defective-free. Experimental results on the widely used NASA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

Intuitively, a software is redundant when it can perform the same functionality in different ways. Researches have successfully defined several techniques that exploit various form of redundancy, for example for tolerating failures at runtime and for testing purposes.  We aim to formalize and study the redundancy of software systems in general. In particular, we are interested in the intrinsic redundancy of software systems, that is a form of undocumented redundancy present in software systems as consequence of various design and implementation decisions. In this thesis we will formalize the intuitive notion of redundancy. On the basis of such formalization, we will investigate the pervasiveness and the fundamental characteristics of the intrinsic redundancy of software systems. We will study the nature, the origin, and various forms of such redundancy. We will also develop techniques to automatically identify the intrinsic redundancy of software systems.",

In software testing, the role of test oracles is crucial: The quality of test oracles directly affects the effectiveness of the testing activity and influences the final quality of software systems. So far, research in software testing focused mostly on automating the generation of test inputs and the execution of test suites, paying less attention to the generation of test oracles. Available techniques for generating test oracle are either effective but expensive or inexpensive but ineffective. Our research work focuses on the generation of cost-effective test oracles. Recent research work has shown that modern software systems can provide the same functionality through different execution sequences. In other words, multiple execution sequences perform the same, or almost the same, action. This phenomenon is called intrinsic redundancy of software systems. We aim to design and develop a completely automated technique to generate test oracles by exploiting the intrinsic redundancy freely available in the software. Test oracles generated by our technique check the equivalence between a given execution sequence and all the redundant and supposedly equivalent execution sequences that are available. The results obtained so far are promising.",

The applicability of data-flow testing is limited by the complexity and the imprecision of the approach: writing a test suite that satisfy a data-flow criterion is challenging due to the presence of many test objectives that include infeasible elements in the coverage domain and exclude feasible ones that depend on aliasing and dynamic constructs.  To improve the applicability and effectiveness of data-flow testing we need both to augment the precision of the coverage domain by including data-flow elements dependent on aliasing and to exclude infeasible ones that reduce the total coverage.  In my PhD research I plan to address these two problems by designing a new data-flow testing approach that combines automatic test generation and dynamic identification of data-flow elements that can identify precise test targets by monitoring the program executions.",

            "Abstract": "Process mining is to extract knowledge about business processes from data stored implicitly in ad-hoc way or explicitly by information systems. The aim is to discover runtime process, analyze performance and perform conformance verification, using process mining tools like ProM and Disco, for single software repository and processes spanning across multiple repositories. Application of process mining to software repositories has recently gained interest due to availability of vast data generated during software development and maintenance. Process data are embodied in repositories which can be used for analysis to improve the efficiency and capability of process, however, involves a lot of challenges which have not been addressed so far. Project team defines workflow, design process and policies for tasks like issue tracking (defect or feature enhancement), peer code review (review the submitted patch to avoid defects before they are injected) etc. to streamline and structure the activities. The reality may not be the same as defined because of imperfections so the extent of non-conformance needs to be measured. We propose a research framework `Nirikshan&#039; to process mine the data of software repositories from multiple perspectives like process, organizational, data and time. We apply process mining on software repositories to derive runtime process map, identify and remove inefficiencies and imperfections, extend the capabilities of existing software engineering tools to make them more process aware, and understand interaction pattern between various contributors to improve the efficiency of project.",

Developers have to deal with legacy and undocumented code that hinders the comprehension of the software system at hand. Enhancing program comprehension by means of recommender systems in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a solution to assist developers in these tasks. The recommender systems proposed so far generally share common weaknesses: they are not proactive, they consider a single type of data-source, and in case of multiple data-source, relevant items are suggested together without considering interactions among them. We envision a future where recommender systems follow a holistic approach: They provide knowledge regarding a programming context by considering information beyond the one provided by single elements in the context of the software development. The recommender system should consider different elements such as development artifact (e.g., bug reports, mailing lists), and online resources (e.g., blogs, Q&amp;A web sites, API documentation), developers activities, repository history etc. The provided information should be novel and emerge from the semantic links created by the analysis of the interactions among these elements.",

The many layers of generalised frameworks and libraries that these applications are typically assembled from leads to seemingly simple tasks requiring many thousands of operations to complete. Addressing these performance problems with traditional profiling tools is difficult because of the scale and complexity of the dynamic behaviour being exhibited. A wealth of detailed data is collected but costs are thinly distributed across thousands of methods leaving few easily identifiable performance optimisation opportunities. However we believe there are repeated patterns of method calls hidden within the profile data that represent performance critical sections of code. We plan to investigate new approaches to analysing typical performance data sets to identify these repeated patterns. Our initial work shows some promising results - being able to identify, within an application with over 64 thousand unique calling contexts, ten patterns that account for over 50% of the execution time.",

This study is part of an ongoing study being conducted at a CMMi Level 5 software company. The results so far indicate that there are differences in task processes followed by high and average productivity programmers, and that it may be possible to improve the productivity of average productivity programmers by training them to use the task processes followed by the high productivity programmers.",

In a typical industry setting any maintenance project spans three different phases; Transition, Steady-State and Preventive Maintenance. Each phase has different goals and drivers, but underlying software repositories or artifacts remain the same. To improve the overall efficiency of the process and people involved in these different phases, we require appropriate insights to be derived from the available software repositories. In the past decade considerable research has been done in mining software repositories and deriving insights, particularly focussed on open source softwares. However, focussed studies on enterprise software maintenance in an industrial setting is severely lacking.  In this thesis work, we intend to understand the industry needs on desired insights and limitations on available software artifacts across these different phases. Based on this understanding we intend to propose and develop novel methods and approaches for deriving desirable insights from software repositories. We also intend to leverage empirical techniques to validate our approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

Despite their wide adoption in mainstream programming languages, empirical evidence suggests that developers are still not properly using these mechanisms to achieve better software robustness. Without adequate support, developers struggle to decide the proper manner in which they should handle their exceptions, i.e., the place where the exception should be caught and the handling actions that should be implemented. As a consequence, they tend to ignore exceptions by implementing empty handlers or leaving them unhandled, which may ultimately lead to the introduction of faults in the source code. In this context, this PhD research aims at investigating means to improve the quality of exception handling in software projects. To achieve this goal, we propose a recommender system able to support developers in implementing exception handling.",

In particular, when maintaining a SPL feature, developers need to know which parts of other dependent features might be affected by this maintenance. Otherwise, further maintenance problems can be introduced in the SPL implementation. However, the identification and understanding of the so-called feature dependencies in the source code are an exhaustive and error-prone task. In fact, developers often ignore unconsciously feature dependencies while reasoning about SPL maintenance. To overcome this problem, this PhD research aims at understanding the properties of feature dependencies in the source code that exert impact on SPL maintenance. Furthermore, we propose a way to structure and segregate feature interfaces in order to help developers to identify and understand feature dependencies, thus reducing the effort and avoiding undesirable side effects in SPL maintenance.",

However, most modern development life-cycles and even run-time environments (as in the case of adaptive systems), are implicitly based on incompleteness and evolution. Incompleteness occurs when some parts of the system are not specified. Evolution concerns a set of gradual and progressive changes that amend systems over time.  Modern development life-cycles are founded on a sequence of iterative and incremental steps through which the initial incomplete description of the system evolves into its final, fully detailed, specification. Similarly, adaptive systems evolve through a set of adaptation actions, such as plugging and removing components, that modify the behavior of the system in response to new environmental conditions, requirements or legal regulations. Usually, the adaptation is performed by first removing old components, leaving the system temporarily unspecified-incomplete-, and then by plugging the new ones.  This work aims to extend classical verification algorithms to consider incomplete and evolving specifications. We want to ensure that after any change, only the part of the system that is affected by the change, is re-analyzed, avoiding to re-verify everything from scratch.",

As of today, the market for such devices features over 850K+ apps for Android, and 19 versions of the Android API have been released in 4 years. There is evidence that Android apps are highly dependent on the underlying APIs, and APIs instability (change proneness) and fault-proneness are a threat to the success of those apps. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create an approach that helps developers of Android apps to be better prepared for Android platform updates as well as the updates from third-party libraries that can potentially (and inadvertently) impact their apps with breaking changes and bugs. Thus, we hypothesize that the proposed approach will help developers not only deal with platform and library updates opportunely, but also keep (and increase) the user base by avoiding many of these potential API ”update” bugs",

A very broad class of such requirements are the ones that define quantitative properties of software systems. Properties of this kind are of key relevance to express quality of service. For example, they are used to specify bounds on the timing information between specific events, or on their number of occurrences. Sometimes, they are also used to express higher level properties such as aggregate values over the multiplicity of certain events in a specific time window. These are practical specification patterns that can be frequently found in system documentation. The goal of this thesis is to develop an approach for specifying and verifying quantitative properties of complex software systems that execute in a changing environment.

Companies and organizations have directly (or not) opened up their software platforms and assets to others, including partners and 3rd party developers, creating software ecosystems (SECOs). This scenario changes the traditional software industry because it requires mature research in SE dealing with an environment where business models and socio-technical networks can impact systems engineering and management, and reuse approaches. However, one strong inhibitor is the complexity in defining and modeling SECO elements to improve their comprehension and analysis. The main reason is the fact that this topic is emerging and no common sense on its concepts and relations exists yet. Thus, it is difficult to understand its real impacts in the SE industry. In this context, we propose an approach to support the definition, modeling and analysis of SECOs by exploring Software Reuse concepts in techniques in this area and treating nontechnical aspects in SE.",

Although accurate testing can discover many wrong behaviours, formal software verification techniques can help in developing applications that dependably satisfy their requirements. However, since formal verification techniques are time consuming and software changes continuously, incremental verification methods, i.e., methods which reuse the results of the verification of a previous version when verifying a new version of a program, are very useful, since they can significantly reduce the time required to perform the verification.  In this work I apply a syntactic-semantic incremental approach to reachability checking of KernelC programs using matching logic. KernelC is a significant, non-trivial subset of the C programming language. Matching logic is a language-independent proof system to reason about programs in any language that has a rewrite-based operational semantics. Incrementality is achieved by encoding the verification procedure in a syntax-driven fashion based on semantic attributes defined on top of an operator-precedence grammar.",

However, traditional requirements engineering methods and frameworks might not be sufficiently effective when dealing with new types of IoT heterogeneous systems. Therefore, building a methodological framework to model the privacy and security requirements specifications for IoT is necessary in order to deal with its mission critical nature. The purpose of this project is to develop such a requirements engineering framework in order to ensure proper development of IoT with security and privacy taken into account from the earliest stages.  abstract  D.2.1Software EngineeringRequirements/Specifications[Methodologies, Tools] Security  Internet of Things, RFID, privacy, security, requirements engineering, requirements elicitation  Introduction  The idea behind the Internet of Things (IoT) is to connect not only people and computer devices, but also everyday objects to the Internet. This can be achieved by equipping things with computing and communication abilities, thus entirely mapping the physical world to the digital one. This vision came from the fact that people have limitations in time and accuracy when it comes to data gathering and generating, but if these processes can be done without any human interference (i.e., by having uniquely identifiable objects to report their status, location, addresses, etc.), then the costs and losses will be reduced dramatically. The IoT has the potential to change the ways of working and living with its new aspects of communication and interaction, and innovative services and applications, e.g., real-time objects monitoring, search engine for things, etc. Atzori2010,Miorandi2012.  The IoT is exposed to significant privacy and security risks. They can themselves be used to both protect and violate individual&#039;s privacy and security. First, Atzori et al. Atzori2010 mentioned theft application as one of the potential applications of the IoT due to the reason that the existence of the IoT will make it possible to develop an application which sends out SMS messages immediately to users whenever their personal stuff (such as television or wallet) is moved from predefined locations without their permission.  Second, the architectural nature of the IoT, where billions of objects may interact with each other, will attract malicious attackers and eavesdroppers to collect data thus breaking privacy and security rules Roman2013. Hence, maintaining secure and private connections and transmission of information, in addition to prevent data collection are unquestionably crucial requirements to build up the IoT.  The most complex challenge from the requirements engineering perspective is the difficulty of specifying requirements, and security and privacy requirements in particular, for a system with so many components that can be randomly integrated in various systems at various times and places. For the IoT, it is difficult even to envision what system an object will be a part of. As such, we must develop a requirements framework that takes security and privacy into account both at the component level as well as a part of a system-of-systems.    IoT Components  The key components of the IoT are RFID systems and sensor networks Atzori2010: enumerate  RFID Systems Atzori2010,Buettner2008: The full deployment of the IoT relies on the widespread use of Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags to identify everyday objects, which enables the tracking ability of objects throughout space and time in a sustainable manner. RFID is considered as an enabling technology and it has a wide range of beneficial applications such as electronic toll collection systems, access management systems, airport baggage tracking logistics, etc. By using RFID, it is possible for an object to identify itself to another object, and on that account RFID systems form the basic structural unit of the IoT. RFID systems are composed of: itemize   uniquely identifiable tags that can be assigned to different objects. Each tag is able to receive a reader&#039;s signal, and it is able to transmit its ID back to the reader;   readers whose responsibility is to generate appropriate signals to receive tag IDs. itemize  It is worth mentioning that new tag technologies are being investigated i.e. chipless tags, to ensure interpretability and data security and to reduce the production cost Tedjini2010.   Sensor Networks: They are currently used in various fields like e-health, military and industry. Each sensor network consists of a large number of sensing nodes, in addition to a special node called sink, where the sink node is used to collect sensing results reported by other nodes in the network. Because such networks can cooperate with RFID systems to enhance objects tracking, sensor networks have a significant role in the IoT development.   Several studies have been performed in order to solve the current issues of sensor networks Akyildiz2002. For example, in Said2013, Said et al. suggested a new Effective Data Aggregation Protocol (DAP) that addresses the limited capabilities of sensor networks: energy consumption, small memory size, scalability, etc. enumerate    Security Requirements Framework  Although a number of recent studies have addressed the privacy and security challenges in the IoT Roman2013,Miorandi2012, most of them were from the low-level networking perspective. We could not find any studies about system-level issues or any frameworks that deals with these challenges at the requirements and system level.  In our preliminary analysis, we identified the following obstacles to defining and analyzing IoT privacy and security requirements: enumerate  It is very challenging to determine what information should be protected, when to protect it and to whom access should be granted/restricted.  The IoT consists of diverse technologies and the integration of these technologies leads to unknown risks and issues Sutcliffe2013.  The changing nature of the environment plays an important role when dealing with the privacy and security vulnerabilities of the IoT. enumerate   To overcome these problems, it is necessary to develop a framework which achieves the following goals: itemize  analyze users interactions with the IoT in real time in order to provide a set of privacy and security requirements to be fulfilled through the self-adaptive and self-healing nature of the IoT;  expose misunderstandings and find out if there are any conflicts between privacy and security requirements and other requirements (functionality, usability and reliability);  manage complexity and validate the behavior of the IoT in different applications and domains such as e-health, in order to identify potential security and privacy threats. itemize  In the first stage of our work, we will focus on goal elicitation and modeling in order to develop the preliminary IoT system goal models, describe relationships among agents as a pre-requisite to agent-oriented systems modeling in order to deal with conflicting and competing goals Yu2001,yu2002,Liu2003. In particular, we will use the i* framework Yu2001, and apply it on a IoT case study (smart grid metering infrastructure as an example of IoT). We will perform an extensive analysis and evaluation of the case study results.   In the second stage of our work, we will develop extension to i* framework based on the evaluation of the results from the first stage. In particular, it will be necessary to improve the framework so that it: itemize  provides in-depth investigation of expected privacy and security vulnerabilities in the IoT;  elicits, identifies, and analyzes privacy and security requirements in a systematic fashion, taking into account the dynamic features of the IoT. itemize   In summary, analyzing security and privacy requirements in complex systems, such as the IoT systems, is essential in preventing failures and ensuring wider customer acceptance. The i* framework is a well accepted modeling framework and a good candidate for a case study evaluation and further improvements necessary to support IoT systems development. We will particularly focus on tackling IoT specific challenges such as the inter-agent communication, system&#039;s complexity and scalability, etc. that are not supported well by i* framework Franch2012. This in turn will lead towards a better understanding of the IoT development challenges, and open the future research directions in IoT software architecture design, IoT testing methods, etc. Overall tight integration and adaptation of software engineering methods will improve our ability to tackle development challenges due to the IoT heterogeneity, limited computational power, network communication overload, distribution, etc.   abbrv sigproc document",

            "Abstract": "At the end of the second millennium, mobility was a hot research topic. Physical mobility of devices was becoming commonplace with the availability of cheap wireless cards, the first attempts to transform phones into personal do-it-all devices were beginning to appear, and mobile ad hoc networks were attracting a huge interest from many research communities. Logical mobility of code was still going strong as a design option for distributed systems, with the Java language providing some of the ready-to-use building blocks. In 2000, when we put forth a research “roadmap” for software engineering for mobility, the challenges posed by this dynamic scenario were many. A decade and a half later, many things have changed. Mobility is no longer exotic: we juggle multiple personal devices every day while on the move, plus we grab and update applications on a whim from virtual stores. Indeed, some trends and visions we considered in our original paper materialized, while others faded, disappeared, or morphed into something else. Moreover, some players unexpected at the time (e.g., cloud computing and online social networks) appeared on the scene as game changers. In this paper we revisit critically our original vision, reflecting on the past and peering into the future of the lively and exciting research area of mobility. Further, we ask ourselves to what extent the software engineering community is still interested in taking up the challenges mobility bears.",

Required in safety-critical systems by many certifying bodies, such as the USA Federal Aviation Authority, software traceability is an essential element of the software development process. In practice, traceability is often conducted in an ad-hoc, after-the-fact manner and, therefore, its benefits are not always fully realized. Over the past decade, researchers have focused on specific areas of the traceability problem, developing more sophisticated tooling, promoting strategic planning, applying information retrieval techniques capable of semi-automating the trace creation and maintenance process, developing new trace query languages and visualization techniques that use trace links, and applying traceability in specific domains such as Model Driven Development, product line systems, and agile project environments. In this paper, we build upon a prior body of work to highlight the state-of-the-art in software traceability, and to present compelling areas of research that need to be addressed.",

Similar data is now becoming widely available in other domains. Software systems that utilize such operational data (OD) to help with software design and maintenance activities are increasingly being built despite the difficulties of drawing valid conclusions from disparate and low-quality data and the continuing evolution of operational support tools. This paper proposes systematizing approaches to the engineering of OD-based systems. To prioritize and structure research areas we consider historic developments, such as big data hype; synthesize defining features of OD, such as confounded measures and unobserved context; and discuss emerging new applications, such as diverse and large OD collections and extremely short development intervals. To sustain the credibility of OD-based systems more research will be needed to investigate effective existing approaches and to synthesize novel, OD-specific engineering principles.",

            "Abstract": "Software developers rely on media to communicate, learn, collaborate, and coordinate with others. Recently, social media has dramatically changed the landscape of software engineering, challenging some old assumptions about how developers learn and work with one another. We see the rise of the social programmer who actively participates in online communities and openly contributes to the creation of a large body of crowdsourced socio-technical content.  In this paper, we examine the past, present, and future roles of social media in software engineering. We provide a review of research that examines the use of different media channels in software engineering from 1968 to the present day. We also provide preliminary results from a large survey with developers that actively use social media to understand how they communicate and collaborate, and to gain insights into the challenges they face. We find that while this particular population values social media, traditional channels, such as face-to-face communication, are still considered crucial. We synthesize findings from our historical review and survey to propose a roadmap for future research on this topic. Finally, we discuss implications for research methods as we argue that social media is poised to bring about a paradigm shift in software engineering research.",

Our goal, in this paper, is to provide an accounting of some of the most successful research performed in software testing since the year 2000, and to present what appear to be some of the most significant challenges and opportunities in this area. To be more inclusive in this effort, and to go beyond our own personal opinions and biases, we began by contacting over 50 of our colleagues who are active in the testing research area, and asked them what they believed were (1) the most significant contributions to software testing since 2000 and (2) the greatest open challenges and opportunities for future research in this area. While our colleagues’ input (consisting of about 30 responses) helped guide our choice of topics to cover and ultimately the writing of this paper, we by no means claim that our paper represents all the relevant and noteworthy research performed in the area of software testing in the time period considered—a task that would require far more space and time than we have available. Nevertheless, we hope that the approach we followed helps this paper better reflect not only our views, but also those of the software testing community in general.",

This constant change constitutes software evolution. Software evolution has gained steadily in importance and recently moved into the center of attention of software developers. There is the new prominence of evolutionary software development that includes agile, iterative, open source, inner source, and other processes. As a consequence, the bulk of software development now happens in the stage of software evolution and this changed the face of software engineering. This paper discusses evolutionary software development and also discusses the software change, which is the fundamental software evolution task. It further discusses research methodologies, teaching software evolution in undergraduate curriculum, and difference between software evolution and software maintenance. For all these themes, this travelogue paper presents the current state of the art and the perspective of the future advance.",

            "Abstract": "Software poses a range of engineering challenges. How do we capture the expected behavior of the software? How can we check if such behavioral descriptions are consistent and valid? How do we generate test instances that explore and examine different parts of the software. We focus on the underlying technology by which a number of these problems can be reduced to a logical form and answered using automated deduction. In the first part we briefly summarize the use of automated deduction within software engineering. Then we consider some of the current and future trends in software engineering and the type of advances it may require from automated deduction. We observe that in the past software engineering problems were solved by merely leveraging advances in automated deduction, especially in SAT and SMT solving, whereas we are now entering a phase where advances in automated deduction are also driven by software engineering requirements.",

            "Abstract": "Probabilistic programs are usual functional or imperative programs with two added constructs: (1) the ability to draw values at random from distributions, and (2) the ability to condition values of variables in a program via observations. Models from diverse application areas such as computer vision, coding theory, cryptographic protocols, biology and reliability analysis can be written as probabilistic programs.  Probabilistic inference is the problem of computing an explicit representation of the probability distribution implicitly specified by a probabilistic program. Depending on the application, the desired output from inference may vary---we may want to estimate the expected value of some function f with respect to the distribution, or the mode of the distribution, or simply a set of samples drawn from the distribution.  In this paper, we describe connections this research area called ``Probabilistic Programming&quot; has with programming languages and software engineering, and this includes language design, and the static and dynamic analysis of programs. We survey current state of the art and speculate on promising directions for future research.",

            "Abstract": "The amount and impact of software-dependence in critical systems impinging on daily life is increasing rapidly. In many of these systems, inadequate software and systems engineering can lead to economic disaster, injuries or death. Society generally does not recognize the potential of losses from deficiencies of systems due to software until after some mishap occurs. Then there is an outcry, reflecting societal expectations; however, few know what it takes to achieve the expected safety and, in general, loss-prevention.  On the one hand there are unprecedented, exponential increases in size, inter-dependencies, intricacies, numbers and variety in the systems and distribution of development processes across organizations and cultures. On the other hand, industry&#039;s capability to verify and validate these systems has not kept up. Mere compliance with existing standards, techniques, and regulations cannot guarantee the safety properties of these systems. The gap between practice and capability is increasing rapidly.  This paper considers the future of software engineering as needed to support development and certification of safety-critical software-dependent systems. We identify a collection of challenges and document their current state, the desired state, gaps and barriers to reaching the desired state, and potential directions in software engineering research and education that could address the gaps and barriers.",

            "Abstract": "End-user software engineering (EUSE) is a research area that aims to invent new kinds of technologies that collaborate with end users to improve the quality of their software. The practice that EUSE research aims to support is end users using new tools and methods to improve the quality of the software that they and other end users have created. There is a need for this outcome because research shows both that the number of end users creating their own software greatly exceeds the number of professional software developers, and that the software they create is riddled with errors. In this paper, we describe the present state of EUSE, and challenges in moving forward toward a bright future. We show how the future of EUSE may become over-siloed, restricting future researchers&#039; vision of what can be achieved. We then show that focusing on the in-the-moment intents of end-user developers can be used to derive a number of promising directions forward for EUSE researchers, and how theories can help us further de-silo future EUSE research. Finally, we discuss how overcoming challenges for the future of end-user software engineering may also bring direct benefits to the future of &quot;classic&quot; software engineering.",

            "Abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are a recent development in online education aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the Web. They are a potentially disruptive technology, changing how education is delivered and funded around the world. MOOCs are relevant to software researchers and practitioners, not only because they will increasingly receive lifelong education through MOOCs and related technologies, but also because content creation, delivery, and enhancement of MOOCs is evolving into a new form of socially- and cognitively-embedded software development. This paper discusses how education is being enhanced by MOOCs and other digital learning technology.  In particular, we distinguish the free educational content provided by MOOCs from the emerging collaborative processes through which MOOCs are created, which is arguably more transformative on education than the content itself. We discuss blended models of higher education to suit different learner communities, as well as nascent moves toward the creation of instructional communities of educators that transcend institutional boundaries. We also explore MOOCs and their evolution as a subject for research in the learning sciences and implications for R&amp;D in software and systems engineering.",
