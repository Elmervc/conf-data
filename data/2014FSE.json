            "Abstract": "Emerging technologies that deliver automation increasingly rely on sharing sensitive personal information, which can introduce new threats to personal privacy. To address these new risks, regulators and privacy advocates have called for &quot;Privacy By Design&quot; to build privacy into systems early in the software-development lifecycle. There are several challenges to this call: first, the established definitions of privacy describe factors outside the traditional system boundary that software developers typically consider; second, in contrast to security, the risk model that underpins privacy is exogenous, contextual and anthropic, which is profoundly different from traditional views of system risk; and third, maximizing privacy in systems will necessarily reduce information utility, which either safely constrains design or dangerously precludes some systems by destabilizing their desired operating principles. In this session, we will discuss these challenges in the context of Walter Vincenti&#039;s design instrumentalities with examples drawn from surveillance technology applied in social networking, recommender systems and mobile applications. Proposals for addressing these challenges will be discussed in the context of emerging research in privacy and software engineering.",

            "Abstract": "A huge wealth of various data exists in the practice of software development. Further rich data are produced by modern software and services in operation, many of which tend to be data-driven and/or data-producing in nature. Hidden in the data is information about the quality of software and services, user experiences, as well as the dynamics of software development. Software analytics is to develop and apply data exploration and analysis technologies, such as pattern recognition, machine learning, and information visualization, on software data in order to empower software practitioners to obtain insightful and actionable information for modern software and services. This 90-minute tutorial presents achievements and challenges of research and practice on principles, techniques, and applications of software analytics, highlighting success stories in industry, research achievements that have transferred to industrial practice, and future directions in software analytics. Attendees will acquire the skills and knowledge needed to perform research or conduct practice in the field of software analytics and to integrate analytics in their own research, practice, or teaching.",

            "Abstract": "Security is a tough reality for software engineers today. Software products that are maliciously abused can undermine the many activities of our modern, digital world. The software that we depend upon must be secure, or we are at risk not just as “users”, but as consumers, patients, and citizens. The daily grind for a software engineer is already heavy: understanding customer requirements, collaborating in large teams, learning new technologies, fixing bugs, and delivering new features on time. All of these activities involve a mindset of “building” software, yet security is about “breaking” software. To a customer, software is supposed to transparently improve their lives. To a malicious hacker, software is an opportunity to abuse functionality for malicious gain. As a result, software engineers must maintain both the “builder” mindset as well as the “breaker” mindset throughout the software-development lifecycle. In this tutorial, we will examine how security can be integrated into each step of the software-development lifecycle. We will also discuss recent trends in Engineering Secure Software, such as evidence-based engineering of secure software and the effects of catastrophic vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed.",

            "Abstract": "String manipulation is a crucial part of modern software systems; for example, it is used extensively in input validation and sanitization and in dynamic code and query generation. The goal of string-analysis techniques is to determine the set of values that string expressions can take during program execution. String analysis can be used to solve many problems in modern software systems that relate to string manipulation, such as: (1) Identifying security vulnerabilities by checking if a security sensitive function can receive an input string that contains an exploit; (2) Identifying behaviors of JavaScript code that use the eval function by computing the string values that can reach the eval function; (3) Identifying html generation errors by computing the html code generated by web applications; (4) Identifying the set of queries that are sent to back-end database by analyzing the code that generates the SQL queries; (5) Patching input validation and sanitization functions by automatically synthesizing repairs. Like many other program-analysis problems, it is not possible to solve the string analysis problem precisely (i.e., it is not possible to precisely determine the set of string values that can reach a program point). However, one can compute over- or under-approximations of possible string values. If the approximations are precise enough, they can enable us to demonstrate existence or absence of bugs in string manipulating code. String analysis has been an active research area in the last decade, resulting in a wide variety of string-analysis techniques. In this tutorial, we will discuss automated string-analysis techniques, focusing particularly on automata-based static string analysis. We plan to cover the following topics: computing pre and post-conditions of basic string operations using automata, symbolic representation of automata, forward and backward string analysis using symbolic automata representation, relational string analysis, vulnerability detection using string analysis, differential string analysis, and automated repair using string analysis.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, there have been significant advances in symbolic execution technology, driven by the increasing maturity of SMT and SAT solvers as well as by the availability of cheap compute resources. This technology has had a significant impact in the area of automatically finding bugs in software. In this tutorial, we will review ways in which symbolic execution can be used not just for finding bugs in programs, but also in debugging them! In current practice, once a failure-inducing input has been found, humans have to spend a great deal of effort in determining the root cause of the bug. The reason the task is complicated is that a person has to figure out manually how the execution of the program on the failure-inducing input deviated from the “intended” execution of the program. We will show that symbolic analysis can be used to help the human in this task in a variety of ways. In particular, symbolic execution helps to glean the intended program behavior. We will show that this ability of symbolic execution in extracting program specifications can help in automating program repair as well. Concretely, the tutorial will provide a background in symbolic execution, and then cover material from a series of recent papers on determination of root cause of errors and their repair using symbolic techniques; some of these papers are listed below. This is an emerging area, and the tutorial will point out several opportunities where additional research is needed to make this technology ready for field usage. This tutorial will attempt to further link up the software-engineering community with the programming-languages and formal-methods communities, in the specific context of software debugging and repair.",

            "Abstract": "Cyberphysical systems (CPSs) are networked embedded systems tightly coupled with the physical world, built out of resource-constrained devices equipped with sensors and actuators. Because of the resulting intimate interactions between the world and the machine, developing CPS software brings many SE challenges to an extreme. The sheer number of computing units, the heterogeneity of the systems, the need to integrate into larger computing infrastructures, and the increasing demand for self-adaptive operation require simple solutions to complex problems, able to tame the environment dynamics within limited resources. Existing contributions are, however, scattered across diverse research communities, including software engineering, embedded and real-time distributed systems, sensor networks, and low-power wireless networking. The tutorial aims at providing a systematic, yet succinct overview of existing efforts in the field of developing CPS software. The tutorial will cover topics such as i) paradigmatic CPS applications and related (non-)functional requirements; ii) real-time low-power wireless sensing and actuation; iii) design and modelling approaches for CPS; iv) automatic program synthesis, programming abstractions, and middleware; and v) validation and verification of CPS software. The material will cover both theoretical aspects and their applications to real-world scenarios. The tutorial is aimed at fresh students looking for interesting problems, researchers wanting to gain deeper insights into CPS software, and practitioners in search of a systematic overview on the topic. In a broader perspective, the tutorial is a step towards creating increased awareness within the SE community about the challenges in this specific field.",

While journals and conferences were once the only way to disseminate research results, today we can use blogs, Twitter, and open platforms like ﬁgshare. But how to incorporate these social media—dubbed Science 2.0—into your scientiﬁc process? Maybe you want to start but don’t know how, or you don’t know where to ﬁnd the time. In this tutorial, we will present hands-on tips to start with social media immediately and use platforms like Twitter, Hackernews, or Reddit for their research. We present useful tools, resources, and practices from current research that will help researchers new to social media get started. Since social media can also easily become overwhelming, we will also discuss strategies for handling information overload and other challenges. While this tutorial is mainly aimed at beginners, it will also include interesting tips and tricks for researchers already using social media.",

            "Abstract": "Clouds and cloud computing is becoming a household term, yet a surprising number of applications are essentially not &quot;cloud-ready&quot;. Some are existing large and complex applications engineered to protect their intellectual property (e.g., via CPU lock-in), and some are applications intended to run on a &quot;cloud&quot; but were implemented without an understanding of how clouds work. Issues range from deficiencies in application/software mobility, to security issues, to multi-tenancy issues, to performance issues, to licensing issues, to reliability, and so on. This tutorial presents the concept of clouds, essential cloud services, functionalities, and sub-systems, and it reviews existing cloud architectures. It then discusses principles and techniques that can be used to develop cloud-resident software. We will briefly cover metrics and check-lists that allow software developers to understand what a particular commercial or open-source cloud provides, and what the pitfalls and risks might be with a particular cloud. Special attention will be paid to ways of minimizing mismatch (and the resulting issues) between software intended to run on a cloud and the underlying cloud services and architecture. Attendees will gain an understanding of how to develop cloud-based applications, and which software-engineering processes and tools may be available and suitable, and which should or should not be used, to develop cloud applications.",

            "Abstract": "The key challenges of the model-driven approach to designing multi-clocked embedded systems are three-fold: (1) how to model local synchronous components and asynchronous communication between components in a single framework, (2) how to ensure the correctness of the model, and (3) how to maintain the consistency between the model and the implementation of the system. In this paper, we present Tsmart, a self-contained toolkit to address these three challenges. Tsmart seamlessly integrates (1) a graphical editor to facilitate the modeling of the complex behaviors and structures in an embedded system, (2) a simulator for interactive graphical simulation to understand and debug the system model, (3) a verication engine to verify the correctness of the system design, and (4) a synthesis engine to automatically generate ecient executable VHDL code from the model. The toolkit has been successfully applied to designing the main control system of a train communication controller, and the system has already been deployed and in operation. The evaluation of Tsmart on this real industrial application demonstrates the eectiveness and the potential of the toolkit.",

As a consequence, they commonly have to coordinate with other systems via complex message communication while realizing safety-critical and real-time tasks. As a result, those systems should be correct by construction. Software architects can achieve this by using the MechatronicUML process and language. This paper presents the MechatronicUML Tool Suite that offers unique features to support the MechatronicUML modeling and analyses tasks.",

            "Abstract": "Choreographies are an emergent Service Engineering (SE) approach to compose together and coordinate services in a distributed way. A choreography formalizes the way business participants coordinate their interactions. The focus is not on orchestrations of the work performed within them, but rather on the exchange of messages between these participants. The problems usually addressed when considering a choreography-based specification of the system to be realized are realizability check, and conformance check. In this paper we describe the CHOReOSynt tool, which has been conceived to deal with an additional problem, namely, automated choreography enforcement. That is, when the goal is to actually realize a service choreography by reusing third-party services, their uncontrolled (or wrongly coordinated) composite behavior may show undesired interactions that preclude the choreography realization. CHOReOSynt solves this problem by automatically synthesizing additional software entities that, when interposed among the services, allow for preventing undesired interactions.

In this work, we present a toolkit RaPiD for the reliability analysis of non-deterministic systems. Taking Markov decision process as reliability model, RaPiD can help in the analysis of three fundamental and rewarding aspects regarding software reliability. First, to have reliability assurance on a system, RaPiD can synthesize the overall system reliability given the reliability values of system components. Second, given a requirement on the overall system reliability, RaPiD can distribute the reliability requirement to each component. Lastly, RaPiD can identify the component that affects the system reliability most significantly. RaPiD has been applied to analyze several real-world systems including a financial stock trading system, a proton therapy control system and an ambient assisted living room system.",

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of OMEN+ that takes a multithreaded library as the input and detects true deadlocks in a scalable manner. We achieve this by automatically synthesizing relevant multithreaded tests and analyze the associated execution traces using a precise deadlock detector. We validate the usefulness of OMEN+ by applying it on many multithreaded Java libraries and detect a number of deadlocks even in documented thread-safe libraries.

This paper presents SketchLink, a tool that aims at increasing the value of sketches and diagrams created during software development by supporting developers in these tasks. Our prototype implementation provides a web application that employs the camera of smartphones and tablets to capture analog sketches, but can also be used on desktop computers to upload, for instance, computer-generated diagrams.

However, spreadsheets are error-prone: several reports exist of companies that have lost big sums of money due to spreadsheet errors. In previous work, spreadsheet smells have proven to be the cause of some of these errors. To that end, we have developed a tool that can apply refactorings to spreadsheet formulas, implementing our previous work on spreadsheet refactoring, which showed that spreadsheet formula smells are very common and that refactorings for them are widely applicable and that refactoring them with a tool is both quicker and less error-prone. Our new tool Bumblebee is able to execute refactorings originating from both these papers, by means of an extensible syntax, and can furthermore apply refactorings on entire groups of formulas, thus improving upon the existing tool RefBook. Finally, BumbleBee can also execute transformations other than refactorings.",

It first detects the types and locations of refactoring edits by comparing two program versions.

By helping developers be aware of deviations from pure refactoring edits, RefDistiller can help developers have high confidence about the correctness of manual refactoring edits.

            "Abstract": "During peer code reviews, developers often examine program differences. When using existing program differencing tools, it is difficult for developers to inspect systematic changes—similar, related changes that are scattered across multiple files. Developers cannot easily answer questions such as &quot;what other code locations changed similar to this change?&quot; and &quot;are there any other locations that are similar to this code but are not updated?&quot; In this paper, we demonstrate Critics, an Eclipse plug-in that assists developers in inspecting systematic changes. It (1) allows developers to customize a context-aware change template, (2) searches for systematic changes using the template, and (3) detects missing or inconsistent edits. Developers can interactively refine the customized change template to see corresponding search results. Critics has potential to improve developer productivity in inspecting large, scattered edits during code reviews.

Our tool has been used to analyze dozens of large-scale industrial projects, and has demonstrated its ability to provide valuable direction on which parts of the architecture are problematic, and on why, when, and how to refactor.

            "Abstract": "To manage bugs that appear in a software, developers often make use of a bug tracking system such as Bugzilla. Users can report bugs that they encounter in such a system. Whenever a user reports a new bug report, developers need to read the summary and description of the bug report and manually locate the buggy files based on this information. This manual process is often time consuming and tedious. Thus, a number of past studies have proposed bug localization techniques to automatically recover potentially buggy files from bug reports. Unfortunately, none of these techniques are integrated to bug tracking systems and thus it hinders their adoption by practitioners. To help disseminate research in bug localization to practitioners, we develop a tool named BugLocalizer, which is implemented as a Bugzilla extension and builds upon a recently proposed bug localization technique. Our tool extracts texts from summary and description fields of a bug report and source code files. It then computes similarities of the bug report with source code files to find the buggy files. Developers can use our tool online from a Bugzilla web interface by providing a link to a git source code repository and specifying the version of the repository to be analyzed. We have released our tool publicly in GitHub, which is available at: https://github.com/smagsmu/buglocalizer. We have also provided a demo video, which can be accessed at: http://youtu.be/iWHaLNCUjBY.",

Therefore, crashing faults mostly are required to be fixed with a high priority. Diagnosing crashing faults on production software is non-trivial, due to the characteristics of production environment. In general, it is required to address two major challenges. First, crash reports in production software are usually numerous, since production software is used by a large number of end users in various environments and configurations. Especially, a single fault may manifest as different crash reports, which makes the prioritizing debugging and understanding faults difficult. Second, deployed software is required to run with minimal overhead and cannot afford a heavyweight instrumentation approach to collect program execution information. Furthermore, end users require that the logged information should not reveal sensitive production data. This thesis contributes for developing crashing fault diagnosis tools that can be used in production environment.",

Second, the traceability information models between formalized safety requirements and programs are built.

Properties of a software can be divided into two categories: functional properties and non-functional properties. Properties that influence the input-output relationship of the software can be categorized as functional properties. On the other hand, properties that do not influence the input-output relationship of the software directly can be categorized as non-functional properties. In context of real-time system software, testing functional as well as non functional properties is equally important. Over the years considerable amount of research effort has been dedicated in developing tools and techniques that systematically test various functional properties of a software. However, the same cannot be said about testing non-functional properties. Systematic testing of non-functional properties is often much more challenging than testing functional properties. This is because non-functional properties not only depends on the inputs to the program but also on the underlying hardware. Additionally, unlike the functional properties, nonfunctional properties are seldom annotated in the software itself. Such challenges provide the objectives for this work. The primary objective of this work is to explore and address the major challenges in testing non-functional properties of a software.",

Defining non-functional requirements can end up in a major undertaking consuming significant resources. Even after defining non-functional requirements, chances are they do not reflect the real-world usage of a deployed system. Differences can occur due to workload, hardware, or utilised third-party libraries. To tackle these challenges we propose a fully automatic compliance monitoring solution for non-functional properties. The proposed system mines stable behavioural patterns of the system and automatically extracts assertions that can be used to detect deviations of expected non-functional behaviour. We especially focus on non-functional properties that require runtime observation, e.g. execution time, performance, throughput.The full automation of the process enables a deployment in the field, giving rise to a distributed non-functional behaviour extraction system.",

            "Abstract": "Testing stateful applications is challenging, as it can be difficult to identify hidden dependencies on program state. These dependencies may manifest between several test cases, or simply within a single test case. When it&#039;s left to developers to document, understand, and respond to these dependencies, a mistake can result in unexpected and invalid test results. Although current testing infrastructure does not currently leverage state dependency information, we argue that it could, and that by doing so testing can be improved. Our results thus far show that by recovering dependencies between test cases and modifying the popular testing framework, JUnit, to utilize this information, we can optimize the testing process, reducing time needed to run tests by 62% on average. Our ongoing work is to apply similar analyses to improve existing state of the art test suite prioritization techniques and state of the art test case generation techniques.",

            "Abstract": "Inexperienced software developers - for example, undergraduates entering the workforce - exhibit a lack of testing skills. They have trouble understanding and applying basic testing techniques. These inexperienced developers are hired by software companies, where this lack of testing skills has already been recognized. Companies allocate valuable resources and invest time and money in different onboarding strategies to introduce new hires to the organization’s testing practices. However, if the lack of testing skills is not addressed properly, the new hire is left to her own devices. This hinders her in becoming a high-quality engineer for the software company. This thesis proposes to improve the onboarding strategies with traits of social transparency in order to specifically address testing issues of inexperienced new hires. Social transparency has been shown to influence the testing behavior of development teams on a social coding site. An environment that is open for discussion helps newcomers to understand and adapt a team’s testing culture. Tailoring the onboarding process to better address testing skills of new hires makes it more effective and more efficient. This reduces the danger of carrying new hire’s testing deficits into commercial software development.",

            "Abstract": "Software conflicts arising because of conflicting changes are a regular occurrence and delay projects. Workspace awareness tools have been proposed to facilitate task coordination among developers, enabling them to identify potential conflicts early, while conflicts are still easy to resolve. However, these tools have limitations, as they identify conflicts after conflicts have already occurred and therefore, are unable to prevent developers’ time and effort spent in resolving the conflicts. The goal of this Ph.D. research is to: (1) characterize the distribution of conflicts, their frequency and the factors within a project that affects the distribution and frequency of conflicts, (2) design and implement a conflict minimization technique that proactively identifies potential conflicts by analyzing developers’ tasks and avoids them by scheduling tasks in a conflict minimal manner and (3) evaluate the proposed approach using historic data from OSS projects and through user evaluations. Thus far, we have implemented our approach and evaluated it with historic data from four OSS projects and through simulated data.",

If you work for a company, your (curmudgeonly) manager now wants to see its “impact” on the business. This is the part where you have to convince someone else to use your shiny new tool in their day-to-day work, or ship it as a product. But you soon realize that getting traction with developers or product managers is significantly harder than the research itself. Sounds familiar? In the past several years, I have been involved in taking a variety of software productivity tools to various constituencies within a company: internal users, product teams, and service delivery teams. In this talk, I will share my experiences in interacting with these constituencies; sometimes successful experiences, but at other times not so successful ones. I will focus broadly on tools in two areas: bug finding and test automation. I will make some observations on when tech transfer works and when it stumbles.",

The keynote reflects on what it in practise means to be evidence-based in software engineering contexts, where the number of different contexts is high and the research-based evidence sparse, and why there is a need for more evidence-based practises. We summarise our experience from ten years of Evidence-Based Software Engineering in the context of university courses, training of software engineers and systematic literature reviews of software engineering research. While there are challenges in training people in evidence-based practise, our experience suggest that it is feasible and that the training can make an important difference in terms of quality of software engineering judgment and decisions. Based on our experience we suggest changes in how evidence-based software engineering should be presented and taught, and how we should ease the transfer of research results into evidence-based practises.",

This talk describes a new anti-data monetization movement led by Omlet, an open messaging service and distributed computing platform that spun out of 4 years of research at Stanford University. With Omlet, (1) users can own their data and have them hosted on cloud services of their choice and (2) distributed &quot;p2p webapps&quot; enable phones and other internet of things to interact with each other without having its communication be monetized. Introduced in March 2014, Omlet is already seeing traction, as it is being distributed on millions of Android phones, by Asus and other yet-to-be-announced device makers. This paradigm shift to decentralized computation not only safeguards users&#039; data privacy, it fosters open competition and innovation, and provides an efficient and scalable foundation to handle the billions of phones and devices. Software engineering researchers can help make this a reality by making distributed mobile app development on such a platform accessible.",

            "Abstract": "To complete a change task, software developers spend a substantial amount of time navigating code to understand the relevant parts. During this investigation phase, they implicitly build context models of the elements and relations that are relevant to the task. Through an exploratory study with twelve developers completing change tasks in three open source systems, we identified important characteristics of these context models and how they are created. In a second empirical analysis, we further examined our findings on data collected from eighty developers working on a variety of change tasks on open and closed source projects. Our studies uncovered, amongst other results, that code context models are highly connected, structurally and lexically, that developers start tasks using a combination of search and navigation and that code navigation varies substantially across developers. Based on these findings we identify and discuss design requirements to better support developers in the initial creation of code context models. We believe this work represents a substantial step in better understanding developers&#039; code navigation and providing better tool support that will reduce time and effort needed for change tasks.",

            "Abstract": "The better the software development community becomes at creating software, the more software the world seems to demand. Although there is a large body of research about measuring and investigating productivity from an organizational point of view, there is a paucity of research about how software developers, those at the front-line of software construction, think about, assess and try to improve their productivity. To investigate software developers&#039; perceptions of software development productivity, we conducted two studies: a survey with 379 professional software developers to help elicit themes and an observational study with 11 professional software developers to investigate emergent themes in more detail. In both studies, we found that developers perceive their days as productive when they complete many or big tasks without significant interruptions or context switches. Yet, the observational data we collected shows our participants performed significant task and activity switching while still feeling productive. We analyze such apparent contradictions in our findings and use the analysis to propose ways to better support software developers in a retrospection and improvement of their productivity through the development of new tools and the sharing of best practices.",

            "Abstract": "There are many different approaches to testing software, with different benefits for software quality and the development process. Yet, it is not well understood what developers struggle with when getting started with testing - and why some do not test at all or not as much as would be good for their project. This missing understanding keeps us from improving processes and tools to help novices adopt proper testing practices. We conducted a qualitative study with 97 computer science students. Through interviews, we explored their experiences and attitudes regarding testing in a collaborative software project. We found enabling and inhibiting factors for testing activities, the different testing strategies they used, and novices’ perceptions and attitudes of testing. Students push test automation to the end of the project, thus robbing themselves from the advantages of having a test suite during implementation. Students were not convinced of the return of investment in automated tests and opted for laborious manual tests - which they often regretted in the end. Understanding such challenges and opportunities novices face when confronted with adopting testing can help us improve testing processes, company policies, and tools. Our findings provide recommendations that can enable organizations to facilitate the adoption of testing practices by their members.",

            "Abstract": "Providing feedback on programming assignments manually is a tedious, error prone, and time-consuming task. In this paper, we motivate and address the problem of generating feedback on performance aspects in introductory programming assignments. We studied a large number of functionally correct student solutions to introductory programming assignments and observed: (1) There are different algorithmic strategies, with varying levels of efficiency, for solving a given problem. These different strategies merit different feedback. (2) The same algorithmic strategy can be implemented in countless different ways, which are not relevant for reporting feedback on the student program. We propose a light-weight programming language extension that allows a teacher to define an algorithmic strategy by specifying certain key values that should occur during the execution of an implementation. We describe a dynamic analysis based approach to test whether a student&#039;s program matches a teacher&#039;s specification. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of both our specification language and our dynamic analysis. On one of our benchmarks consisting of 2316 functionally correct implementations to 3 programming problems, we identified 16 strategies that we were able to describe using our specification language (in 95 minutes after inspecting 66, i.e., around 3%, implementations). Our dynamic analysis correctly matched each implementation with its corresponding specification, thereby automatically producing the intended feedback.",

            "Abstract": "Finding and fixing bugs are time-consuming activities in software development. Spectrum-based fault localization aims to identify the faulty position in source code based on the execution trace of test cases. Failing test cases and their assertions form test oracles for the failing behavior of the system under analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of spectrum driven test case purification for improving fault localization. The goal of test case purification is to separate existing test cases into small fractions (called purified test cases) and to enhance the test oracles to further localize faults. Combining with an original fault localization technique (e.g., Tarantula), test case purification results in better ranking the program statements. Our experiments on 1800 faults in six open-source Java programs show that test case purification can effectively improve existing fault localization techniques.",

            "Abstract": "Recent research has made significant progress in automatic patch generation, an approach to repair programs with less or no manual intervention. However, direct deployment of auto-generated patches remains difficult, for reasons such as patch quality variations and developers&#039; intrinsic resistance. In this study, we take one step back and investigate a more feasible application scenario of automatic patch generation, that is, using generated patches as debugging aids. We recruited 95 participants for a controlled experiment, in which they performed debugging tasks with the aid of either buggy locations (i.e., the control group), or generated patches of varied qualities. We observe that: a) high-quality patches significantly improve debugging correctness; b) such improvements are more obvious for difficult bugs; c) when using low-quality patches, participants&#039; debugging correctness drops to an even lower point than that of the control group; d) debugging time is significantly affected not by debugging aids, but by participant type and the specific bug to fix. These results highlight that the benefits of using generated patches as debugging aids are contingent upon the quality of the patches. Our qualitative analysis of participants&#039; feedback further sheds light on how generated patches can be improved and better utilized as debugging aids.",

            "Abstract": "This paper establishes the concept of &quot;preprocessor dependences&quot; as a foundation for building automated refactoring tools that transform source code containing lexical macros and conditional compilation directives, such as those provided by the C preprocessor. We define a preprocessor dependence graph (PPDG) that models the relationships among macro definitions, macro invocations, and conditional compilation directives in a file--the relationships that must be maintained for the semantics of the C preprocessor to be preserved. For many refactorings, a tool can construct a PPDG from the code before and after it is transformed, then perform a linear-time comparison of the two graphs to determine whether the refactoring will operate correctly in the presence of macros and conditional compilation directives. The proposed technique was implemented in OpenRefactory/C and tested by applying refactorings to GNU Coreutils version 8.21. Empirical results indicate that the technique is effective; it successfully handled refactoring scenarios in which Eclipse CDT, Visual Assist X, and XRefactory all refactored code incorrectly.",

In this paper, we propose a new technique that can detect both refactoring opportunities and historical refactorings in large code bases. The key of our technique is the design of vector abstraction and concretization operations that can encode code changes induced by certain refactorings as characteristic vectors. Thus, the problem of identifying refactorings can be reduced to the problem of identifying matching vectors, which can be solved efficiently. We have implemented our technique for Java. The prototype is applied to 200 bundle projects from the Eclipse ecosystem containing 4.5 million lines of code, and reports in total more than 32K instances of 17 types of refactoring opportunities, taking 25 minutes on average for each type. The prototype is also applied to 14 versions of 3 smaller programs (JMeter, Ant, XML-Security), and detects (1) more than 2.8K refactoring opportunities within individual versions with a precision of about 87%, and (2) more than 190 historical refactorings across consecutive versions of the programs with a precision of about 92%.",

            "Abstract": "Over the past years, widely used platforms such as the Java Class Library have been under constant attack through vulnerabilities that involve a combination of two taint-analysis problems: an integrity problem allowing attackers to trigger sensitive operations within the platform, and a confidentiality problem allowing the attacker to retrieve sensitive information or pointers from the results of those operations. While existing static taint analyses are good at solving either of those problems, we show that they scale prohibitively badly when being applied to situations that require the exploitation of both an integrity and confidentiality problem in combination. The main problem is the huge attack surface of libraries such as the Java Class Library, which exposes thousands of methods potentially controllable by an attacker.  In this work we thus present FlowTwist, a novel taint-analysis approach that works inside-out, i.e., tracks data flows from potentially vulnerable calls to the outer level of the API which the attacker might control. This inside-out analysis requires a careful, context-sensitive coordination of both a backward and a forward taint analysis. In this work, we expose a design of the analysis approach based on the IFDS algorithm, and explain several extensions to IFDS that enable not only this coordination but also a helpful reporting of error situations to security analysts.  Experiments with the Java Class Library show that, while a simple forward taint-analysis approach does not scale even with much machine power, FlowTwist&#039;s algorithm is able to fully analyze the library within 10 minutes.",

Observation-Based Slicing (ORBS) is a language-independent slicing technique capable of slicing multi-language systems, including systems which contain (third party) binary components. A potential slice obtained through repeated statement deletion is validated by observing the behaviour of the program: if the slice and original program behave the same under the slicing criterion, the deletion is accepted. The resulting slice is similar to a dynamic slice. We evaluate five variants of ORBS on ten programs of different sizes and languages showing that it is less expensive than similar existing techniques. We also evaluate it on bash and four other systems to demonstrate feasible large-scale operation in which a parallelised ORBS needs up to 82% less time when using four threads. The results show that an ORBS slicer is simple to construct, effective at slicing, and able to handle systems written in multiple languages without specialist analysis tools.",

            "Abstract": "JavaScript is used everywhere from the browser to the server, including desktops and mobile devices. However, the current state of the art in JavaScript static analysis lags far behind that of other languages such as C and Java. Our goal is to help remedy this lack. We describe JSAI, a formally specified, robust abstract interpreter for JavaScript. JSAI uses novel abstract domains to compute a reduced product of type inference, pointer analysis, control-flow analysis, string analysis, and integer and boolean constant propagation. Part of JSAI&#039;s novelty is user-configurable analysis sensitivity, i.e., context-, path-, and heap-sensitivity. JSAI is designed to be provably sound with respect to a specific concrete semantics for JavaScript, which has been extensively tested against a commercial JavaScript implementation. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of JSAI&#039;s performance and precision using an extensive benchmark suite, including real-world JavaScript applications, machine generated JavaScript code via Emscripten, and browser addons. We use JSAI&#039;s configurability to evaluate a large number of analysis sensitivities (some well-known, some novel) and observe some surprising results that go against common wisdom. These results highlight the usefulness of a configurable analysis platform such as JSAI.",

            "Abstract": "We present a new graph representation of programs with specified target variables. These programs are intended to be processed by third-party applications querying target variables such as testers and verifiers. The representation embodies two concepts. First, it is path-sensitive in the sense that multiple nodes representing one program point may exist so that infeasible paths can be excluded. Second, and more importantly, it is sliced with respect to the target variables. This key step is founded on a novel idea introduced in this paper, called ``Tree Slicing&#039;&#039;, and on the fact that slicing is more effective when there is path sensitivity. Compared to the traditional Control Flow Graph (CFG), the new graph may be bigger (due to path-sensitivity) or smaller (due to slicing). We show that it is not much bigger in practice, if at all. The main result however concerns its quality: third-party testers and verifiers perform substantially better on the new graph compared to the original CFG.",

Project members evaluate these contributions and often engage in extended discussions to decide whether to integrate changes. These discussions have important implications for project management regarding new contributors and evolution of project requirements and direction. We present a study of how developers in open work environments evaluate and discuss pull requests, a primary method of contribution in GitHub, analyzing a sample of extended discussions around pull requests and interviews with GitHub developers. We found that developers raised issues around contributions over both the appropriateness of the problem that the submitter attempted to solve and the correctness of the implemented solution. Both core project members and third-party stakeholders discussed and sometimes implemented alternative solutions to address these issues. Different stakeholders also influenced the outcome of the evaluation by eliciting support from different communities such as dependent projects or even companies. We also found that evaluation outcomes may be more complex than simply acceptance or rejection. In some cases, although a submitter&#039;s contribution was rejected, the core team fulfilled the submitter&#039;s technical goals by implementing an alternative solution. We found that the level of a submitter&#039;s prior interaction on a project changed how politely developers discussed the contribution and the nature of proposed alternative solutions.",

In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (729 projects, 80 Million SLOC, 29,000 authors, 1.5 million commits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression modeling with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of language features such as static v.s. dynamic typing, strong v.s. weak typing on software quality. By triangulating findings from different methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language design does have a significant, but modest effect on software quality. Most notably, it does appear that strong typing is modestly better than weak typing, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that functional languages are somewhat better than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language design are overwhelmingly dominated by the process factors such as project size, team size, and commit size. However, we hasten to caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possibly be due to other, intangible process factors, e.g., the preference of certain personality types for functional, static and strongly typed languages.",

Formal specifications for the APIs enable many software engineering tasks as well as help developers correctly use them. In this work, we mine large-scale repositories of existing open-source software to derive potential preconditions for API methods. Our key idea is that APIs’ preconditions would appear frequently in an ultra-large code corpus with a large number of API usages, while project-specific conditions will occur less frequently. First, we find all client methods invoking APIs. We then compute a control dependence relation from each call site and mine the potential conditions used to reach those call sites. We use these guard conditions as a starting point to automatically infer the preconditions for each API. We analyzed almost 120 million lines of code from SourceForge and Apache projects to infer preconditions for the standard Java Development Kit (JDK) library. The results show that our technique can achieve high accuracy with recall from 75–80% and precision from 82–84%. We also found 5 preconditions missing from human written specifications. They were all confirmed by a specification expert. In a user study, participants found 82% of the mined preconditions as a good starting point for writing specifications. Using our mining result, we also built a benchmark of more than 4,000 precondition-related bugs.",

            "Abstract": "Software library documentation often describes individual methods&#039; APIs, but not the intended protocols and method interactions. This can lead to library misuse, and restrict runtime detection of protocol violations and automated verification of software that uses the library. Specification mining, if accurate, can help mitigate these issues, which has led to significant research into new model-inference techniques that produce FSM-based models from program invariants and execution traces. However, there is currently a lack of empirical studies that, in a principled way, measure the impact of the inference strategies on model quality. To this end, we identify four such strategies and systematically study the quality of the models they produce for nine off-the-shelf libraries. We find that (1) using invariants to infer an initial model significantly improves model quality, increasing precision by 4% and recall by 41%, on average; (2) effective invariant filtering is crucial for quality and scalability of strategies that use invariants; and (3) using traces in combination with invariants greatly improves robustness to input noise. We present our empirical evaluation, implement new and extend existing model-inference techniques, and make public our implementations, ground-truth models, and experimental data. Our work can lead to higher-quality model inference, and directly improve the techniques and tools that rely on model inference.",

Abstraction techniques have successfully alleviated state explosion in single-system models. However, they need to be adapted to SPLs, to take into account the set of variants that produce a counterexample. In this paper, we apply CEGAR (Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement) and we design new forms of abstraction specifically for SPLs. We carry out experiments to evaluate the efficiency of our new abstractions. The results show that our abstractions, combined with an appropriate refinement strategy, hold the potential to achieve large reductions in verification time, although they sometimes perform worse. We discuss in which cases a given abstraction should be used.",

            "Abstract": "The application of software-verification technology towards building realistic bug-finding tools requires working through several precision-scalability tradeoffs. For instance, a critical aspect while dealing with C programs is to formally define the treatment of pointers and the heap. A machine-level modeling is often intractable, whereas one that leverages high-level information (such as types) can be inaccurate. Another tradeoff is modeling integer arithmetic. Ideally, all arithmetic should be performed over bitvector representations whereas the current practice in most tools is to use mathematical integers for scalability. A third tradeoff, in the context of bounded program exploration, is to choose a bound that ensures high coverage without overwhelming the analysis. This paper works through these three tradeoffs when we applied Corral, an SMT-based verifier, inside Microsoft&#039;s Static Driver Verifier (SDV). Our decisions were guided by experimentation on a large set of drivers; the total verification time exceeded well over a month. We justify that each of our decisions were crucial in getting value out of Corral and led to Corral being accepted as the engine that powers SDV in the Windows 8.1 release, replacing the SLAM engine that had been used inside SDV for the past decade.",

In this paper, we show that it is practical to verify dynamic properties of infinite state models expressed in a subset of CTL directly using an SMT solver without iteration, abstraction, or human intervention. We call this subset CTL-Live and it consists of the operators of CTL expressible using the least fixed point operator of the mu-calculus, which are commonly considered liveness properties (e.g., AF, AU). We show that using this method the verification of an infinite state model can sometimes complete more quickly than verifying a finite version of the model. We also examine modelling techniques to represent abstract models in first-order logic that facilitate this form of model checking.",

            "Abstract": "Policy weaving is a program-transformation technique that rewrites a program so that it is guaranteed to be safe with respect to a stateful security policy. It utilizes (i) static analysis to identify points in the program at which policy violations might occur, and (ii) runtime checks inserted at such points to monitor policy state and prevent violations from occurring. The promise of policy weaving stems from the possibility of blending the best aspects of static and dynamic analysis components. Therefore, a successful instantiation of policy weaving requires a careful balance and coordination between the two. In this paper, we examine the strategy of using a combination of transactional introspection and statement indirection to implement runtime enforcement in a policy-weaving system. Transactional introspection allows the state resulting from the execution of a statement to be examined and, if the policy would be violated, suppressed. Statement indirection serves as a light-weight runtime analysis that can recognize and instrument dynamically generated code that is not available to the static analysis. These techniques can be implemented via static rewriting so that all possible program executions are protected against policy violations. We describe our implementation of transactional introspection and statement indirection for policy weaving, and report experimental results that show the viability of the approach in the context of real-world JavaScript programs executing in a browser.",

            "Abstract": "In continuous integration development environments, software engineers frequently integrate new or changed code with the mainline codebase. This can reduce the amount of code rework that is needed as systems evolve and speed up development time. While continuous integration processes traditionally require that extensive testing be performed following the actual submission of code to the codebase, it is also important to ensure that enough testing is performed prior to code submission to avoid breaking builds and delaying the fast feedback that makes continuous integration desirable. In this work, we present algorithms that make continuous integration processes more cost-effective. In an initial pre-submit phase of testing, developers specify modules to be tested, and we use regression test selection techniques to select a subset of the test suites for those modules that render that phase more cost-effective. In a subsequent post-submit phase of testing, where dependent modules as well as changed modules are tested, we use test case prioritization techniques to ensure that failures are reported more quickly. In both cases, the techniques we utilize are novel, involving algorithms that are relatively inexpensive and do not rely on code coverage information -- two requirements for conducting testing cost-effectively in this context. To evaluate our approach, we conducted an empirical study on a large data set from Google that we make publicly available. The results of our study show that our selection and prioritization techniques can each lead to cost-effectiveness improvements in the continuous integration process.",

            "Abstract": "Regression testing is an important activity but can get expensive for large test suites. Test-suite reduction speeds up regression testing by identifying and removing redundant tests based on a given set of requirements. Traditional research on test-suite reduction is rather diverse but most commonly shares three properties: (1) requirements are defined by a coverage criterion such as statement coverage; (2) the reduced test suite has to satisfy all the requirements as the original test suite; and (3) the quality of the reduced test suites is measured on the software version on which the reduction is performed. These properties make it hard for test engineers to decide how to use reduced test suites. We address all three properties of traditional test-suite reduction: (1) we evaluate test-suite reduction with requirements defined by killed mutants; (2) we evaluate inadequate reduction that does not require reduced test suites to satisfy all the requirements; and (3) we propose evolution-aware metrics that evaluate the quality of the reduced test suites across multiple software versions. Our evaluations allow a more thorough exploration of trade-offs in test-suite reduction, and our evolution-aware metrics show how the quality of reduced test suites can change after the version where the reduction is performed. We compare the trade-offs among various reductions on 18 projects with a total of 261,235 tests over 3,590 commits and a cumulative history spanning 35 years of development. Our results help test engineers make a more informed decision about balancing size, coverage, and fault-detection loss of reduced test suites.",

Using a three-stage manual and automated process, we analyzed 267,046 code review requests from 10 open source projects and identified 413 Vulnerable Code Changes (VCC). Some key results include: (1) code review can identify common types of vulnerabilities; (2) while more experienced contributors authored the majority of the VCCs, the less experienced contributors&#039; changes were 1.8 to 24 times more likely to be vulnerable; (3) the likelihood of a vulnerability increases with the number of lines changed, and (4) modified files are more likely to contain vulnerabilities than new files. Knowing which code changes are more prone to contain vulnerabilities may allow a security expert to concentrate on a smaller subset of submitted code changes. Moreover, we recommend that projects should: (a) create or adapt secure coding guidelines, (b) create a dedicated security review team, (c) ensure detailed comments during review to help knowledge dissemination, and (d) encourage developers to make small, incremental changes rather than large changes.",

However, we show in this paper that this natural-language-based model fails to exploit a special property of source code: localness. We find that human-written programs are localized: they have useful local regularities that can be captured and exploited. We introduce a novel cache language model that consists of both an n-gram and an added “cache&quot; component to exploit localness. We show empirically that the additional cache component greatly improves the n-gram approach by capturing the localness of software, as measured by both cross-entropy and suggestion accuracy. Our model’s suggestion accuracy is actually comparable to a state-of-the-art, semantically augmented language model; but it is simpler and easier to implement. Our cache language model requires nothing beyond lexicalization, and thus is applicable to all programming languages.",

            "Abstract": "Every programmer has a characteristic style, ranging from preferences about identifier naming to preferences about object relationships and design patterns. Coding conventions define a consistent syntactic style, fostering readability and hence maintainability. When collaborating, programmers strive to obey a project’s coding conventions. However, one third of reviews of changes contain feedback about coding conventions, indicating that programmers do not always follow them and that project members care deeply about adherence. Unfortunately, programmers are often unaware of coding conventions because inferring them requires a global view, one that aggregates the many local decisions programmers make and identifies emergent consensus on style. We present NATURALIZE, a framework that learns the style of a codebase, and suggests revisions to improve stylistic consistency. NATURALIZE builds on recent work in applying statistical natural language processing to source code. We apply NATURALIZE to suggest natural identifier names and formatting conventions. We present four tools focused on ensuring natural code during development and release management, including code review. NATURALIZE achieves 94 % accuracy in its top suggestions for identifier names. We used NATURALIZE to generate 18 patches for 5 open source projects: 14 were accepted.",

A wide variety of research has been conducted on source code, and many studies have leveraged structural, vocabulary, and method signature similarities to measure the functional sameness of source code. In this research, we conducted an empirical study to ascertain how we should use three similarities to measure functional sameness. We used two large datasets and measured the three similarities between all the method pairs in the datasets, each of which included approximately 15 million Java method pairs. The relationships between the three similarities were analyzed to determine how we should use each to detect functionally similar code. The results of our study revealed the following. (1) Method names are not always useful for detecting functionally similar code. Only if there are a small number of methods having a given name, the methods are likely to include functionally similar code. (2) Existing file-level, method-level, and block-level clone detection techniques often miss functionally similar code generated by copy-and-paste operations between different projects. (3) In the cases we use structural similarity for detecting functionally similar code, we obtained many false positives. However, we can avoid detecting most false positives by using a vocabulary similarity in addition to a structural one. (4) Using a vocabulary similarity to detect functionally similar code is not suitable for method pairs in the same file because such method pairs use many of the same program elements such as private methods or private fields.",

This insight has been dubbed the plastic surgery hypothesis; successful, well-known automatic repair tools such as GenProg rest on this hypothesis, but it has never been validated. We formalize and validate the plastic surgery hypothesis and empirically measure the extent to which raw material for changes actually already exists in projects. In this paper, we mount a large-scale study of several large Java projects, and examine a history of 15,723 commits to determine the extent to which these commits are graftable, i.e., can be reconstituted from existing code, and find an encouraging degree of graftability, surprisingly independent of commit size and type of commit. For example, we find that changes are 43% graftable from the exact version of the software being changed. With a view to investigating the difficulty of finding these grafts, we study the abundance of such grafts in three possible sources: the immediately previous version, prior history, and other projects. We also examine the contiguity or chunking of these grafts, and the degree to which grafts can be found in the same file. Our results are quite promising and suggest an optimistic future for automatic program patching methods that search for raw material in already extant code in the project being patched.",

            "Abstract": "Writing efficient synchronization for multithreaded programs is notoriously hard. The resulting code often contains subtle concurrency bugs. Even worse, many bug fixes introduce new bugs. A classic example, seen widely in practice, is deadlocks resulting from fixing of an atomicity violation. These complexities have motivated the development of automated fixing techniques. Current techniques generate fixes that are typically conservative, giving up on available parallelism. Moreover, some of the techniques cannot guarantee the correctness of a fix, and may introduce deadlocks similarly to manual fix, whereas techniques that ensure correctness do so at the expense of even greater performance loss. We present Grail, a novel fixing algorithm that departs from previous techniques by simultaneously providing both correctness and optimality guarantees. Grail synthesizes bug-free yet optimal lock-based synchronization. To achieve this, Grail builds an analysis model of the buggy code that is both contextual, distinguishing different aliasing contexts to ensure efficiency, and global, accounting for the entire synchronization behavior of the involved threads to ensure correctness. Evaluation of Grail on 12 bugs from popular codebases confirms its practical advantages, especially compared with existing techniques: Grail patches are, in general, &gt;=40% more efficient than the patches produced by other techniques, and incur only 2% overhead.",

            "Abstract": "Concurrency bugs are notoriously difficult to eradicate during software testing because of their non-deterministic nature. Moreover, fixing concurrency bugs is time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, tolerating concurrency bugs during production runs is an attractive complementary approach to bug detection and testing. Unfortunately, existing bug-tolerating tools are usually either 1) constrained in types of bugs they can handle or 2) requiring roll-back mechanism, which can hitherto not be fully achieved efficiently without hardware supports. This paper presents a novel program invariant, called Anticipating Invariant (AI), which can help anticipate bugs before any irreversible changes are made. Benefiting from this ability of anticipating bugs beforehand, our software-only system is able to forestall the failures with a simple thread stalling technique, which does not rely on execution roll-back and hence has good performance Experiments with 35 real-world concurrency bugs demonstrate that AI is capable of detecting and tolerating most types of concurrency bugs, including both atomicity and order violations. Two new bugs have been detected and confirmed by the corresponding developers. Performance evaluation with 6 representative parallel programs shows that AI incurs negligible overhead (&lt;1%) for many nontrivial desktop and server applications.",

            "Abstract": "Running compute-intensive or blocking I/O operations in the UI event thread of smartphone apps can severely degrade responsiveness. Despite the fact that Android supports writing concurrent code via AsyncTask, we know little about how developers use AsyncTask to improve responsiveness. To understand how AsyncTask is used/underused/misused in practice, we rst conduct a formative study using a corpus of top 104 most popular open-source Android apps comprising 1.34M SLOC. Our study shows that even though half of the apps use AsyncTask, there are hundreds of places where they missed opportunities to encapsulate long-running operations in AsyncTask. Second, 46% of the usages are manually refactored. However, the refactored code contains concurrency bugs (such as data races) and performance bugs (concurrent code still executes sequentially). Inspired by these ndings, we designed, developed, and evaluated Asynchronizer, an automated refactoring tool that enables developers to extract long-running operations into AsyncTask. Asynchronizer uses a points-to static analysis to determine the safety of the transformation. Our empirical evaluation shows that Asynchronizer is (i) highly applicable, (ii) accurate, (iii) safer than manual refactoring (iv) it saves development eort, (v) its results have been accepted by the open-source developers. This shows that Asynchronizer is useful.",

            "Abstract": "Software components are usually redundant, since their interface offers different operations that are equivalent in their functional behavior. Several reliability techniques exploit this redundancy to either detect or tolerate faults in software. Metamorphic testing, for instance, executes pairs of sequences of operations that are expected to produce equivalent results, and identifies faults in case of mismatching outcomes. Some popular fault tolerance and self-healing techniques execute redundant operations in an attempt to avoid failures at runtime. The common assumption of these techniques, though, is that such redundancy is known a priori. This means that the set of operations that are supposed to be equivalent in a given component should be available in the specifications. Unfortunately, inferring this information manually can be expensive and error prone. This paper proposes a search-based technique to synthesize sequences of method invocations that are equivalent to a target method within a finite set of execution scenarios. The experimental results obtained on 47 methods from 7 classes show that the proposed approach correctly identifies equivalent method sequences in the majority of the cases where redundancy was known to exist, with very few false positives.",

In prior work we developed algorithms and conducted a post-hoc analysis demonstrating the possibility of adapting to software failures by judiciously changing configurations. In this paper we present the REFRACT framework that realizes this idea in practice by building on the self-adaptive Rainbow architecture. REFRACT extends Rainbow with new components and algorithms targeting failure avoidance. We use REFRACT in a case study running four independently executing Firefox clients with 36 passing test cases and 7 seeded faults. The study show that workarounds for all but one of the seeded faults are found and the one that is not found never fails -- it is guarded from failing by a related workaround. Moreover, REFRACT finds workarounds for eight configuration-related unseeded failures from tests that were expected to pass (and did under the default configuration). Finally, the data show that when a failure and its workaround are found, configuration guards prevent the failure from appearing again. In a simulation lasting 24 hours we see over 150 guard activations and no failures with workarounds remaining beyond 16 hours.",

In the case of software plagiarism, emerging obfuscation techniques have made automated detection increasingly difficult. In this paper, we propose a binary-oriented, obfuscation-resilient method based on a new concept, longest common subsequence of semantically equivalent basic blocks, which combines rigorous program semantics with longest common subsequence based fuzzy matching. We model the semantics of a basic block by a set of symbolic formulas representing the input-output relations of the block. This way, the semantics equivalence (and similarity) of two blocks can be checked by a theorem prover. We then model the semantics similarity of two paths using the longest common subsequence with basic blocks as elements. This novel combination has resulted in strong resiliency to code obfuscation. We have developed a prototype and our experimental results show that our method is effective and practical when applied to real-world software.",

Shifting focus can have impact on the software quality and productivity, and is thus an important topic of investigation. In this paper, we study focus shifting patterns (FSPs) of developers by comparing trace data from a dozen open source software (OSS) projects of their longitudinal commit activities and file dependencies from the projects call graphs. Using information theoretic measures of network structure, we find that fairly complex focus-shifting patterns emerge, and FSPs in the same project are more similar to each other. We show that developers tend to shift focus along with, rather than away from, software dependency links described by the call graphs. This tendency becomes weaker as either the interval between successive commits, or the organizational distance between committed files (i.e. directory distance), gets larger. Interestingly, this tendency appears stronger with more productive developers. We hope our study will initiate interest in further understanding of FSPs, which can ultimately help to (1) improve current recommender systems to predict the next focus of developers, and (2) provide insight into better call graph design, so as to facilitate developers&#039; work.",

            "Abstract": "One of the biggest challenges in concolic testing, an automatic test generation technique, is its huge search space. Concolic testing generates next inputs by selecting branches from previous execution paths. However, a large number of candidate branches makes a simple exhaustive search infeasible, which often leads to poor test coverage. Several search strategies have been proposed to explore high-priority branches only. Each strategy applies different criteria to the branch selection process but most do not consider context, how we got to the branch, in the selection process. In this paper, we introduce a context-guided search (CGS) strategy. CGS looks at preceding branches in execution paths and selects a branch in a new context for the next input. We evaluate CGS with two publicly available concolic testing tools, CREST and CarFast, on six C subjects and six Java subjects. The experimental results show that CGS achieves the highest coverage of all twelve subjects and reaches a target coverage with a much smaller number of iterations on most subjects than other strategies.",

            "Abstract": "Test input generators using symbolic and concolic execution must solve path conditions to systematically explore a program and generate high coverage tests. However, path conditions may contain complicated arithmetic constraints that are infeasible to solve: a solver may be unavailable, solving may be computationally intractable, or the constraints may be undecidable. Existing test generators either simplify such constraints with concrete values to make them decidable, or rely on strong but incomplete constraint solvers. Unfortunately, simplification yields coarse approximations whose solutions rarely satisfy the original constraint. Moreover, constraint solvers cannot handle calls to native library methods. We show how a simple combination of linear constraint solving and heuristic search can overcome these limitations. We call this technique Concolic Walk. On a corpus of 11 programs, an instance of our Concolic Walk algorithm using tabu search generates tests with two- to three-times higher coverage than simplification-based tools while being up to five-times as efficient. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the coverage of two state-of-the-art test generators by 21% and 32%. Other concolic and symbolic testing tools could integrate our algorithm to solve complex path conditions without having to sacrifice any of their own capabilities, leading to higher overall coverage.",

To address this challenge, we propose a statistical symbolic execution technique that performs Monte Carlo sampling of the symbolic program paths and uses the obtained information for Bayesian estimation and hypothesis testing with respect to the probability of reaching the target events. To speed up the convergence of the statistical analysis, we propose Informed Sampling, an iterative symbolic execution that first explores the paths that have high statistical significance, prunes them from the state space and guides the execution towards less likely paths. The technique combines Bayesian estimation with a partial exact analysis for the pruned paths leading to provably improved convergence of the statistical analysis. We have implemented statistical symbolic execution with informed sampling in the Symbolic PathFinder tool. We show experimentally that the informed sampling obtains more precise results and converges faster than a purely statistical analysis and may also be more efficient than an exact symbolic analysis. When the latter does not terminate symbolic execution with informed sampling can give meaningful results under the same time and memory limits.",

The tool contains a symbolic execution engine for JavaScript, and an automatic event explorer for Web pages. Without any user intervention, SymJS can automatically discover and explore Web events, symbolically execute the associated JavaScript code, refine the execution based on dynamic feedbacks, and produce test cases with high coverage. The symbolic engine contains a symbolic virtual machine, a string-numeric solver, and a symbolic executable DOM model. SymJS&#039;s innovations include a novel symbolic virtual machine for JavaScript Web, symbolic+dynamic feedback directed event space exploration, and dynamic taint analysis for enhancing event sequence construction. We illustrate the effectiveness of SymJS on standard JavaScript benchmarks and various real-life Web applications. On average SymJS achieves over 90% line coverage for the benchmark programs, significantly outperforming existing methods.",

Many usage contexts for code examples require them to be distilled to their essence: e.g., when serving as cues to longer documents, or for reminding developers of a previously known idiom. We conducted a study to discover how code can be summarized and why. As part of the study, we collected 156 pairs of code examples and their summaries from 16 participants, along with over 26 hours of think-aloud verbalizations detailing the decisions of the participants during their summarization activities. Based on a qualitative analysis of this data we elicited a list of practices followed by the participants to summarize code examples and propose empirically-supported hypotheses justifying the use of specific practices. One main finding was that none of the participants exclusively extracted code verbatim for the summaries, motivating abstractive summarization. The results provide a grounded basis for the development of code example summarization and presentation technology.",

We take the view that a code idiom is a syntactic fragment that recurs across projects and has a single semantic purpose. Idioms may have metavariables, such as the body of a for loop. Modern IDEs commonly provide facilities for manually defining idioms and inserting them on demand, but this does not help programmers to write idiomatic code in languages or using libraries with which they are unfamiliar. We present Haggis, a system for mining code idioms that builds on recent advanced techniques from statistical natural language processing, namely, nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic tree substitution grammars. We apply Haggis to several of the most popular open source projects from GitHub. We present a wide range of evidence that the resulting idioms are semantically meaningful, demonstrating that they do indeed recur across software projects and that they occur more frequently in illustrative code examples collected from a Q&amp;A site. Manual examination of the most common idioms indicate that they describe important program concepts, including object creation, exception handling, and resource management.",

            "Abstract": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing the look and formatting of HTML documents. CSS has been widely adopted in web and mobile development practice, since it enables a clean separation of content from presentation. The language exhibits complex features, such as inheritance, cascading and specificity, which make CSS code hard to maintain. Therefore, it is important to find ways to improve the maintainability of CSS code. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to remove duplication in CSS code. More specifically, we have developed a technique that detects three types of CSS declaration duplication and recommends refactoring opportunities to eliminate those duplications. Our approach uses preconditions that ensure the application of a refactoring will preserve the original document styling. We evaluate our technique on 38 real-world web systems and 91 CSS files, in total. Our findings show that duplication in CSS code is widely prevalent. Additionally, there is a significant number of presentation-preserving refactoring opportunities that can reduce the size of the CSS files and increase the maintainability of the code.",

            "Abstract": "The evolution of Web 2.0 technologies makes web applications prevalent in various platforms including mobile devices and smart TVs. While one of the driving technologies of web applications is JavaScript, the extremely dynamic features of JavaScript make it very difficult to define and detect errors in JavaScript applications. The problem becomes more important and complicated for JavaScript web applications which may lead to severe security vulnerabilities. To help developers write safe JavaScript web applications using vendor-specific Web APIs, vendors specify their APIs often in Web IDL, which enables both API writers and users to communicate better by understanding the expected behaviors of the Web APIs. In this paper, we present SAFEWAPI, a tool to analyze Web APIs and JavaScript web applications that use the Web APIs and to detect possible misuses of Web APIs by the web applications. Even though the JavaScript language semantics allows to call a function defined with some parameters without any arguments, platform developers may require application writers to provide the exact number of arguments. Because the library functions in Web APIs expose their intended semantics clearly to web application developers unlike pure JavaScript functions, we can detect wrong uses of Web APIs precisely. For representative misuses of Web APIs defined by software quality assurance engineers, our SAFEWAPI detects such misuses in real-world JavaScript web applications.",

In dynamic web applications, such tool support is currently limited to either the server-side code or to hand-written or generated client-side code. Our goal is to build a call graph for providing editor services on client-side code while it is still embedded as string literals within server-side code. First, we symbolically execute the server-side code to identify all possible client-side code variations. Subsequently, we parse the generated client-side code with all its variations into a VarDOM that compactly represents all DOM variations for further analysis. Based on the VarDOM, we build conditional call graphs for embedded HTML, CSS, and JS. Our empirical evaluation on real-world web applications show that our analysis achieves 100% precision in identifying call-graph edges. 62% of the edges cross PHP strings, and 17% of them cross files - in both situations, navigation without tool support is tedious and error prone.",

In this paper, we investigate the use of sketches and diagrams in software engineering practice. To this end, we used both quantitative and qualitative methods. We present the results of an exploratory study in three companies and an online survey with 394 participants. Our participants included software developers, software architects, project managers, consultants, as well as researchers. They worked in different countries and on projects from a wide range of application areas. Most questions in the survey were related to the last sketch or diagram that the participants had created. Contrary to our expectations and previous work, the majority of sketches and diagrams contained at least some UML elements. However, most of them were informal. The most common purposes for creating sketches and diagrams were designing, explaining, and understanding, but analyzing requirements was also named often. More than half of the sketches and diagrams were created on analog media like paper or whiteboards and have been revised after creation. Most of them were used for more than a week and were archived. We found that the majority of participants related their sketches to methods, classes, or packages, but not to source code artifacts with a lower level of abstraction.",

Even within a single organization, this paradigm can be of high value for large-scale decentralized software projects that involve various internal, yet self-contained organizational units. However, this intra-organizational decentralization causes architecture challenges that must be understood to reason about suitable architectural measures. We present an in-depth case study on collaboration and architecture challenges in two of these large-scale software projects at Siemens. We performed a total of 46 hours of semi-structured interviews with 17 leading software architects from all involved organizational units. Our major findings are: (1) three collaboration models on a continuum that ranges from high to low coupling, (2) a classification of architecture challenges, together with (3) a qualitative and quantitative exposure of the identified recurring issues along each collaboration model. Our study results provide valuable insights for both industry and academia: Practitioners that find themselves in one of the collaboration models can use empirical evidence on challenges to make informed decisions about counteractive measures. Researchers can focus their attention on challenges faced by practitioners to make software engineering more effective.",

The feature-interaction problem states that the number of potential interactions is exponential in the number of features in a system. Resolution strategies offer general strategies that resolve entire classes of interactions, thereby reducing the work of the developer who is charged with the task of resolving interactions. In this paper, we focus on resolving interactions due to conflict. We present an approach, language, and implementation based on resolution modules in which the developer can specify an appropriate resolution for each variable under conflict. We performed a case study involving 24 automotive features, and found that the number of resolutions to be specified was much smaller than the number of possible feature interactions (6 resolutions for 24 features), that what constitutes an appropriate resolution strategy is different for different variables, and that the subset of situation calculus we used was sufficient to construct nontrivial resolution strategies for six distinct output variables.",

            "Abstract": "Starting from the first investigations with strictly functional languages, reactive programming has been proposed as THE programming paradigm for reactive applications. The advantages of designs based on this style over designs based on the Observer design pattern have been studied for a long time. Over the years, researchers have enriched reactive languages with more powerful abstractions, embedded these abstractions into mainstream languages – including object-oriented languages – and applied reactive programming to several domains, like GUIs, animations, Web applications, robotics, and sensor networks. However, an important assumption behind this line of research – that, beside other advantages, reactive programming makes a wide class of otherwise cumbersome applications more comprehensible – has never been evaluated. In this paper, we present the design and the results of the first empirical study that evaluates the effect of reactive programming on comprehensibility compared to the traditional object-oriented style with the Observer design pattern. Results confirm the conjecture that comprehensibility is enhanced by reactive programming. In the experiment, the reactive programming group significantly outperforms the other group.",

            "Abstract": "Over the recent years, the popularity of smartphones has increased dramatically. This has lead to a widespread availability of smartphone applications. Since smartphones operate on a limited amount of battery power, it is important to develop tools and techniques that aid in energy-efficient application development. Energy inefficiencies in smartphone applications can broadly be categorized into energy hotspots and energy bugs. An energy hotspot can be described as a scenario where executing an application causes the smartphone to consume abnormally high amount of battery power, even though the utilization of its hardware resources is low. In contrast, an energy bug can be described as a scenario where a malfunctioning application prevents the smartphone from becoming idle, even after it has completed execution and there is no user activity. In this paper, we present an automated test generation framework that detects energy hotspots/bugs in Android applications. Our framework systematically generates test inputs that are likely to capture energy hotspots/bugs. Each test input captures a sequence of user interactions (e.g. touches or taps on the smartphone screen) that leads to an energy hotspot/bug in the application. Evaluation with 30 freely-available Android applications from Google Play/F-Droid shows the efficacy of our framework in finding hotspots/bugs. Manual validation of the experimental results shows that our framework reports reasonably low number of false positives. Finally, we show the usage of the generated results by improving the energy-efficiency of some Android applications.",

Prior research has primarily focused on either unit or GUI testing of Android apps, but not their end-to-end system testing in a systematic manner. We present EvoDroid, an evolutionary approach for system testing of Android apps. EvoDroid overcomes a key shortcoming of using evolutionary techniques for system testing, i.e., the inability to pass on genetic makeup of good individuals in the search. To that end, EvoDroid combines two novel techniques: (1) an Android-specific program analysis technique that identifies the segments of the code amenable to be searched independently, and (2) an evolutionary algorithm that given information of such segments performs a step-wise search for test cases reaching deep into the code. Our experiments have corroborated EvoDroid’s ability to achieve significantly higher code coverage than existing Android testing tools.",

            "Abstract": "Star ratings that are given by the users of mobile apps directly impact the revenue of its developers. At the same time, for popular platforms like Android, these apps must run on hundreds of devices increasing the chance for device-specific problems. Device-specific problems could impact the rating assigned to an app, given the varying capabilities of devices (e.g., hardware and software). To fix device-specific problems developers must test their apps on a large number of Android devices, which is costly and inefficient. Therefore, to help developers pick which devices to test their apps on, we propose using the devices that are mentioned in user reviews. We mine the user reviews of 99 free game apps and find that, apps receive user reviews from a large number of devices: between 38 to 132 unique devices. However, most of the reviews (80%) originate from a small subset of devices (on average, 33%). Furthermore, we find that developers of new game apps with no reviews can use the review data of similar game apps to select the devices that they should focus on first. Finally, among the set of devices that generate the most reviews for an app, we find that some devices tend to generate worse ratings than others. Our findings indicate that focusing on the devices with the most reviews (in particular the ones with negative ratings), developers can effectively prioritize their limited Quality Assurance (QA) efforts, since these devices have the greatest impact on ratings.",

            "Abstract": "Writing oracles is challenging. As a result, developers often create oracles that check too little, resulting in tests that are unable to detect failures, or check too much, resulting in tests that are brittle and difficult to maintain. In this paper we present a new technique for automatically analyzing test oracles. The technique is based on dynamic tainting and detects both brittle assertions—assertions that depend on values that are derived from uncontrolled inputs—and unused inputs—inputs provided by the test that are not checked by an assertion. We also presented OraclePolish, an implementation of the technique that can analyze tests that are written in Java and use the JUnit testing framework. Using OraclePolish, we conducted an empirical evaluation of more than 4000 real test cases. The results of the evaluation show that OraclePolish is effective; it detected 164 tests that contain brittle assertions and 1618 tests that have unused inputs. In addition, the results also demonstrate that the costs associated with using the technique are reasonable.",

            "Abstract": "The aim of automated program testing is to gain confidence about a program&#039;s correctness by sampling its input space. The sampling process can be either systematic or random. For every systematic testing technique the sampling is informed by the analysis of some program artefacts, like the specification, the source code (e.g., to achieve coverage), or even faulty versions of the program (e.g., mutation testing). This analysis incurs some cost. In contrast, random testing is unsystematic and does not sustain any analysis cost. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical efficiency of systematic versus random testing. First, we mathematically model the most effective systematic testing technique S_0 in which every sampled test input strictly increases the &quot;degree of confidence&quot; and is subject to the analysis cost c. Note that the efficiency of S_0 depends on c. Specifically, if we increase c, we also increase the time it takes S_0 to establish the same degree of confidence. So, there exists a maximum analysis cost beyond which R is generally more efficient than S_0. Given that we require the confidence that the program works correctly for x% of its input, we prove an upper bound on c of S_0, beyond which R is more efficient on the average. We also show that this bound depends asymptotically only on x. For instance, let R take 10ms time to sample one test input; to establish that the program works correctly for 90% of its input, S_0 must take less than 41ms to sample one test input. Otherwise, R is expected to establish the 90%-degree of confidence earlier. We prove similar bounds on the cost if the software tester is interested in revealing as many errors as possible in a given time span.",

An important assumption of regression testing is that test outcomes are deterministic: an unmodified test is expected to either always pass or always fail for the same code under test. Unfortunately, in practice, some tests often called flaky tests—have non-deterministic outcomes. Such tests undermine the regression testing as they make it difficult to rely on test results. We present the first extensive study of flaky tests. We study in detail a total of 201 commits that likely fix flaky tests in 51 open-source projects. We classify the most common root causes of flaky tests, identify approaches that could manifest flaky behavior, and describe common strategies that developers use to fix flaky tests. We believe that our insights and implications can help guide future research on the important topic of (avoiding) flaky tests.",

            "Abstract": "A good test suite is one that detects real faults. Because the set of faults in a program is usually unknowable, this definition is not useful to practitioners who are creating test suites, nor to researchers who are creating and evaluating tools that generate test suites. In place of real faults, testing research often uses mutants, which are artificial faults -- each one a simple syntactic variation -- that are systematically seeded throughout the program under test. Mutation analysis is appealing because large numbers of mutants can be automatically-generated and used to compensate for low quantities or the absence of known real faults. Unfortunately, there is little experimental evidence to support the use of mutants as a replacement for real faults. This paper investigates whether mutants are indeed a valid substitute for real faults, i.e., whether a test suite’s ability to detect mutants is correlated with its ability to detect real faults that developers have fixed. Unlike prior studies, these investigations also explicitly consider the conflating effects of code coverage on the mutant detection rate. Our experiments used 357 real faults in 5 open-source applications that comprise a total of 321,000 lines of code. Furthermore, our experiments used both developer-written and automatically-generated test suites. The results show a statistically significant correlation between mutant detection and real fault detection, independently of code coverage. The results also give concrete suggestions on how to improve mutation analysis and reveal some inherent limitations.",

            "Abstract": "Modern software development tools such as issue trackers are often complex and multi-purpose tools that provide access to an immense amount of raw information. Unfortunately, developers sometimes feel frustrated when they cannot easily obtain the particular information they need for a given task; furthermore, the constant influx of new data — the vast majority of which is irrelevant to their task at hand — may result in issues being &quot;dropped on the floor&quot;. In this paper, we present a developer-centric approach to issue tracking that aims to reduce information overload and improve developers&#039; situational awareness. Our approach is motivated by a grounded theory study of developer comments, which suggests that customized views of a project&#039;s repositories that are tailored to developer-specific tasks can help developers better track their progress and understand the surrounding technical context. From the qualitative study, we uncovered a model of the kinds of information elements that are essential for developers in completing their daily tasks, and from this model we built a tool organized around customized issue-tracking dashboards. Further quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrated that this dashboard-like approach to issue tracking can reduce the volume of irrelevant emails by over 99% and also improve support for specific issue-tracking tasks.",

            "Abstract": "There is an increasing trend to outsource maintenance of large applications and application portfolios of a business to third parties, specialising in application maintenance, who are incented to deliver the best possible maintenance at the lowest cost. To do so, they need to identify repeat problem areas, which cause more maintenance grief, and seek a unified remedy to avoid the costs spent on fixing these individually. These repeat areas, in a sense, represent major, evolving areas of need, or requirements, for the customer. The information about the repeating problem is typically embedded in the unstructured text of multiple tickets, waiting to be found and addressed. Currently, repeat problems are found by manual analysis; effective solutions depend on the collective experience of the team solving them. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically analyze problem tickets to discover groups of problems being reported in them and provide meaningful, descriptive labels to help interpret these groups. Our approach incorporates a cleansing phase to handle the high level of noise observed in problem tickets and a method to incorporate multiple text clustering techniques and merge their results in a meaningful manner. We provide detailed experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate our approach",

            "Abstract": "When a new bug report is received, developers usually need to reproduce the bug and perform code reviews to find the cause, a process that can be tedious and time consuming. A tool for ranking all the source files of a project with respect to how likely they are to contain the cause of the bug would enable developers to narrow down their search and potentially could lead to a substantial increase in productivity. This paper introduces an adaptive ranking approach that leverages domain knowledge through functional decompositions of source code files into methods, API descriptions of library components used in the code, the bug-fixing history, and the code change history. Given a bug report, the ranking score of each source file is computed as a weighted combination of an array of features encoding domain knowledge, where the weights are trained automatically on previously solved bug reports using a learning-to-rank technique. We evaluated our system on six large scale open source Java projects, using the before-fix version of the project for every bug report. The experimental results show that the newly introduced learning-to-rank approach significantly outperforms two recent state-of-the-art methods in recommending relevant files for bug reports. In particular, our method makes correct recommendations within the top 10 ranked source files for over 70% of the bug reports in the Eclipse Platform and Tomcat projects.",

Different from other types of SE data, sequential SE data preserves unique temporal properties, which cannot be easily analyzed without much programming effort. In order to facilitate the analysis of sequential SE data, we design a sequential pattern query language (SPQL), which specifies the temporal properties based on regular expressions, and is enhanced with variables and statements to store and manipulate matching states. We also propose a query engine to effectively process the SPQL queries. We have applied our approach to analyze two types of SE data, namely bug report history and source code change history. We experiment with 181,213 Eclipse bug reports and 323,989 code revisions of Android. SPQL enables us to explore interesting temporal properties underneath these sequential data with a few lines of query code and low matching overhead. The analysis results can help better under- stand a software process and identify process violations.",

Our recent study revealed that buggy files are usually architecturally connected by architecture issues such as unstable interfaces and modularity violations. We aim to detect and prevent these architecture issues that are the root causes of defects. Our contributions include (1) a new architecture model, Design Rule Space (DRSpace), that can express structural relations, quality, and evolutionary information simultaneously; (2) a method of automatically extracting defect-prone architecture roots by combining static architecture analysis with software revision history data mining. The preliminary application of our approach to dozens of open source and industry projects has demonstrated its significant potential to inform developers about how software defects should be discovered, examined, and handled.",

            "Abstract": "Although software development involves making numerous decisions amongst alternatives, the design and implementation choices made typically become invisible; what a developer sees in the project&#039;s artifacts are the end result of all of the decisions. What if, instead, all of the choices made were tracked and it was easy for a developer to revisit a point where a decision was made and choose another alternative? What if the development environment could detect and suggest alternative choices? What if it was easy and low-cost to try another path? We explore the idea of speculative reprogramming that could support a what-if environment for the programming stages of software development.",

            "Abstract": "Mutation testing is an effective technique for either improving or generating fault-finding test suites. It creates defective or incorrect program artifacts of the program under test and evaluates the ability of test suites to reveal them. Despite being effective, mutation is costly since it requires assessing the test cases with a large number of defective artifacts. Even worse, some of these artifacts are behaviourally ``equivalent&#039;&#039; to the original one and hence, they unnecessarily increase the testing effort. We adopt a variability perspective on mutation analysis. We model a defective artifact as a transition system with a specific feature selected and consider it as a member of a mutant family. The mutant family is encoded as a Featured Transition System, a compact formalism initially dedicated to model-checking of software product lines. We show how to evaluate a test suite against the set of all candidate defects by using mutant families. We can evaluate all the considered defects at the same time and isolate some equivalent mutants. We can also assist the test generation process and efficiently consider higher-order mutants.",

The operational data in software repositories presents the tantalizing possibility to discover such fine-scale behaviors and use them to understand and improve software development. We propose a large-scale evidence-based approach to accomplish this by first creating a mirror of the projects in the open source universe. The next step would involve the inductive generalization from in-depth studies of specific projects from one side and the categorization of micro-practices in the entire universe from the other side.",

As a result, it is neither trusted nor trustworthy. In this vision paper we propose a philosophical change in the traceability landscape which transforms traceability from a heavy-weight process producing untrusted trace links, to a light-weight results-oriented trustworthy solution. Current traceability practices which retard agility are cast away and replaced with a disciplined, just-in-time approach. The novelty of our solution lies in a clear separation of trusted trace links from untrusted ones, the change in perspective from `living-with&#039; inacurate traces toward rigorous and ongoing debridement of stale links from the trusted pool, and the notion of synthesizing available `project exhaust&#039; as evidence to systematically construct or reconstruct purposed, highly-focused trace links.",

            "Abstract": "abstract Software maintenance exhibits many differences regarding how other engineering disciplines carry out maintenance on their artifacts. Such dissimilarity is caused due to the fact that it is easy to get a copy from the original artifact to be used in maintenance, and also because the flat dimension of the software text facilitates access to the components by simply using a text editor. Other engineering disciplines resort to different artifact versions (obtained by dissassembling) where the introduction of modifications (previous comprehension) is easier. After which the artifact is reassembled. In software engineering this approach can be simulated by combining program transformation techniques, search-based software engineering technology and design attributes. %%This easiness (absent in the other engineering sciences) as well as the intangible software nature can lead to the belief %%that a software maintenance model similar to those of the other engineering sciences is unnecessary or unfeasible. %%This paper states the opposite, and as a consequence, an entirely new and more robust software maintenance model emerges. abstract",

However, a description of a feature does not clearly specify the boundary of the feature, while developers tend to locate the feature precisely by excluding marginal modules that are likely outside of the boundary. This paper addresses a question: does a clearer description of a feature enable developers to recognize the same sets of modules as relevant to the feature? Based on the conducted experiment with subjects, we conclude that different descriptions lead to a different set of modules.",

However, they mainly focus on the impacts brought by domain experts or experienced developers on developing and managing open source softwares, whereas how softwares are influenced by the ordinary people e.g. end users is seldom discussed and easily omitted. To fill up the research gaps, we investigate into commercial application improvement paradigm with assistance of user crowd. The approach focuses on end users by proposing a workflow loop to form a healthy cycle between them and applications. Especially, the approach propose a suggestion model to encourage users to participate into application runtime adaptation. So far, a prototype is developed to enable the crowd to raise and modify their advices, and our prior work has proven the effectiveness in which applications consider the users’ advices to adapt themselves.",

            "Abstract": "Crowdsourcing means outsourcing to a large network of people – a crowd. It has emerged as a new option for a global labor market; it is another valuable option in the ´make or buy´ software decision and has been gaining attention in countries where global software engineering plays a significant role, such as Brazil. The adoption of this practice in the Brazilian IT industry is not well known yet. For this reason, this paper presents findings from an empirical study about the topic, in the context of a multi-year study that has the goal of investigating how the Brazilian software labor and industry market is being transformed and disrupted by crowdsourcing. We interviewed professionals from several companies and identified how crowdsourcing is being adopted in Brazil, including possible benefits, main concerns and factors that may avoid some companies to adopt it from three different perspectives: the buyers, the platforms and the crowd. We also share our thoughts about the future of crowdsourcing in the country in the coming years.",

            "Abstract": "Entity resolution is the process of identifying the data records representing the same entity. ER is a highly important problem in software and application domains. For example, detecting duplicate bug reports with ER can greatly save developing efforts. In most cases, humans can perform better than computer algorithms due to complex semantic analysis involved in ER. In light of this, crowdsourcing has been successfully incorporated into ER to improve its accuracy. However, compared with computer methods, crowdsourcing is subject to higher costs. In this work, we propose a method to reduce the number of questions asked to people with clustering and transitivity analysis. Firstly, with appropriate choosing of two similarity thresholds, we use unsupervised machine learning to cluster records into multiple clusters on the basis of certain similarity metrics. In this way, we prune away the record pairs with no need for asking people. Secondly, we design a cluster merging algorithm with efficient selection of crowdsourced questions and leveraging data transitivity to detect the across-cluster records corresponding to the same entity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments with two real-world datasets and the results show our method significantly outperform existing methods in terms of incurred costs and the F1 metric.",

Online service providers in many fields have been using user behavior data to discover user preferences and interests to achieve various purposes. In the field of software engineering however, there has been few studies in mining large amount of user behavior data. Our goal is to design an approach based on user behavior data, to recommend relevant open source projects to developers, which can be helpful in activities like searching for the right open source solutions to quickly build prototypes. In this paper, we explore the possibilities of such a method by conducting a set of experiments on selected data sets from Github.

Github, a remarkable social coding community, attracts a huge number of developers in a short time. Various kinds of social networks are formed based on social activities among developers. Why this new paradigm can achieve such a great success in attracting external developers, and how they are connected in such a massive community, are interesting questions for revealing power of social coding paradigm. In this paper, we firstly compare the growth curves of project and user in GitHub with three traditional open source software communities to explore differences of their growth modes. We find an explosive growth of the users in GitHub and introduce the Diffusion of Innovation theory to illustrate intrinsic sociological basis of this phenomenon. Secondly, we construct follow-networks according to the follow behaviors among developers in GitHub. Finally, we present four typical social behavior patterns by mining follow-networks containing independence-pattern, group-pattern, star-pattern and hub-pattern. This study can provide several instructions of crowd collaboration to newcomers. According to the typical behavior patterns, the community manager could design corresponding assistive tools for developers.",

Traditional human resource management based on the information management system usually adopts SQL queries or keywords search, which cannot capture the im- plicit information, while the manual work is always time- consuming. To ll this gap, this paper presents SmartHR, a resume query and management system based on seman- tic web. Beneting from knowledge base, it can understand users&#039; intentions more intelligently and search for suitable candidates more accurately. In this paper, we propose two key technical diculties which SmartHR meets, including the complexity of knowledge base construction and the time- consuming semantic search, and then give appropriate solu- tions respectively. Four channels are adopted to construct knowledge base, which are well illustrated. Furthermore, a variety of performance optimizations are employed and the eectiveness is evaluated on real datasets of up to million- s of triples and the results show a great improvement. As a representative application in semantic web, our practice in SmartHR provides useful experience and conclusions for developers.",

We introduce a Small-Crowd model to distinguish apps at reflecting users&#039; personal interests, and design a weighting method to rank the installed apps for users by combining the global download information with fine-grained app usage records.

Internetware can evolve continuously during runtime with the changes of its environment, thus to achieve higher software performance and customer satisfaction. So it is important to develop effective Internetware context awareness technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel multilayered context awareness technology. First, we build a three-layered architecture for Internetware to avoid disorderly context information transmission. Then, we utilize the ontology model language OWL to formalize Internetware context, to form a unified understanding of context information in the whole Internetware system. Finally, an extensible context management framework is proposed to drive different components in the Internetware system to access and operate related context information. In this proposed context management framework, we utilize the publish/subscribe mechanism to distribute context information and employ ontology libraries for context persistence. With these mechanisms, context awareness technology can facilitate Internetware evolution effectively.",

            "Abstract": "QoS-aware service composition has been widely addressed. When the optimal execution plan is determined, previous work generally assumes that the QoS attributes of component services are static for simplicity. Due to the ignorance of the dynamic nature of web services, the performance of a composed service is only partially evaluated. On account of the deviation of QoS attributes, execution plans have to be adapted at runtime in an unmanageable manner. Since it is unclear how the QoS attributes will vary, the effort of runtime adaption can hardly be assessed in advance. To solve the aforementioned problems, we provide a probability theory based approach to estimated the dynamic performance of composed services. The main idea is to cover the dynamic nature of web services with random variables. Following predefined aggregating rules, some crucial dynamic aspects of a composed service can be efficiently revealed from those of its component services even before the composed service actually executes, which makes it possible to determine the optimal execution plan in terms of some dynamic performance metrics. We also demonstrate some potential applications based on this better understanding of performance issues provided by our method.",

When the user interface thread performs lengthy operations, the user may feel that the application has become sluggish or frozen. This may lead to a negative user experience, poor review, and loss in market success. This paper proposes a static responsiveness analysis tool for Android applications to find potentially poor responsiveness defects which are difficult to detect by conventional testing methods as they are sensitive to the user environment. This tool finds responsiveness defects by discovering operations invoked in the user interface thread that may block the execution of other operations. We collect these operations according to Android developer guideline and previous related work. The proposed tool successfully found 45 potential responsiveness defects in seven open source Android applications.",

Asynchronous programming is in demand today because responsiveness is especially important on mobile devices. While major programming languages make asynchronous programming possible, they do not make it easy. In this invited talk we present our growing refactoring toolset that enables Android and Windows Phone developers to retrofit asynchrony. There are several challenges that our toolset addresses: reasoning about a programming model which inverts the flow of control, determining non-interference of asynchronous operations with the main thread of execution, converting from legacy callback-based idioms to the newer style, etc. Our empirical evaluation shows that our toolset is (i) highly applicable, (ii) accurate, (iii) safer than manual refactoring, (iv) it saves development effort, (v) its results have been accepted by the open-source developers, thus it is useful.",

            "Abstract": "Developing energy-efficient application is crucial for mobile platforms such as smartphone and tablets, since such devices operate on a limited amount of battery power. However, until recently most of the smartphone applications have been developed in an energy-oblivious fashion. This is increasingly becoming a concern due to the fact that smartphone applications are progressively becoming complex and energy-intensive, whereas the battery technology is unable to keep up. Existing studies have proposed a number of testing and re-factoring techniques that can be used to increase the energy-efficiency of such applications, after the development has been completed. However, we feel that maximum level of energy-efficiency can be achieved only if energy-efficient design practices are used in the software development process. In this study, we propose a set of energy-aware design patterns, specifically targeted at smartphone applications. These design patterns can be applied to huge number of real-life scenarios for energy-efficient information gathering and processing, within the smartphone application. We also present some examples of design patterns for application development for the Android platform.",

            "Abstract": "Android is the most popular platform for mobile devices. It facilitates sharing data and services between applications by providing a rich inter-application communication system. While such sharing can be controlled by the Android permission system, enforcing permissions is not sufficient to prevent security violations, since permissions may be mismanaged, intentionally or unintentionally, which can compromise user privacy. In this paper, we provide an overview of a novel approach for compositional analysis of Android inter-application vulnerabilities, entitled COVERT. Our analysis is modular to enable incremental analysis of applications as they are installed on an Android device. It extracts security specifications from application packages, captures them in an analyzable formal specification language, and checks whether it is safe for a combination of applications - holding certain permissions and potentially interacting with each other - to install simultaneously. To our knowledge, our work is the first formally-precise analysis tool for automated compositional analysis of Android applications.",

            "Abstract": "Multi-tenancy is a cloud computing phenomenon. Multiple instances of an application occupy and share resources from a large pool, allowing different users to have their own version of the same application running and coexisting on the same hardware but in isolated virtual spaces. In this position paper we survey the current landscape of multi-tenancy, laying out the challenges and complexity of software engineering where multi-tenancy issues are involved. Multi-tenancy allows cloud service providers to better utilise computing resources, supporting the development of more flexible services to customers based on economy of scale, reducing overheads and infrastructural costs. Nevertheless, there are major challenges in migration from single tenant applications to multi-tenancy. These have not been fully explored in research or practice to date. In particular, the reengineering effort of multi-tenancy in Software-as-a-Service cloud applications requires many complex and important aspects that should be taken into consideration, such as security, scalability, scheduling, data isolation, etc. Our study emphasizes scheduling policies and cloud provisioning and deployment with regards to multi-tenancy issues. We employ CloudSim and MapReduce in our experiments to simulate and analyse multi-tenancy models, scenarios, performance, scalability, scheduling and reliability on cloud platforms.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, web services (WS’s) have been widely used to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. In order to ensure a reliable WS system, a number of fault tolerance designs have been proposed. It is known that network connection and hardware devices may fail. In addition, the acceptance test (AT) as well as the decision mechanism (DM), which are common in fault tolerance designs, could also fail unexpectedly. Such uncertainties may affect the reliability of a WS-based system but have not yet been carefully considered in reliability modeling. Therefore, we propose extended NVP (ENVP) and extended RB (ERB) for the reliability analysis. Various operations of ENVP and ERB are discussed, and a simulation procedure is implemented to evaluate the system reliability and the failure probability of fault-tolerant WS-based systems. The experimental results show a high degree of correlation between the numbers of AT’s and the reliability improvements. The proposed fault tolerance designs could improve the system reliability, and the simulation procedure could also help in exploring appropriate configurations of fault tolerance designs for practitioners.",

            "Abstract": "Software product line (SPL) maximizes commonality between software products to reduce cost and improve productivity, where each product is represented by a selection of features that corresponds to particular customer requirements. SPL has been widely applied in critical systems such as communications, automobile, and aerospace, and ensuring correctness of the system is thus of great importance. In this paper, we consider model checking partial software product line designs, i.e., the incomplete designs in the early stage of software development, where the design decisions for a feature may be unknown. This enables detecting design errors earlier, reducing the cost of later development of final products. To this end, we first propose bilattice-based feature transitions systems (BFTSs) for modeling partial software product line designs, which support description of uncertainty and preserve features as a first class notion. We then express system behavioral properties using ACTL formulas and define its semantics over BFTSs. Finally, to leverage the power of existing model checking engine for verification, we provide the procedures that translate BFTSs and ACTL formulas to the inputs of the symbolic model checker $Chi$Chek. We implement our approach and illustrate its effectiveness on a benchmark from literature.",

            "Abstract": "It is commonly recognized that software development is highly unpredictable and software quality may not be easily enhanced after software product is finished. During the software development life cycle (SDLC), project managers have to solve many technical and management issues, such as high failure rate, cost over-run, low quality, late delivery, etc. Consequently, in order to produce robust and reliable software product(s) on time and within budget, project managers and developers have to appropriately allocate limited development- and testing-effort and time. In the past, the distribution of testing-effort or manpower can typically be described by the Weibull or Rayleigh model. Practically, it should be noticed that development environments or methods could change due to some reasons. Thus when we plan to perform software reliability modeling and prediction, these changes or variations occurring in the development process have to be taken into consideration. In this paper, we will study how to use the Parr-curve model with multiple change-points to depict the consumption of testing-effort and how to perform further software reliability analysis. The applicability and performance of our proposed model will be demonstrated and assessed through real software failure data. Experimental results are analyzed and compared with other existing models to show that our proposed model gives better predictions.",

            "Abstract": "Software testing is always an effective method to show the presence of bugs in programs, while debugging is never an easy task to remove a bug from a program. To facilitate the debugging task, statistical fault localization estimates the location of faults in programs automatically by analyzing the program executions to narrow down the suspicious region. We observe that program structure has strong impacts on the assessed suspiciousness of program elements. However, existing techniques inadequately pay attention to this problem. In this paper, we emphasize the biases caused by program structure in fault localization, and propose a method to address them. Our method is dedicated to boost a fault localization technique by adapting it to various program structures, in a software development process. It collects the suspiciousness of program elements when locating historical faults, statistically captures the biases caused by program structure, and removes such an impact factor from a fault localization result. An empirical study using the Siemens test suite shows that our method can greatly improve the effectiveness of the most representative fault localization Tarantula.",

However, GSE faces serious challenges related to the communication, coordination and provision of development environments for geographically distributed GSE sites, resulting in increased costs. Nowadays, cloud computing offers a cost-effective and a handy solution to provide computing support for global business. In particularly, it provides potential and viable solutions to address concerns and challenges in GSE. We have reviewed the relevant literature on cloud-based support for GSE and identified a set of pros and cons for supporting GSE with cloud services. We also present some recommendations to increase the trustworthiness and productivity with cloud-based support for GSE. This paper outlines the potential benefits and risks of cloud computing to GSE and identifies some gaps that need to be addressed by cloud-based support towards more trustworthy and productive work environment for GSE. This will open windows of opportunities for tailoring the solution utilizing cloud-based support for GSE.",

Optimizing ABE has been a dilemma because simplifying the procedure can reduce the estimation performance, while increasing the procedure complexity with more sophisticated theory may sacrifice an advantage of the unlimited scalability for a large data input. Motivated by an emergence of cloud computing technology in software applications, in this study we present 3 different implementation schemes based on Hadoop MapReduce to optimize the ABE process across multiple computing instances in the cloud-computing environment. We experimentally compared the 3 MapReduce implementation schemes in contrast with our previously proposed GPGPU approach (named ABE-CUDA) over 8 high-performance Amazon EC2 instances. Results present that the Hadoop solution can provide more computational resources that can extend the scalability of the ABE process. We recommend adoption of 2 different Hadoop implementations (Hadoop streaming and RHadoop) for accelerating the computation specifically for compute-intensive software engineering related tasks.",

The bug reports provide user friendly visualizations that can be easily traced back to the location where the bug was detected. We discuss one static analysis approach for detecting information exposure bugs and relate briefly the usability of our bug testing tool to empirical research. We conducted an empirical evaluation based on 90 test programs which were selected from the Juliet test suite for C/C++ code. We reached a true-positive coverage of 94.4% in 121 seconds for 90 test programs having a total of 12589 source code lines.",

            "Abstract": "So far, a lot of techniques have been developed on the detection of code clones (i.e., duplicated code) in large-scale source code. Currently, the code clone research community is gradually shifting its focus of attention from the detection to the management (e.g., clone refactoring). During clone management, developers need to understand how and why code clones are scattered in source code, and then decide how to handle those code clones. In this paper, we present a clone analysis tool with tag cloud visualization. This tool is aimed at helping to understand why code clone are concentrated in a part of a software system by generating tag clouds from a collection of identifier names in source code.",

A support tool called iArch slices a program from marked program points and generates an abstract design model faithful to the intention of the developer. The developer can modify the design model and re-generate the code again while preserving the abstraction level and the traceability. Archface, an interface mechanism between design and code, plays an important role in abstraction-aware traceability check. If the developer wants to obtain a more concrete design model from the code, he or she only has to make additional marks on the program list. We can gradually transition to model-driven development style.",

Manual feature location is a labor-insensitive task, and developers need to find the target entities from thousands of software artifacts. Recent research has developed automatic and semiautomatic methods mainly based on Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to help developers locate the entities which are textually similar to the feature. In this paper, we focus on individual IR-based methods and try to find a suitable IR technique for feature location, which could be chosen as a part of hybrid methods to achieve good performance. We present two feature location approaches based on BM25 and its variant BM25F algorithm. We compared the two algorithms to the Vector Space Model (VSM), Unigram Model (UM), and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on four open source projects. The result shows that BM25 and BM25F are consistently better than other IR methods such as VSM, UM and LDA on the four selected software systems in their best configurations respectively.",

Thus, especially in complex software projects, risks and inconsistencies are easily overlooked. In this paper, we present the concept of an Augmented Interaction Room (AugIR), i.e. a physical team room whose walls are outfitted with wall-sized touchscreens that visualize different aspects of a software system in the form of various model sketches. These sketches can be annotated by the stakeholders in order to explicitly mark important elements or indicate aspects that are critical for project success. The AugIR strives to support the collaborative work of heterogeneous teams and especially targets the inclusion of non-technical stakeholders into the communication process. Therefore, the AugIR continuously monitors the stakeholders’ design and modeling activities and analyzes the relationships between annotated contents to automatically uncover inconsistencies, contradictions and hidden potential project risks.",

            "Abstract": "It is common practice in software engineering to develop a product for the &quot;user&quot;. The concepts of users and actors typically oversimplify the variety of people that could use a system in a given scenario. By developing the system for actors, many software engineers effectively develop the system for themselves, embodying the abstract actors with their own personalities - i.e. how would I use the system if I was this actor? A single perspective may be sufficient for situations with a well-defined workflow, however, many systems in the social and domestic domains should consider people&#039;s emotional response to systems, which impact product acceptance. To ensure that emotional desires are met and that a product appeals to the intended audience, we advocate the use of personas within emotional scenarios. Personas and scenarios can be used to explore the diversity of people&#039;s background, emotions and motivations, and how they would react emotionally to design decisions. We describe our experience using personas and emotional scenarios in three projects related to people&#039;s health, where emotions are ever present, in the domains of aged wellbeing and mental health.",

The growing success of the Stack Overflow community largely depends on the will of their members to answer others&#039; questions. Recent research has shown that the factors that push members of online communities encompass both social and technical aspects. Yet, we argue that also the emotional style of a technical question does influence the probability of promptly obtaining a satisfying answer. In this paper, we describe the design of an empirical study aimed to investigate the role of affective lexicon on the questions posted in Stack Overflow.",

            "Abstract": "One of the guiding principles of open source software development is to use crowds of developers to keep a watchful eye on source code. Eric Raymond declared Linus&#039;&#039; Law as &quot;many eyes make all bugs shallow&quot;, with the socio-technical argument that high quality open source software emerges when developers combine together their collective experience and expertise to review code collaboratively. Vulnerabilities are a particularly nasty set of bugs that can be rare, difficult to reproduce, and require specialized skills to recognize. Does Linus&#039; Law apply to vulnerabilities empirically? In this study, we analyzed 159,254 code reviews, 185,948 Git commits, and 667 post-release vulnerabilities in the Chromium browser project. We formulated, collected, and analyzed various metrics related to Linus&#039; Law to explore the connection between collaborative reviews and vulnerabilities that were missed by the review process. Our statistical association results showed that source code files reviewed by more developers are, counter-intuitively, more likely to be vulnerable (even after accounting for file size). However, files are less likely to be vulnerable if they were reviewed by developers who had experience participating on prior vulnerability-fixing reviews. The results indicate that lack of security experience and lack of collaborator familiarity are key risk factors in considering Linus’ Law with vulnerabilities.",

This is based on conjectures around more ``eyeballs&quot; making bugs ``shallow&quot; -- whose validity and applicability are not without dispute. In this paper, we posit that the level of developer attention as well as its extent of diversity influence how quickly bugs get resolved. We report results from a study of 1,000+ Android bugs. We find statistically significant evidence that attention and diversity have contrasting relationships with the resolution time of bugs, even after controlling for factors such as interest, importance, dependency etc. Our results can offer helpful insights on team dynamics and project governance.",

            "Abstract": "Bug localization, i.e., locating bugs in code snippets, is a frequent task in software development. Although static bug-finding tools are available to reduce manual effort in bug localization, these tools typically detect bugs with known project-independent bug patterns. However, many bugs in real-world code snippets are project-specific. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for LOcating Bugs By Searching the most similar sample snippet (LOBBYS). LOBBYS detects bugs with the help of crowd-contributed correct code, which implement the function that buggy code is expected to implement. Given a buggy code snippet, LOBBYS takes two steps to locate the bug: (1) normalize the bug-gy snippet, and then search for the most similar sample snippet from the code base; (2) align the buggy code and sample code snip-pets, find the difference between the two code snippets, and generate a bug report based on the difference. To evaluate LOBBYS, we build one algorithm-oriented code base and select some buggy snippets from two real-world systems. The result shows that LOBBYS can effectively locate bugs for buggy snippets with high precision. Under the similarity of 50%, 70% and 90%, LOBBYS achieves bug-localization precision as 67%, 83%, and 92%.",

This helps developers to leverage the abundant and professional knowledge from massive programmers in Stack Overflow for issue resolution. CrossLink explores the semantic similarities as well as the temporal associations between the two types of repositories to recommend Stack Overflow posts to Android issues. The internal links in Stack Overflow are also employed to improve the linking accuracy. The experiments prove the effectiveness of CrossLink with precision of 62.51% for top-10 recommendations, which is significantly higher than the state-of-art method.",

            "Abstract": "The internetware system is a complex and distributed self-adaptive system, which challenges the method for making adaptation plans. Rule based approaches are very efficient to make plans in adaptive systems. To enable effective rule-based adaptation, we need to write a set of well behaved self-adaptive rules which could always lead to desirable states. This adaptive rules-set needs to be correct, com- plete, conflicts-free and well satisfy user goals, and it should updates according to user preferences. However, it is a difficult task for sys- tem users to define such a set of rules. To resolve this problem, we provide an rule generation engine, which could automatically generate well behaved self-adaptive rules according to user pref- erences. The rule generation engine is realized by a three-stage algorithm: stage 1 integrates user goals and user preferences, stage 2 establishes 1-1 tracing relationship between a context state and its desirable software configuration, stage 3 extracts self-adaptive rules from the tracing relationship between context states and software configurations. We will apply this engine to generate self-adaptive rules for a smart phone system, and evaluate the quality of generated self-adaptive rules.",

            "Abstract": "Developers usually use in-memory data caching system like Hazelcast with the application server to offload the backend database for scaling Internetware. Unfortunately, such caches do not integrate well with the database or the application. Developers need to take a large effort to rewrite the existing data access logic and manually manage the caching data. In this paper, we present EasyCache, a novel data caching approach, which provides transparent cache pre-loading, accessing and consistency maintenance to relieve developers of the burden of cache using and management. First, EasyCache translates each row of data in the existing database table into application cached object to pre-load cache data. Second, EasyCache allows applications to access the data cache using SQL statements and translates them into key/value based cache operations. Finally, EasyCache provides asynchronous/synchronous strategies to persist the cache data changes into the backend database. We design and implement EasyCache as a JDBC driver with Hazelcast as the caching layer. To evaluate our prototype, a detailed set of experiments were performed using the TPC-W benchmark. In the experiments, the only programming effort with EasyCache is point the application to the EasyCache JDBC driver. In contrast, when using Hazelcast as a traditional application-level caching system, we need to modify the TPC-W code over 2000 lines for 15 man days. Our experiments also show that, compared to a system with no cache and with query result cache, using EasyCache leads to up to 692× and 77× performance improvement respectively.",

            "Abstract": "In the Google Play store, an introduction page is associated with every mobile application (app) for users to acquire its details, including screenshots, description, reviews, etc. However, it remains a challenge to identify what items influence users most when downloading an app. To explore users’ perspective, we conduct a survey to inquire about this question. The results of survey suggest that the participants pay most attention to the app description which gives users a quick overview of the app. Although there exist some guidelines about how to write a good app description to attract more downloads, it is hard to define a high quality app description. Meanwhile, there is no tool to evaluate the quality of app description. In this paper, we employ the method of crowdsourcing to extract the attributes that affect the app descriptions’ quality. First, we download some app descriptions from Google Play, then invite some participants to rate their quality with the score from one (very poor) to five (very good). The participants are also requested to explain every score’s reasons. By analyzing the reasons, we extract the attributes that the participants consider important during evaluating the quality of app descriptions. Finally, we train the supervised learning models on a sample of 100 app descriptions. In our experiments, the support vector machine model obtains up to 62% accuracy. In addition, we find that the permission, the number of paragraphs and the average number of words in one feature play key roles in defining a good app description.",

            "Abstract": "Handling uncertainty in software self-adaptation has become an important and challenging issue. In our previous work, we proposed a fuzzy control based approach named Software Fuzzy Self-Adaptation (SFSA) to address fuzziness, a kind of uncertainty in software self-adaptation. However, our SFSA approach still lacks a tool to efficiently support the implementation process of SFSA. Existing tools for realizing self-adaptive applications does not directly deal with fuzziness in self-adaption loops. In this paper, we present the FuAET, a tool designed for building fuzzy self-adaptive software systems. The novelty of the tool is that it can not only provide a friendly GUI for editing and testing fuzzy self-adaptation strategies in intelligible domain specific language (DSL), but also automatically convert DSL-based fuzzy selfadaptation strategies into aspect-based programming code in native-language (NL), e.g., C++. This paper describes the design framework and implementation principles of FuAET, and then proposes a general development process using FuAET for reference to developers. Finally, we conduct an empirical study for evaluation of FuAET using an industrial control application. The results show that FuAET can automate the development of SFSA and ease the burden of the software engineers.",

First, the recommended contacts disturb friends least, that means, it will tell whether it’s suitable to call friends. Second, the recommended contact makes the communication information accessible to the friends and gets replies from the friends as soon as possible. For the goals above, SMoCoR takes friends’ calendar data and smart phone data as inputs, and after several steps of calculation it will recommend a list of contacts ranked by intelligent algorithm according to the appropriateness. The recommendation includes two aspects. Firstly, SMoCoR recommends whether it is suitable to make calls, which is named call recommendation. Secondly, SMoCoR recommends a list of the ranked text contacts, which is named text contact recommendation. The experimental results based on real-user data show that SMoCoR provides an effective method for contact recommendation.",

It is judged from three metrics -- the coherence of issue reports’ ID, the existence of an issue report’s basic information and activity information, and the completeness of changes on an issue report status. DQE will analyze the data submitted by users, and show users the data quality evaluation chart from three aspects. We had DQE applied to the GNOME community’s issue-tracking data that we collected for research, and we obtained the result of data quality evaluation. Next, we will continue to apply DQE to more software development data, so that we can help researchers and practioners conveniently get an initial evaluation of data quality.",

Many architectural description languages (ADLs) also provide software developers with support in specifying aspects in software architectures. However, when applied to describe trustworthy software systems, these ADLs face difficulties in using aspects to specify trustworthy attributes and maintaining consistency between the architectures before and after weaving of aspects. In this paper, we extend Breeze, a graph grammar supported ADL, to AspectBreeze. AspectBreeze allows trustworthiness aspects to be easily defined and seamlessly woven into base architectures. Further, architectures are defined along with graph grammars that allow any change to a base architecture to be reflected in the corresponding architecture in which aspects are woven. This paper also presents a case study of an online auction system to show how AspectBreeze is used and how graph grammars can maintain the consistency between the architectures before and after weaving of trustworthiness aspects.",

In the traditional FMEA, for each failure mode, risk factors of Occurrence, Severity and Detection are evaluated and simply multiplied to obtain a risk priority number. Besides, the weights of three risk factors are also ignored. To overcome these shortcomings of traditional FMEA, we propose a novel FMEA approach for obtaining a more rational ranking of failure modes by integrating entropy weighting method with &#039;Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution&#039;(TOPSIS). Finally, a case study about purchasing website is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the proposed approach.

            "Abstract": "Today’s Internet-based service systems tend to run in open environments and try to satisfy varying requirements. In the context, the changes of requirements and environments can emerge at any point of their life cycle, and their runtime variability is supposed to be evolvable to deal with the changes. In other words, the number, type or attribute of variability elements (variation points and their associated variants) in the systems is regarded to be changeable, especially at runtime. How to realise evolvable runtime variability in software systems is a challenge in the community of software engineering. Software architecture is supposed to support updating software without interrupting service if runtime variability is to be changed. Besides, the relevant mechanisms have to be provided to achieve dynamic update. Thus, we propose a dynamically reconfigurable reference architecture to construct the systems with evolvable software variability. The resultant system established using our approach consists of variability units and their containers. Variability units embody the variability elements that can be changed through local relay, i.e., starting a new version of variability unit to take place of older ones. Containers are mainly used to carry out the dynamic updating for variability units and realise the functionality invocation among different variability units. They can also be added, removed or replaced without shutting down the entire system. We analyse the requirements and scenarios of evolvable runtime variability in the case of Personal Data Resource Network, and further show the effectiveness and applicability of our approach by constructing the system using our class library and solving the issues proposed in the case.",

            "Abstract": "Internetware challenges distributed systems in aspects from operating platforms, programming models, to engineering approaches, etc. Cloud computing based on virtualization is now a popular paradigm which can meet the dynamic resource allocation requirements of Internetware. Software entities dispersed on distributed nodes over the Internet, now are evolving into self-contained, autonomous software services. These software entities which are often deployed on virtual machines (VMs), are coordinated dynamically to achieve flexible design objectives. To improve the utilization of infrastructure resource, VMs processing components of a software should be consolidated to fewer physical machines (PMs). However, as the increasing trends of communication-intensive softwares, data traffic among VMs should be considered as well. And for the sake of safety and QoS (Quality of Service), certain VMs (e.g. backup nodes) are mutually-exclusive which means some VMs require to be placed on different PMs. In this paper, we investigate the online software placement problem with the target to minimize the network traffic cost, while taking into account the mutually-exclusiveness of VMs. We provide a formal problem description and its NP-hardness analysis. The proposed algorithm places the VMs that have heavy traffic on the same PM, while isolating the mutually-exclusive VMs simultaneously, which can guarantee high effectiveness and reliability for softwares in Internetware, respectively. The simulations show our algorithm reduces the traffic cost by 29% compared against the existing approaches.",

The only limitation in software creation is human imagination, and that limit is often self-imposed. The “Internetware”, referring to a software paradigm, aims to satisfy the need of human kind using Internet as an integrated development and execution platform. Such software systems composed of entities distributed through the Internetwork, allowing connections that would be impossible or difficult to make otherwise [32, 33]. One of the tasks for the Internetware is to accommodate creativity, which is ever demanding currently. In particular, this is about: (1) to better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in human and (2) to design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves. Therefore, it can be summarised that an environment needs to be built under Internetware to best support human-level creativity.",

But their models and similarity metrics of WSDL analysis may ignore some term or semantic feature, and involve formal method problem of representation or difficulty of parameter verification. SLVM and its improved model depend on statistical term measures to implement XML document representation. As a result, they ignore the lexical semantics and the distilled mutual information, leading to text analysis errors. This work proposed a service retrieval method, hybrid SLVM of WSDL, to address the problem of feature extraction. Using WordNet, this method constructed a lexical semantic spectrum to characterize the lexical semantics, and built a special term spectrum based on TF-IDF. Then, feature matrix for WSDL representation was built in the hybrid SLVM. Applying to NWKNN algorithm, on OWLS-TC version 2 dataset, the experimental results show that the feature matrix of our method performs F1 measure and query precisions better than bipartite-graph matching and KbSM.",

            "Abstract": "Due to the increase in web services, non-functional or QoS parameters have been widely addressed. QoS-aware service selection is commonly formulated as an optimization problem aimed at achieving the execution plan that optimize the overall QoS parameter of the composed application while satisfying all the constraints on individual QoS parameters and considering all of the possible execution scenarios. In existing work, execution plans commonly assign one service for each task. For composed applications containing exclusive branches, some tasks may appear in multiple execution scenarios. Unfortunately, since one-fit-all services for these tasks considering every execution scenario are not always available, execution plans have to make compromise. As a result, when some users have strict QoS constraints, feasible execution plans may not exist for the composed application but exist for every execution scenario. This problem becomes more important and challenging for self-adaptive systems, due to the overhead of unwanted runtime adaptations. In this paper, we breaking such one-one mapping between services and tasks. We provide methods to divide all execution scenarios a task involved into exclusive groups (i.e. execution path set partitions) and show that a distinct service can be bound to this task for each group without causing any confusion. In order to find the optimal execution plan, we modify existing MILP based approaches to cooperate with our method. We also evaluate our approach experimentally using real dataset.The results show that it is more flexible, robust to QoS constraints, and can possibly improve the overall QoS associated with the optimal execution plan.",

Instead of shutting down a running system before updating, it is often desirable and sometimes mandatory to patch the running software system on the fly, with a mechanism generally referred as dynamic software updating (DSU). Practical DSU strategies often require manual specification of update points in the program for performing dynamic updates. At these points DSU systems will update the program code, and also migrate the program state to the new version program (using transformation functions). However, finding appropriate update points is non-trivial because the choice of update points has great influence on two competing factors: the timeliness of DSU and the complexity of transformation functions; and to strike a good balance between them requires a deep understanding of both versions of the program. In this exploratory paper, we conceive an automated approach to the recommendation of update points for developers. We conduct a set of preliminary experiments with a real world software update case to examine the feasibility of the approach.",
