  "Title": "Looking Glass: A Field Study on Noticing Interactivity of Shop Windows",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1126",
  "Authors": ["J&#246;rg M&#252;ller", "Robert Walter", "Gilles Bailly", "Michael Nischt", "Florian Alt"],
  "Affiliations": ["Quality and Usability Lab, Telekom Innovation Laboratories, TU Berlin", "University of Stuttgart"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper we present our findings from a lab and a field study investigating how passers-by notice the interactivity of public displays. We designed an interactive installation that uses visual feedback to the incidental movements of passers-by to communicate its interactivity. The lab study reveals. (1) Mirrored user silhouettes and images are more effective than avatar-like representations. (2) It takes time to notice the interactivity (approx. 1.2s). In the field study, three displays were installed during three weeks in shop windows, and data about 502 interaction sessions were collected. Our observations show. (1) Significantly more passers-by interact when immediately showing the mirrored user image (+90%) or silhouette (+47%) compared to a traditional attract sequence with call-to-action. (2) Passers-by often notice interactivity late and have to walk back to interact (the landing effect). (3) If somebody is already interacting, others begin interaction behind the ones already interacting, forming multiple rows. Our findings can be used to design public display applications and shop windows that more effectively communicate interactivity to passers-by."

  "Title": "Urban HCI: Spatial Aspects in the Design of Shared Encounters for Media Facades",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper340",
  "Authors": ["Patrick Tobias Fischer", "Eva Hornecker"],
  "Affiliations": ["Strathclyde University", "University of Strathclyde"],
  "Abstract": "Designing interactive applications for Media Facades is a challenging task. Architectural sized largescale screens can result in unbalanced installations, and meaningful interaction is easily overshadowed by the drastic size of the display. In this paper we reflect on urban technology interventions by analyzing their spatial configuration in relation to the structuring of interaction. We outline basic categories and offer a new terminology to describe these interactive situations designed for the built environment."

  "Affiliations": ["Quality and Usability, Telekom Innovation Laboratories, TU Berlin", "Quality and Usability Lab, Telekom Innovation Laboratories, TU Berlin"],
  "Abstract": "Most interactive public displays currently rely on flat screens. This form factor impacts how users (1) notice the public display (2) develop motivation and (3) (socially) interact with the public display. In this paper, we present Chained Displays, a combination of several screens to create different form factors for interactive public displays. We also present a design space based on two complementary concepts, Focus and Nimbus, to describe and compare chained display configurations. Finally, we performed a field study comparing three chained displays. Flat, Concave, and Hexagonal. Results show that Flat triggers the strongest honeypot effect, Hexagonal causes low social learning, and Concave triggers the smallest amount of simultaneously interacting users among other findings."

  "Abstract": "An ethnographic study reveals how professional artists created a spectator interface for the interactive game Day of the Figurines, designing the size, shape, height and materials of two tabletop interfaces before carefully arranging them in a local setting. We also show how participants experienced this interface. We consider how the artists worked with a multi-scale notion of interactional trajectory that combined trajectories through individual displays, trajectories through a local ecology of displays, and trajectories through an entire experience. Our findings shed light on discussions within HCI concerning interaction with tangible and tabletop displays, spectator interfaces, ecologies of displays, and trajectories through cultural experiences."

  "Title": "Invited Talk: Somaesthetics and its Implications for CHI",
  "Type": "Special Event",
  "Key": "sp105",
  "Authors": ["Richard Shusterman"],
  "Affiliations": ["Florida Atlantic University"],
  "Abstract": "Somaesthetics is an interdisciplinary research product devoted to the critical study and meliorative cultivation of the experience and use of the living body (or soma) as site of sensory appreciation (aesthesis) and creative self-stylization. An ameliorative discipline of both theory and practice, somaesthetics seeks to enrich not only our discursive knowledge of the body but also our lived somatic experience and performance; it aims to improve the meaning, understanding, efficacy, and beauty of our movements and of the environments to which our actions contribute and from which they also derive their energies and significance. To pursue these aims, somaesthetics is concerned with a wide diversity of knowledge forms and discourses, social practices and institutions, cultural traditions, values, and bodily disciplines that structure (or could improve) such somatic understanding and cultivation. As an interdisciplinary project that is not confined to one dominant academic field, professional vocabulary, cultural ideology, or particular set of bodily disciplines, somaesthetics aims to provide an overarching theoretical structure and a set of basic and versatile conceptual tools to enable a more fruitful interaction and integration of the very diverse forms of somatic knowledge currently being practiced and pursued. My talk at CHI will present the fundamental principles of the somaesthetic, examine some of its interdisciplinary impact and then explore its possible applications to the field of interactive design.

  "Title": "LightGuide: Projected Visualizations for Hand Movement Guidance",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1912",
  "Authors": ["Rajinder Sodhi", "Hrvoje Benko", "Andrew Wilson"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "LightGuide is a system that explores a new approach to gesture guidance where we project guidance hints directly on a user&#65533;s body. These projected hints guide the user in completing the desired motion with their body part which is particularly useful for performing movements that require accuracy and proper technique, such as during exercise or physical therapy. Our proof-of-concept implementation consists of a single low-cost depth camera and projector and we present four novel interaction techniques that are focused on guiding a user&#65533;s hand in mid-air. Our visualizations are designed to incorporate both feedback and feedforward cues to help guide users through a range of movements. We quantify the performance of LightGuide in a user study comparing each of our on-body visualizations to hand animation videos on a computer display in both time and accuracy. Exceeding our expectations, participants performed movements with an average error of 21.6mm, nearly 85% more accurately than when guided by video."

  "Title": "Understanding Flicking on Curved Surfaces",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper209",
  "Authors": ["Simon Voelker", "Christine Sutter", "Lei Wang", "Jan Borchers"],
  "Affiliations": ["RWTH Aachen University"],
  "Abstract": "Flicking is a common interaction technique to move objects across large interactive surfaces, but little is known about its suitability for use on non-planar, curved surfaces.Flicking consists of two stages. First, visually determining the direction in which to flick the object, then planning and executing the corresponding gesture. Errors in both stages could influence flicking accuracy. We investigated flicking interactions on curved interactive surface to evaluate which type of error influences accuracy. Therefore, we carried out three user studies to analyze how each stage of flicking on a curved surface is influenced. Our main findings are. 1) Flicking gestures are more accurate if horizontal and vertical surface are joined by a continuous curve than if they are separated by an edge or gap. 2) Flicking gestures on curved surfaces are mostly influenced by the motor execution stage of the gesture rather than the visual perception stage. 3) Flicking accuracy decreases as the starting point of the gesture is moved closer to the curve. 4) We conclude with a first mathematical model to estimate the error users will make when flicking across a curve."

  "Title": "MirageTable: Freehand Interaction on a Projected Augmented Reality Tabletop",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1700",
  "Authors": ["Hrvoje Benko", "Ricardo Jota", "Andrew Wilson"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research", "INESC-ID"],
  "Abstract": "Instrumented with a single depth camera, a stereoscopic projector, and a curved screen, MirageTable is an interactive system designed to merge real and virtual worlds into a single spatially registered experience on top of a table. Our depth camera tracks the user&#65533;s eyes and performs a real-time capture of both the shape and the appearance of any object placed in front of the camera (including user&#65533;s body and hands). This real-time capture enables perspective stereoscopic 3D visualizations to a single user that account for deformations caused by physical objects on the table. In addition, the user can interact with virtual objects through physically-realistic freehand actions without any gloves, trackers, or instruments. We illustrate these unique capabilities through three application examples. virtual 3D model creation, interactive gaming with real and virtual objects, and a 3D teleconferencing experience that not only presents a 3D view of a remote person, but also a seamless 3D shared task space. We also evaluated the user&#65533;s perception of projected 3D objects in our system, which confirmed that the users can correctly perceive such objects even when they are projected over different background colors and geometries (e.g., gaps, drops)."

  "Title": "How Screen Transitions Influence Touch and Pointer Interaction Across Angled Display Arrangements",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper396",
  "Authors": ["Fabian Hennecke", "Wolfgang Matzke", "Andreas Butz"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Munich"],
  "Abstract": "Digital office environments often integrate multiple displays in a variety of arrangements. We investigated the combination of a horizontal and a directly connected vertical display, which together form a digital workspace. In particular, we were interested in the effect of the physical transition (bezel, edge or curve) on dragging. In a study participants performed dragging tasks across both display planes with direct touch as well as a pointing device. Contrary to our expectations, we found no significant effect on task completion time. Only regarding accuracy the curved transition performed better than edge and bezel. Interestingly, the subjective judgment did generally not match the objective results. These findings suggest that we need to rethink our understanding of display continuities in terms of usability as well as user satisfaction."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper854",
  "Authors": ["Juan Pablo Hourcade", "Natasha Bullock-Rest"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Iowa"],
  "Abstract": "People are increasingly using wireless mice from across rooms as they use computers as entertainment centers. As a consequence, they often have to point at targets occupying small visual angles. In this note we present the results of a study on pointing performance for targets occupying small visual angles. Our results suggest there is a steep degradation of pointing performance in both accuracy and speed for targets occupying a visual angle below 3 minutes of arc."

  "Title": "Human Computation Tasks with Global Constraints",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1959",
  "Authors": ["Haoqi Zhang", "Edith Law", "Rob Miller", "Krzysztof Gajos", "David Parkes", "Eric Horvitz"],
  "Affiliations": ["Harvard University", "Carnegie Mellon University", "MIT CSAIL", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "An important class of tasks that are underexplored in current human computation systems are complex tasks with global constraints. One example of such a task is itinerary planning, where solutions consist of a sequence of activities that meet requirements specified by the requester. In this paper, we focus on the crowdsourcing of such plans as a case study of constraint-based human computation tasks and introduce a collaborative planning system called Mobi that illustrates a novel crowdware paradigm. Mobi presents a single interface that enables crowd participants to view the current solution context and make appropriate contributions based on current needs. We conduct experiments that explain how Mobi enables a crowd to effectively and collaboratively resolve global constraints, and discuss how the design principles behind Mobi can more generally facilitate a crowd to tackle problems involving global constraints."

  "Title": "Strategies for Crowdsourcing Social Data Analysis",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper554",
  "Authors": ["Wesley Willett", "Jeffrey Heer", "Maneesh Agrawala"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Stanford University"],
  "Abstract": "Web-based social data analysis tools that rely on public discussion to produce hypotheses or explanations of the patterns and trends in data, rarely yield high-quality results in practice. Crowdsourcing offers an alternative approach in which an analyst pays workers to generate such explanations. Yet, asking workers with varying skills, backgrounds and motivations to simply 'Explain why a chart is interesting' can result in irrelevant, unclear or speculative explanations of variable quality. To address these problems, we contribute seven strategies for improving the quality and diversity of worker-generated explanations. Our experiments show that using (S1) feature-oriented prompts, providing (S2) good examples, and including (S3) reference gathering, (S4) chart reading, and (S5) annotation subtasks increases the quality of responses by 28% for US workers and 196% for non-US workers. Feature-oriented prompts improve explanation quality by 69% to 236% depending on the prompt. We also show that (S6) pre-annotating charts can focus workers' attention on relevant details, and demonstrate that (S7) generating explanations iteratively increases explanation diversity without increasing worker attrition. We used our techniques to generate 910 explanations for 16 datasets, and found that 63% were of high quality. These results demonstrate that paid crowd workers can reliably generate diverse, high-quality explanations that support the analysis of specific datasets."

  "Title": "Direct Answers for Search Queries in the Long Tail",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper256",
  "Authors": ["Michael Bernstein", "Jaime Teevan", "Susan Dumais", "Daniel Liebling", "Eric Horvitz"],
  "Affiliations": ["MIT CSAIL", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Web search engines now offer more than ranked results. Queries on topics like weather, definitions, and movies may return inline results called answers that can resolve a searcher's information need without any additional interaction. Despite the usefulness of answers, they are limited to popular needs because each answer type is manually authored. To extend the reach of answers to thousands of new information needs, we introduce Tail Answers. a large collection of direct answers that are unpopular individually, but together address a large proportion of search traffic. These answers cover long-tail needs such as the average body temperature for a dog, substitutes for molasses, and the keyboard shortcut for a right-click. We introduce a combination of search log mining and paid crowdsourcing techniques to create Tail Answers. A user study with 361 participants suggests that Tail Answers significantly improved users' subjective ratings of search quality and their ability to solve needs without clicking through to a result. Our findings suggest that search engines can be extended to directly respond to a large new class of queries."

  "Title": "Distributed Sensemaking: Improving Sensemaking by Leveraging the Efforts of Previous Users",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1133",
  "Authors": ["Kristie Fisher", "Scott Counts", "Aniket Kittur"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft", "Microsoft Research", "Carnegie Mellon University"],
  "Abstract": "We examine the possibility of distributed sensemaking. improving a user's sensemaking by leveraging previous users' work without those users directly collaborating or even knowing one another. We asked users to engage in sensemaking by organizing and annotating web search results into 'knowledge maps,' either with or without previous users' maps to work from. We also recorded gaze patterns as users examined others' knowledge maps. Our findings show the conditions under which distributed sensemaking can improve sensemaking quality; that a user's sensemaking process is readily apparent to a subsequent user via a knowledge map; and that the organization of content was more useful to subsequent users than the content itself, especially when those users had differing goals. We discuss the role distributed sensemaking can play in schema induction by helping users make a mental model of an information space and make recommendations for new tool and system development."

  "Authors": ["Joey Scarr", "Andy Cockburn", "Carl Gutwin", "Andrea Bunt"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Canterbury", "University of Saskatchewan", "University of Manitoba"],
  "Abstract": "Designers of GUI applications typically arrange commands in hierarchical structures, such as menus, due to screen space limitations. However, hierarchical organisations are known to slow down expert users. This paper proposes the use of spatial memory in combination with hierarchy flattening as a means of improving GUI performance. We demonstrate these concepts through the design of a command selection interface, called CommandMaps, and analyse its theoretical performance characteristics. We then describe two studies evaluating CommandMaps against menus and Microsoft's Ribbon interface for both novice and experienced users. Results show that for novice users, there is no significant performance difference between CommandMaps and traditional interfaces -- but for experienced users, CommandMaps are significantly faster than both menus and the Ribbon."

  "Key": "paper484",
  "Authors": ["Andy Cockburn", "Philip Quinn", "Carl Gutwin", "Stephen Fitchett"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Canterbury", "University of Saskatchewan"],
  "Abstract": "We describe a method for applying gain to events reported by scrolling input devices such as scroll wheels. By treating document length as an input to our gain functions, the method allows rapid document traversal regardless of document length; it also allows slow and precise scroll control at shorter distances. An initial experiment characterises four diverse scrolling input devices -- a standard 'notched' scroll wheel, a high performance 'inertial' wheel, an isometric scrolling joystick, and a trackpad -- and the results are used to calibrate several gain function parameters. A second experiment validates the method, showing that it allows faster scrolling in long and short documents than current scrolling-device gain methods, and that subjective preferences favour it."

  "Title": "Aural Browsing On-The-Go: Listening-based Back Navigation in Large Web Architectures",
  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1053",
  "Authors": ["Tao Yang", "Mexhid Ferati", "Yikun Liu", "Romisa Rohani Ghahari", "Davide Bolchini"],
  "Affiliations": ["Indiana University"],
  "Abstract": "Mobile web navigation requires highly-focused visual attention, which poses problems when it is inconvenient or distracting to continuously look at the screen (e.g., while walking). Aural interfaces support more eyes-free experiences, as users can primarily listen to the content and occasionally look at the device. Yet, designing aural information architectures remains a challenge. Specifically, back navigation is inefficient in the aural setting, as it forces users to listen to each previous page to retrieve the desired content. This paper introduces topic- and list-based back. two navigation strategies to enhance aural browsing. Both are manifest in Green-Savers Mobile (GSM), an aural mobile site. A study (N=29) compared both solutions to traditional back mechanisms. Our findings indicate that topic- and list-based back enable faster access to previous pages, improve the navigation experience and reduce perceived cognitive load. The proposed designs apply to a wide range of content-intensive, ubiquitous web systems."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper412",
  "Authors": ["Waqas Javed", "Sohaib Ghani", "Niklas Elmqvist"],
  "Affiliations": ["Purdue University"],
  "Abstract": "The most common techniques for navigating in multiscale visual spaces are pan, zoom, and bird's eye views. However, these techniques are often tedious and cumbersome to use, especially when objects of interest are located far apart. We present the PolyZoom technique where users progressively build hierarchies of focus regions, stacked on each other such that each subsequent level shows a higher magnification. Correlation graphics show the relation between parent and child viewports in the hierarchy. To validate the new technique, we compare it to standard navigation techniques in two user studies, one on multiscale visual search and the other on multifocus interaction. Results show that PolyZoom performs better than current standard techniques."

  "Affiliations": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Wheaton College"],
  "Abstract": "Understanding how children perceive and interact with teachable agents (systems where children learn through teaching a synthetic character embedded in an intelligent tutoring system) can provide insight into the effects of so-cial interaction on learning with intelligent tutoring systems. We describe results from a think-aloud study where children were instructed to narrate their experience teaching Stacy, an agent who can learn to solve linear equations with the student&#65533;s help. We found treating her as a partner, primarily through aligning oneself with Stacy using pronouns like you or we rather than she or it significantly correlates with student learning, as do playful face-threatening comments such as teasing, while elaborate explanations of Stacy&#65533;s behavior in the third-person and formal tutoring statements reduce learning gains. Additionally, we found that the agent&#65533;s mistakes were a significant predictor for students shifting away from alignment with the agent."

  "Type": "Case Study",
  "Key": "cs191",
  "Authors": ["Manoj Prasad", "Tracy Hammond"],
  "Affiliations": ["Texas A & M University", "Texas A&M University"],
  "Abstract": "Teaching typically involves communication of knowledge in multiple modalities. The ubiquity of pen-enabled technologies in teaching has made the accurate capture of user ink data possible, alongside technologies to recognize voice data. When annotating on a white board or other presentation surface, teachers often have a specific style of structuring contents taught in a lecture. The availability of sketch data and voice data can enable researchers to analyze trends followed by teachers in writing and annotating notes. Using ethnographic methods, we have observed the structure that teachers use while presenting lectures on mathematics. We have observed the practices followed by teachers in writing and speaking the lecture content, and have derived models that would help computer scientists identify the structure of the content. This observational study motivates the idea that we can use speech and color change events to distinguish between strokes meant for drawing versus those meant for attention marks."

Our main pedagogical philosophy is presented which claims that problem-based learning activities are necessary for HCI education. To this end, appropriate new interactive media such as virtual worlds that can support these activities must be embedded in the educational procedure. The learning activities and the interactive tools that were used are presented. Key findings and educational implications are discussed."

  "Key": "paper1274",
  "Authors": ["Stefan Kreitmayer", "Yvonne Rogers", "Robin Laney", "Stephen Peake"],
  "Affiliations": ["Open University", "University College London", "The Open University"],
  "Abstract": "There is much potential for supporting collaborative learning with interactive computer simulations in formal education and professional training. A number have been developed for single user and remote interaction. In contrast, our research is concerned with how such learning activities can be designed to &#64257;t into co-located large group settings, such as whole classrooms. This paper reports on the iterative design process and two in-the-wild evaluations of the 4Decades game, which was developed for a whole classroom of students to engage with a climate simulation. The system allows students to play and change the rules of the simulation, thereby enabling them to be actively engaged at different levels. The notion of Contributory Simulations is proposed as an instructional model that empowers groups to make informed, critical changes to the underlying scientific model. We discuss how large-group collaboration was supported through constraining an ecology of shared devices and public displays."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington"],
  "Abstract": "One of the key challenges of video game design is teaching new players how to play. Although game developers frequently use tutorials to teach game mechanics, little is known about how tutorials affect game learnability and player engagement. Seeking to estimate this value, we implemented eight tutorial designs in three video games of varying complexity and evaluated their effects on player engagement and retention. The results of our multivariate study of over 45,000 players show that the usefulness of tutorials depends greatly on game complexity. Although tutorials increased play time by as much as 29% in the most complex game, they did not significantly improve player engagement in the two simpler games. Our results suggest that investment in tutorials may not be justified for games with mechanics that can be discovered through experimentation."

  "Key": "paper1378",
  "Authors": ["Rilla Khaled", "Gordon Ingram"],
  "Affiliations": ["IT University of Copenhagen", "University of Bath"],
  "Abstract": "Serious games have received much positive attention; correspondingly, many researchers have taken up the challenge of establishing how to best design them. However, the current literature often focuses on best practice design strategies and frameworks. Fine-grained details, contextual descriptions, and organisational factors that are invaluable in helping us to learn from and reflect on project experiences are often overlooked. In this paper, we present five distinct and sometimes competing perspectives that are critical in understanding factors that influence serious game projects. project organisation, technology, domain knowledge, user research, and game design. We explain these perspectives by providing insights from the design and development process of an EU-funded serious game about conflict resolution developed by an interdisciplinary consortium of researchers and industry-based developers. We also point out a set of underlying forces that become evident from viewing the process from different perspectives, to underscore that problems exist in serious game projects and that we should open the conversation about them."

However, defining exactly which challenges are important and which aspects of gaming experience are affected is largely under-explored. In this paper, we investigate if altering the level of challenge in a videogame influences people's experience of immersion. Our first study demonstrates that simply increasing the physical demands of the game by requiring gamers to interact more with the game does not result in increased immersion. In a further two studies, we use time pressure to make games more physically and cognitively challenging. We find that the addition of time pressure increases immersion as predicted. We argue that the level of challenge experienced is an interaction between the level of expertise of the gamer and the cognitive challenge encompassed within the game."

  "Abstract": "Recent advances in digital game technology are making stereoscopic games more popular. Stereoscopic 3D graphics promise a better gaming experience but this potential has not yet been proven empirically. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study that evaluates player experience of three stereoscopic games in comparison with their monoscopic counterparts. We examined 60 participants, each playing one of the three games, using three self-reporting questionnaires and one psychophysiological instrument. Our main results are (1) stereoscopy in games increased experienced immersion, spatial presence, and simulator sickness; (2) the effects strongly differed across the three games and for both genders, indicating more affect on male users and with games involving depth animations; (3) results related to attention and cognitive involvement indicate more direct and less thoughtful interactions with stereoscopic games, pointing towards a more natural experience through stereoscopy."

  "Abstract": "As HCI researchers have designed tools to promote wellness, disease has often been approached as a general problem. In contrast, public health research argues for an activist approach focused on how certain groups disproportionately experience disease and eliminating these disparities. Taking this activist stance, we examine how technology can reduce health inequalities by disrupting power relationships and helping communities pursue social change. We discuss our tool, Community Mosaic (CM), which allows individuals to share their healthy eating ideas with one another as a means of advocating behavior change. Our results characterize how CM helped facilitate activism (i.e., collective efforts to counter local challenges to healthy living) and shift users&#65533; attitudes regarding their role as advocates for health. We contribute to the field of HCI by using our findings to present a set of recommendations for future research focused on designing and evaluating health promotion tools using an activist lens."

  "Abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is to realize a method for modifying perception of satiety and controlling nutritional intake by changing the apparent size of food with augmented reality. As a possible method for decreasing rates of obesity, we focused on controlling food intake implicitly without any effort. We hypothesized that ambiguous perception of satiety can be applied to control our food intake. Recent psychological studies have revealed that the amount of food consumed is influenced by both its actual volume and external factors during eating. Based on this knowledge, we sought to control perception of satiety gained from the same amount of food by changing its apparent size. We also proposed a method for food-volume augmentation using real-time shape deformation. Our results suggest that this augmentation can control the perception of satiety and food intake."

Unsurprisingly then, the importance of food to our lives has long been recognized in the social sciences, and more recently, in Human-Computer Interaction. Yet, despite ongoing trends towards the digital augmentation of domestic environments, little consideration has been given to the impact of the material aspects of food consumption in the home. This paper takes an ecological approach to uncovering the role spaces, tabletops, and artefacts play in the social organization of domestic eating practices. Based on our findings of interviews with seven households in England, we discuss implications for those seeking to digitally augment domestic dining."

  "Abstract": "What does a user need to know to productively work with an intelligent agent? Intelligent agents and recommender systems are gaining widespread use, potentially creating a need for end users to understand how these systems operate in order to fix their agent's personalized behavior. This paper explores the effects of mental model soundness on such personalization by providing structural knowledge of a music recommender system in an empirical study. Our findings show that participants were able to quickly build sound mental models of the recommender system's reasoning, and that participants who most improved their mental models during the study were significantly more likely to make the recommender operate to their satisfaction. These results suggest that by helping end users understand a system's reasoning, intelligent agents may elicit more and better feedback, thus more closely aligning their output with each user's intentions."

  "Authors": ["Daniel Szafir", "Bilge Mutlu"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison"],
  "Abstract": "Embodied agents hold great promise as educational assistants, exercise coaches, and team members in collaborative work. These roles require agents to closely monitor the behavioral, emotional, and mental states of their users and provide appropriate, effective responses. Educational agents, for example, will have to monitor student attention and seek to improve it when student engagement decreases. In this paper, we draw on techniques from brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and knowledge from educational psychology to design adaptive agents that monitor student attention in real time using measurements from electroencephalography (EEG) and recapture diminishing attention levels using verbal and nonverbal cues. An experimental evaluation of our approach showed that an adaptive robotic agent employing behavioral techniques to regain attention during drops in engagement improved student recall abilities 43% over the baseline regardless of student gender and significantly improved female motivation and rapport. Our findings offer guidelines for developing effective adaptive agents, particularly for educational settings."

  "Authors": ["Saleema Amershi", "James Fogarty", "Daniel Weld"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington"],
  "Abstract": "We present ReGroup, a novel end-user interactive machine learning system for helping people create custom, on demand groups in online social networks. As a person adds members to a group, ReGroup iteratively learns a probabilistic model of group membership specific to that group. ReGroup then uses its currently learned model to suggest additional members and group characteristics for filtering. Our evaluation shows that ReGroup is effective for helping people create large and varied groups, whereas traditional methods (searching by name or selecting from an alphabetical list) are better suited for small groups whose members can be easily recalled by name. By facilitating on demand group creation, ReGroup can enable in-context sharing and potentially encourage better online privacy practices. In addition, applying interactive machine learning to social network group creation introduces several challenges for designing effective end-user interaction with machine learning. We identify these challenges and discuss how we address them in ReGroup."

  "Abstract": "Automatic localization of cultural resources and UIs is crucial for the survival of minority languages, for which there are insufficient parallel corpora (or no corpus at all) to build machine translation systems. This paper proposes a new way to compensate for such resource-scarce languages, based on the fact that most languages share a common vocabulary. Concretely, our approach leverages a family of languages closely related to the speaker's native language to construct translations in a coherent mix of these languages. Experimental results indicate that these translations can be easily understood, being also a useful aid for users who are not proficient in foreign languages. Therefore this work significantly contributes to HCI in two ways. it establishes a language that can improve how applications communicate to their users, and it reports insights on the user acceptance towards the method."

Using the features identified in this paper, our approach achieves an average F1 score of 0.81, and can correctly distinguish between actual command references and coincidental matches in 93.7% of test cases."

We employ an `augmented' storytelling methodology where we manipulate the modality of an `emotive' channel that accompanies the speech, and the contextual expectation of the listener. Comparing a remote upper-arm touch against a similarly timed flashing light, we explore the importance of the touch modality in affect conveyance. Our second manipulation involves two cover stories where the listener is told that the touch or flashing light is triggered either by the storyteller expressively squeezing a touch input device while speaking, or by measured `high points' in the mental state of the storyteller. Our results show that the story accompanied by communicative touch resulted in a significant increase in the sense of connectedness with the storyteller over the speech-only condition, and a trend toward greater affective conveyance."

  "Abstract": "Hybrid paper-digital interfaces are a promising approach for supporting language activities. The familiarity of pen and paper makes it a particularly attractive media for many user groups, including young children. Digital pens enhance interaction with traditional paper content by playing and recording audio and recognizing handwriting and gestures. Currently, generating custom interactive paper documents involves some programming, limiting its use by many user groups (e.g., educators and families) who might especially benefit from application of hybrid paper-digital interfaces in their practices. To address this need, we developed an end-user Toolkit for Authoring Pen and Paper Language Activities (TAP & PLAY). This paper describes the iterative development of the toolkit, its accessibility for novice non-technical users, and use in three different contexts for early language learning. We demonstrate and document the system's usability, generality, and utility for people who want to create and tailor their own custom interactive paper-based language activities."

The tabletop technology provides a central place where digital content, such as pho-tos, can be easily archived, managed and viewed. The tab-letop affords multi-touch input, allowing digital content to be sorted, triaged and interacted with using one or two-handed interactions. A physics-based simulation adds dy-namics to digital content, providing users with rich ways of interacting that borrows from the real-world. The field study is one of the first of a surface computer within a do-mestic environment. Our goal is to uncover people&#65533;s inter-actions, appropriations, perceptions and experiences with such technologies, exploring the potential barriers to use. Given these devices provide such a revolutionary shift in interaction, will people be able to engage with them in eve-ryday life in the ways we intend? In answering this ques-tion, we hope to deepen our understanding of the design of such systems for home and consumer domains."

Production teams are under continuous pressure to produce ever more creative and groundbreaking content while reducing the budgets and human resources required. While technologies are being developed for digitizing and streamlining sections of the production workflow, a gap remains between creative decisions made on location, and those made during digital editing and post-production. We describe a prototype tangible, tabletop interface to be deployed on a film shoot, which uses a storyboard as a shared data representation to drive team creativity. We define creativity in terms of team production, discuss our implementation and describe a deployment in which the prototype was used by a professional production team during a film shoot. Finally we describe a number of interesting interactions that were observed and consider the implications of our design decisions on the creative process of film making and the benefits of tangible, tabletop collaborative interactive displays in live film production."

We employed both quantitative measures such as computer log data and ethnographic methods to compare a baseline condition (normal email usage) with our experimental manipulation (email cutoff). Our results show that without email, people multitasked less and had a longer task focus, as measured by a lower frequency of shifting between windows and a longer duration of time spent working in each computer window. Further, we directly measured stress using wearable heart rate monitors and found that stress, as measured by heart rate variability, was lower without email. Interview data were consistent with our quantitative measures, as participants reported being able to focus more on their tasks. We discuss the implications for managing email better in organizations."

We report on the results of two user studies. The first one compares the quality of the set of thumbnails selected by the technology to sets selected by 31 humans. The second study examines the clickthrough rates for both email formats (with and without hyperlinked thumbnails) as well as gathering subjective feedback via survey. Results indicate that the email messages with the thumbnails drove significantly higher clickthrough rates than the messages without, even though people clicked on the main video link more frequently than the thumbnails. Survey responses show that users found the email with the thumbnail set significantly more appealing and novel."

Many of these prototype product ideas are quite good, but never see the light of day. At different times and within alternate companies they later become excellent products.

Companies often repeat innovation mistakes, without benefitting from the hindsight from others. I will illustrate many media based products I have been involved with and were left on the shelf, only to come to life later.

  "Abstract": "This paper examines the ability to detect a characteristic brain potential called the Error-Related Negativity (ERN) using off-the-shelf headsets and explores its applicability to HCI. ERN is triggered when a user either makes a mistake or the application behaves differently from their expectation. We first show that ERN can be seen on signals captured by EEG headsets like Emotiv&#65533; when doing a typical multiple choice reaction time (RT) task &#65533; Flanker task. We then present a single-trial online ERN algorithm that works by pre-computing the coefficient matrix of a logistic regression classifier using some data from a multiple choice reaction time task and uses it to classify incoming signals of that task on a single trial of data. We apply it to an interactive selection task that involved users selecting an object under time pressure. Furthermore the study was conducted in a typical office environment with ambient noise. Our results show that online single trial ERN detection is possible using off-the-shelf headsets during tasks that are typical of interactive applications. We then design a Superflick experiment with an integrated module mimicking an ERN detector to evaluate the accuracy of detecting ERN in the context of assisting users in interactive tasks. Based on these results we discuss and present several HCI scenarios for use of ERN."

We investigate these four challenges in a technical evaluation where we surgically implant study devices into a specimen arm. We find that traditional interfaces do work through skin. We then demonstrate how to deploy a prototype device on participants, using artificial skin to simulate implantation. We close with a discussion of medical considerations of implanted user interfaces, risks and limitations, and project into the future."

We measured the latencies for electric taste and visual stimuli as a basic evaluation for a content presentation system in which electric taste and visual content are synchronized."

Our experiences with the approach highlighted areas where designers and participants held radically different views.

To achieve this we modified participatory design techniques to foster respectful engagement with participants in the development of a digital aid to facilitate &#65533;safe walking&#8223;. The process begins with broad qualitative scoping and design work then moves to developing personally tailored, individual designs to further exploration of the experiential elements of the domain while reducing the need for the participants to engage in abstract thought. Reflection highlights a number of important areas that demand consideration when undertaking research in this area and, more generally, when performing design work with people with dementia."

  "Affiliations": ["Dalhousie University", "Yahoo! Research"],
  "Abstract": "We study how the visual catchiness (saliency) of relevant information impacts user engagement metrics such as focused attention and emotion (affect). Participants completed tasks in one of two conditions, where the task-relevant information either appeared salient or non-salient. Our analysis provides insights into relationships between saliency, focused attention, and affect. Participants reported more distraction in the non-salient condition, and non-salient information was slower to find than salient. Lack-of-saliency led to a negative impact on affect, while saliency maintained positive affect, suggesting its helpfulness. Participants reported that it was easier to focus in the salient condition, although there was no significant improvement in the focused attention scale rating. Finally, this study suggests user interest in the topic is a good predictor of focused attention, which in turn is a good predictor of positive affect. These results suggest that enhancing saliency of user-interested topics seems a good strategy for boosting user engagement."

  "Abstract": "Sentiment is a rich and important dimension of social interaction. However, its presence in computer-mediated communication in corporate settings is not well understood. This paper provides a preliminary study of people&#65533;s expression of sentiment in email conversations in an organizational context. The study reveals that sentiment levels evolve over time during the process of newcomers&#65533; socialization, that sentiment varies according to tie-strength with the recipient, and that sentiment patterns can be indicative of one&#65533;s position in the corporate social network as well as job performance. These findings shed light on the complex and dynamic nature of sentiment patterns, and would inspire further explorations and applications of sentiment analysis in organizations."

  "Title": "Eustressed or Distressed? Combining Physiology with Observation in User Studies",
  "Type": "Case Study",
  "Key": "cs169",
  "Authors": ["Avinash Wesley", "Peggy Lindner", "Ioannis Pavlidis"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Houston"],
  "Abstract": "In this article the authors describe a novel way to conduct user studies via the combination of a physiological and an observational information channel. The method enables not only the quantification of arousing emotional states but also their disambiguation into positive or negative instances. The physiological channel targets sympathetic responses and is materialized as a perspiratory signal extracted from thermal imagery of the perinasal area. The observational channel is materialized via decoding of facial expressions. However, while such decoding is usually performed in the visible spectrum, the authors have developed an algorithm to carry this out in thermal imagery instead. Thus, thermal imaging is used for both physiological and observational analysis. The potential of this dual unobtrusive methodology is demonstrated with some examples from a stress study, where users (surgeons in this case) interact with laparoscopic training boxes."

  "Affiliations": ["Carnegie Mellon University"],
  "Abstract": "Over the past several years, people have acquired more and more virtual possessions. While virtual possessions have become ubiquitous, little work exists to inform designers on how these growing collections should be displayed and how they should behave. We generated four design concepts that changed the form and behavior of these digital things, making them more present within a teen bedroom. We then conducted speed dating sessions to investigate how these new forms and behaviors influence perceptions of value. Sessions revealed how new technologies might better support self-exploration and reflection, as well as how they could complicate identity construction processes. Findings are interpreted to detail opportunities and tensions that can guide future research and practice in this emerging space."

However, new issues are emerging as families are increasingly left with the digital remains of their loved ones. We designed three devices to investigate how digital materials might be passed down, lived with and inherited in the future. We conducted in-home interviews with 8 families using the devices to provoke discussion about how technology might support (or complicate) their existing practices. Sessions revealed families desired to treat their archives in ways not fully supported by technology as well as potential tensions that could emerge. Findings are interpreted to detail design considerations for future work in this emerging space."

  "Abstract": "This paper examines issues of digitality and materiality of new media, grounded in a study of online TV watching in China. Particularly, by looking at how people make choices and decisions regarding TV watching in everyday life, we highlight material and digital properties of new media TV, and how they support and condition actions and interactions around them. The study illustrates that materiality and digitality are complementary, instead of one substituting the other, and are highly intertwined in the hybrid media environment around which meaningful experiences are conditioned and produced. It also suggests that an analytic distinction between materiality and digitality is fruitful in unpacking the complex relations between media technologies and social experiences."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper196",
  "Authors": ["Melanie Feinberg"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Texas at Austin"],
  "Abstract": "In the context of digital libraries and other online resource collections, the substance of interaction is generated to a large degree through the selection, description, organization, and arrangement of the aggregated items. Within information studies, researchers [such as 32, 6] have shown how individual events of selection and description inevitably form judgments about the collected materials. This paper describes a process in which designers purposefully use the elements of selection, description, organization, and arrangement to 'write' a resource collection as a form of rhetorical expression. The design process was implemented in two classroom settings. In the more successful second implementation, the role of the audience in structuring a rhetorical interaction was emphasized, and collection design was conceptualized as designing a dialogue between author and audience. The formalized critique of existing collection designs was a key element in enabling this dialogic orientation."

  "Affiliations": ["Mobile Life @ Stockholm University"],
  "Abstract": "Privacy is a widely studied concept in relation to social computing and sensor-based technologies; scores of research papers have investigated people's 'privacy preferences' and apparent reluctance to share personal data. In this paper we explore how Ubicomp and HCI studies have approached the notion of privacy, often as a quantifiable concept. Leaning on several theoretical frameworks, but in particular Nissenbaum's notion of contextual integrity, we question the viability of obtaining universal answers in terms of people's 'general' privacy practices and apply elements of Nissenbaum's theory to our own data in order to illustrate its relevance. We then suggest restructuring inquiries into information sharing in studies of state-of-the-art technologies and analyze contextually grounded issues using a different, more specific vocabulary. Finally, we provide the first building blocks to such vocabulary."

In an 18-participant laboratory study, we explore whether the keywords and captions with which users tag their photos can be used to help users more intuitively create and maintain access-control policies. We find that (a) tags created for organizational purposes can be repurposed to create efficient and reasonably accurate access-control rules; (b) users tagging with access control in mind develop coherent strategies that lead to significantly more accurate rules than those associated with organizational tags alone; and (c) participants can understand and actively engage with the concept of tag-based access control."

Previous research has examined motivations for sharing images online and has identified several key motivations for doing so. expression, curation of identity, maintaining social connections, and recording experiences. However, few studies have focused on the perceived risks of posting photos online and even fewer have examined the risks associated with provocative, controversial, or deeply personal images. In our work, we used photo-elicitation interviews to explore the motivations for posting these types of images and the perceived risks of doing so. In this paper, we describe our findings from those interviews."

Our findings suggest that location-sharing applications (LSAs) which support varying levels of location granularities are associated with sharing rules that are less convoluted, are less likely to be negatively phrased, and can lead to more open sharing; users are also more comfortable with these rules. These findings can help inform LSA privacy designs."

We define this quality as Source Interactivity [26, 29], and test its effects on user experience with a field experiment (N=141) of a portal site featuring cosmetic customization, functional customization and blogging (active versus filter). In demonstrating the psychological influence of source-based interactivity on such outcomes as user engagement, sense of agency, sense of community, intrinsic motivation and attitudes toward the interface, we discuss how designers can use them for creating interactive tools for self-expression."

  "Authors": ["Richard Guy", "Khai Truong"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Toronto"],
  "Abstract": "Visually impaired pedestrians experience unique challenges when navigating an urban environment because many cues about orientation and traffic patterns are difficult to ascertain without the use of vision. Technological aids such as customized GPS navigation tools offer the chance to augment visually impaired pedestrians&#65533; sensory information with a richer depiction of an environment, but care must be taken to balance the need for more information with other demands on the senses. In this paper, we focus on the information needs of visually impaired pedestrians at intersections, which present a specific cause of stress when navigating in unfamiliar locations. We present a navigation application prototype called CrossingGuard that provides rich information to a user such as details about intersection geometry that are not available to visually impaired pedestrians today. A user study comparing content-rich information to a baseline condition shows that content-rich information raises the level of comfort that visually impaired pedestrians feel at unfamiliar intersections. In addition, we discuss the categories of information that are most useful. Finally, we introduce a micro-task approach to gather intersection data via Street View annotations that achieves 85.5% accuracy over the 9 categories of information used by CrossingGuard."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Toronto"],
  "Abstract": "Learning an environment can be challenging for people with visual impairments. Braille maps allow their users to understand the spatial relationship between a set of places. However, physical Braille maps are often costly, may not always cover an area of interest with sufficient detail, and might not present up-to-date information. We built a handheld system for representing geographical information called SpaceSense, which includes custom spatial tactile feedback hardware&#65533;multiple vibration motors attached to different locations on a mobile touch-screen device. It offers high-level information about the distance and direction towards a destination and bookmarked places through vibrotactile feedback to help the user maintain the spatial relationships between these points. SpaceSense also adapts a summarization technique for online user reviews of public and commercial venues. Our user study shows that participants could build and maintain the spatial relationships between places on a map more accurately with SpaceSense compared to a system without spatial tactile feedback. They pointed specifically to having spatial tactile feedback as the contributing factor in successfully building and maintaining their mental map."

  "Authors": ["Navid Fallah", "Ilias Apostolopoulos", "Kostas Bekris", "Eelke Folmer"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Nevada, Reno"],
  "Abstract": "Indoor navigation systems for users who are visually impaired typically rely upon expensive physical augmentation of the environment or expensive sensing equipment; consequently few systems have been implemented. We present an indoor navigation system called Navatar that allows for localization and navigation by exploiting the physical characteristics of indoor environments, taking advantage of the unique sensing abilities of users with visual impairments, and minimalistic sensing achievable with low cost accelerometers available in smartphones. Particle filters are used to estimate the user's location based on the accelerometer data as well as the user confirming the presence of anticipated tactile landmarks along the provided path. Navatar has a high possibility of large-scale deployment, as it only requires an annotated virtual representation of an indoor environment. A user study with six blind users determines the accuracy of the approach, collects qualitative experiences and identifies areas for improvement."

  "Affiliations": ["University of York"],
  "Abstract": "This paper describes an empirical study of the problems encountered by 32 blind users on the Web. Task-based user evaluations were undertaken on 16 websites, yielding 1383 instances of user problems. The results showed that only 50.4% of the problems encountered by users were covered by Success Criteria in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0). For user problems that were covered by WCAG 2.0, 16.7% of websites implemented techniques recommended in WCAG 2.0 but the techniques did not solve the problems. These results show that few developers are implementing the current version of WCAG, and even when the guidelines are implemented on websites there is little indication that people with disabilities will encounter fewer problems. The paper closes by discussing the implications of this study for future research and practice. In particular, it discusses the need to move away from a problem-based approach towards a design principle approach for web accessibility."

  "Abstract": "User-Centred Design (UCD) can&#8217;t and doesn&#8217;t design on its own. Parasitic on software design, and appropriating participatory design, UCD is legitimated by what other design traditions allegedly do not do, rather than what UCD actually does make happen. Much Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research doesn&#8217;t design, proudly rejecting any need for implications for design. UCD is strong on problems, but weak on solutions. Such weaknesses have become masked by orthodoxy and disciplinary ideology. Direct challenges to UCD are not welcome within HCI research. As a step towards finding something new and better to believe in, this alt.chi paper parodies UCD as a basis for a critique of HCI values that identifies one possible way forward."

  "Authors": ["Jason Chuang", "Daniel Ramage", "Christopher Manning", "Jeffrey Heer"],
  "Affiliations": ["Stanford University"],
  "Abstract": "Statistical topic models can help analysts discover patterns in large text corpora by identifying recurring sets of words and enabling exploration by topical concepts. However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations--interpretation and trust--for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of 'word-borrowing' that arose from an iterative design process. Based on our experiences and a literature review, we distill a set of design recommendations and describe how they promote interpretable and trustworthy visual analysis tools."

A cadaster is an official register that records land properties (e.g., location, ownership, value and size) for land valuation and taxation. Such mapping of old and new cadasters can help historians understand the social/economic background of changes in land uses or ownership. With JigsawMap, historians can continue mapping older or newer cadasters. In this way, JigsawMap can connect the past land survey results to today and to the future. We conducted usability studies and long term case studies to evaluate JigsawMap, and received positive responses. As well as summarizing the evaluation results, we also present design guidelines for participatory design projects with historians."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1970",
  "Authors": ["Alex Endert", "Patrick Fiaux", "Chris North"],
  "Affiliations": ["Virginia Tech"],
  "Abstract": "Visual analytics emphasizes sensemaking of large, complex datasets through interactively exploring visualizations generated by statistical models. For example, dimensionality reduction methods use various similarity metrics to visualize textual document collections in a spatial metaphor, where similarities between documents are approximately represented through their relative spatial distances to each other in a 2D layout. This metaphor is designed to mimic analysts&#65533; mental models of the document collection and support their analytic processes, such as clustering similar documents together. However, in current methods, users must interact with such visualizations using controls external to the visual metaphor, such as sliders, menus, or text fields, to directly control underlying model parameters that they do not understand and that do not relate to their analytic process occurring within the visual metaphor. In this paper, we present the opportunity for a new design space for visual analytic interaction, called semantic interaction, which seeks to enable analysts to spatially interact with such models directly within the visual metaphor using interactions that derive from their analytic process, such as searching, highlighting, annotating, and repositioning documents. Further, we demonstrate how semantic interactions can be implemented using machine learning techniques in a visual analytic tool, called ForceSPIRE, for interactive analysis of textual data within a spatial visualization. Analysts can express their expert domain knowledge about the documents by simply moving them, which guides the underlying model to improve the overall layout, taking the user&#65533;s feedback into account."

We introduce social negotiation as the foundation of airtime sharing. We highlight negotiation mechanisms in the microenterprise, showing how shared resources are used towards personal interests amidst tensions and value conflicts, by adapting, modifying, subverting, and repurposing airtime. We then explore the design space of airtime and bandwidth sharing in low-income communities, including designing for negotiation and improving readability of airtime."

The objective was to understand the level of need for website creation by such entrepreneurs for their businesses and further, the challenges associated with website design and maintenance. The study was inspired by the phenomenal uptake of Internet use in the country coupled with a need to explore how micro-entrepreneurs are faring in this space, what potential exists, and how it could be realized. The findings of the study show that the Internet can be the new frontier for many micro-entrepreneurs who want to take their businesses to the next level. The study also provides critical insights into the realities of micro-enterprise, and hence relevant issues to take into consideration in seeking to take micro-enterprise online. The insights therein cover such issues as affordability of solutions, quick return on investment, convergence of current business methods and practices with those presented by an online environment for greater impact, and need for very simple, intuitive web design tools and platforms. Innovation may be required so as to come up with more website options that are better suited to the needs of micro-entrepreneurs and that are cost-effective. Alternatively other internet-based tools or platforms could be developed to help micro-entrepreneurs conduct business online. This is because the typical websites of today are not necessarily suitable for their needs."

In this paper we look at the deployment and of a bulk mobile text-messaging platform (Bulk SMS), conceived and commissioned by a health non-governmental organization (NGO) for use in communicating with the 100+ private health facilities. We show how the platform emerged from existing practices, the features and expectations of the system, and the ways in which it was used. Common failure points include infrastructural limitations, human error, and unexpected use cases. We find that 1) the use of SMS as a media enables new types of communication, and 2) SMS alone is not sufficient for maintaining relationships within the NGO program."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Glasgow", "SAMH Engineering"],
  "Abstract": "Thermal feedback is a new area of research in HCI and, as such, there has been very little investigation of the impact of environmental factors on its use for interaction. To address this shortcoming we conducted an experiment to investigate how ambient temperature and humidity could affect the usability of thermal feedback. If environmental conditions affect perception significantly, then it may not be suitable for mobile interactions. Evaluations were conducted outdoors in varying environmental conditions over a period of 5 months. Results showed that the ambient temperature has a significant impact on people's ability to detect stimuli and also their perception of these stimuli. Humidity has a negligible effect for most humidity values. Despite this, previous thermal feedback design recommendations still hold in varying temperatures and humidities showing that thermal feedback is a useful tool for mobile interaction."

  "Abstract": "PINOKY is a wireless ring-like device that can be externally attached to any plush toy as an accessory that animates the toy by moving its limbs. A user is thus able to instantly convert any plush toy into a soft robot. The user can control the toy remotely or input the movement desired by moving the plush toy and having the data recorded and played back. Unlike other methods for animating plush toys, PINOKY is non-intrusive, so alterations to the toy are not required. In a user study, 1) the roles of plush toys in the participants' daily lives were examined, 2) how participants played with plush toys without PINOKY was observed, 3) how they played with plush toys with PINOKY was observed, and their reactions to the device were surveyed. On the basis of the results, potential applications were conceptualized to illustrate the utility of PINOKY."

  "Abstract": "Shape change is increasingly used in physical user interfaces, both as input and output. Yet, the progress made and the key research questions for shape-changing interfaces are rarely analyzed systematically. We review a sample of existing work on shape-changing interfaces to address these shortcomings. We identify eight types of shape that are transformed in various ways to serve both functional and hedonic design purposes. Interaction with shape-changing interfaces is simple and rarely merges input and output. Three questions are discussed based on the review. (a) which design purposes may shape-changing interfaces be used for, (b) which parts of the design space are not well understood, and (c) why studying user experience with shape-changing interfaces is important."

  "Authors": ["Yusuke Nakagawa", "Akiya Kamimura", "Yoichiro Kawaguchi"],
  "Affiliations": ["The University of Tokyo", "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)"],
  "Abstract": "MimicTile is a novel variable stiffness deformable user interface for mobile devices that implements two key features. The first feature is an input interface that accepts a variety of deformation-based gestures, providing a user with several ways of interacting with a small mobile device. The other feature is the ability to provide information to the user through haptic feedback by varying the stiffness of the interface. The features are suitable for enhancing mobile applications. They were implemented using only shape memory alloy (SMA) wires as the actuator. SMA wire is extremely flexible, making it ideal for deformable user interfaces. In MimicTile, SMA wires act as both actuators and external input sensors. The actuator function works by altering stiffness based on user input. This study also discusses ideas for further development of deformable user interfaces."

We then describe how we tested the usability and educational potential of one of these mechanisms in a workshop where participants, age 9 to 15, made actuated electronic origami cranes. We found that participants were able to successfully build con- structions integrating SMAs and paper, that they enjoyed do- ing so, and were able to learn skills like circuitry design and soldering over the course of the workshop."

  "Abstract": "Many couples live a portion of their lives in a long-distance relationship (LDR). This includes a large number of dating college students as well as couples who are geographically-separated because of situational demands such as work. We conducted interviews with individuals in LDRs to understand how they make use of video chat systems to maintain their relationships. In particular, we have investigated how couples use video to 'hang out' together and engage in activities over extended periods of time. Our results show that regardless of the relationship situation, video chat affords a unique opportunity for couples to share presence over distance, which in turn provides intimacy. While beneficial, couples still face challenges in using video chat, including contextual (e.g., location of partners, time zones), technical (e.g., mobility, audio/video quality, networking), and personal (e.g., a lack of physicality needed by most for intimate sexual acts) challenges."

We made a pair of CheekTouch prototypes each with a multi-touch screen and vibrotactile display to enable bidirectional touch delivery. We observed four romantic couples in their twenties using our prototype system in a lab setting over five consecutive days, and analyzed how CheekTouch affected their non-verbal and emotional communication. The results of the user study showed that CheekTouch could effectively support audio-tactile communication in various ways - persuading, conveying status, delivering information, emphasizing emotion/words, calling for attention, and being playful."

  "Authors": ["Adam D. I. Kramer"],

  "Abstract": "In this paper we study large-scale emotional contagion through an examination of Facebook status updates. After a user makes a status update with emotional content, their friends are significantly more likely to make a valence-consistent post. This effect is significant even three days later, and even after controlling for prior emotion expressions by both users and their friends. This indicates not only that emotional contagion is possible via text-only communication and that emotions flow through social networks, but also that emotion spreads via indirect communications media."

  "Affiliations": ["Cornell", "Cornell University"],
  "Abstract": "Romantic partners face issues of relational development including managing information privacy, tension between individual and relational needs, and accountability to existing friends. Prior work suggests that affordances of social media might highlight and shape these tensions; to explore this, we asked 20 people to reflect daily for two weeks on feelings and decisions around their own and others' Facebook use related to their relationships. Most generally, we find that tensions arise when romantic partners must manage multiple relationships simultaneously because Facebook audiences are so present and so varied. People also engage in subtle negotiation around and appropriation of Facebook's features to accomplish both personal and relational goals. By capturing both why people make these decisions and how Facebook's affordances support them, we expect our findings to generalize to many other social media tools and to inform theorizing about how these tools affect relational development."

  "Authors": ["Miguel Malheiros", "Charlene Jennett", "Snehalee Patel", "Sacha Brostoff", "Martina Angela Sasse"],
  "Affiliations": ["University College London"],
  "Abstract": "Online display advertising is predicted to make $29.53 billion this year. Advertisers believe targeted and personalized ads to be more effective, but many users are concerned about their privacy. We conducted a study where 30 participants completed a simulated holiday booking task; each page showing ads with different degrees of personalization. Participants fixated twice as long when ads contained their photo. Participants reported being more likely to notice ads with their photo, holiday destination, and name, but also increasing levels of discomfort with increasing personalization. We conclude that greater personalization in ad content may achieve higher levels of attention, but that the most personalized ads are also the least acceptable. The noticeability benefit in using someone's photo to make them look at an ad may be offset by the privacy cost. As more personal data becomes available to advertisers, it becomes important that these trade-offs are considered."

  "Abstract": "We present results of a 45-participant laboratory study investigating the usability of nine tools to limit online behavioral advertising (OBA). We interviewed participants about OBA and recorded their behavior and attitudes as they configured and used a privacy tool, such as a browser plugin that blocks requests to specific URLs, a tool that sets browser cookies indicating a user's preference to opt out of OBA, or the privacy settings built into a web browser. We found serious usability flaws in all tools we tested. Participants found many tools difficult to configure, and tools' default settings were often minimally protective. Ineffective communication, confusing interfaces, and a lack of feedback led many participants to conclude that a tool was blocking OBA when they had not properly configured it to do so. Without being familiar with many advertising companies and tracking technologies, it was difficult for participants to use the tools effectively."

  "Abstract": "Media creation applications cater poorly to one very common usage. Situations in which the users need media that they do not own and for which they are unwilling to pay. Finding and using externally produced media is currently a cumbersome process. Often, users locate the content using a search engine, copy it into their work, cross their fingers, and hope they do not infringe on any copyrights. While the authors have shared hundreds of millions of images with permissive licenses, the license terms are too complicated for other users to follow. In our studies, we found that even the well-intentioned users still fail to respect copyrights in simple image reuse situations. We therefore introduce an Open Media Retrieval (OMR) model to remedy this problem and supplement it with prototypes that access various legal image sources directly within the creative work flow and provide automatic credits to the original authors."

  "Affiliations": ["University of North Carolina at Charlotte"],
  "Abstract": "Sharing information online via social network sites (SNSs) is at an all-time high, yet research shows that users often exhibit a marked dissatisfaction in using such sites. A compelling explanation for this dichotomy is that users are struggling against their SNS environment in an effort to achieve their preferred levels of privacy for regulating social interactions. Our research investigates users' SNS boundary regulation behavior. This paper presents results from a qualitative interview-based study to identify 'coping mechanisms' that users devise outside explicit boundary-regulation interface features in order to manage interpersonal boundaries. Our categorization of such mechanisms provides insight into interaction design issues and opportunities for new SNS features."

  "Authors": ["Thorsten Karrer", "Moritz Wittenhagen", "Jan Borchers"],
  "Affiliations": ["RWTH Aachen University"],
  "Abstract": "Direct manipulation video navigation (DMVN) systems allow to navigate inside video scenes by spatially manipulating objects in the video. Problems arise when dealing with temporal ambiguities where a time span is projected onto a single point in image space, e.g., when objects stop moving. Existing DMVN systems deal with these cases by either disabling navigation on the paused object or by allowing jumps in the timeline. Both of these workarounds are undesirable as they introduce inconsistency or provoke loss of context. We analyze current practices regarding temporal ambiguities and introduce two new methods to visualize and navigate object pauses. User tests show that the new approaches are better suited for navigation in scenes containing temporal ambiguities and are rated higher in terms of user satisfaction."

In the first quasi-naturalistic exploratory study on a focus-in-context video system, we show a number of unique object referencing behaviours, including un-intentional or 'implicit' pointing and a number of scenarios where this was advantageous. Additionally the study highlighted some of the problems inherent in aligning between screen-based and real-world perspectives."

Based on these results, we present Swift, a technique that supports real-time scrubbing of online videos by overlaying a small, low resolution copy of the video during video scrubbing, and snapping back to the high resolution video when the scrubbing is completed or paused. A second study compares the Swift technique to traditional online video players on a collection of realistic live motion videos and content-specific search tasks which finds the Swift technique reducing completion times by as much as 72% even with a relatively low latency of 500ms. Lastly, we demonstrate that the Swift technique can be easily implemented using modern HTML5 web standards."

In this paper we study the prospects of an automatic video remixing and present the results of a study on users' perceptions and attitudes towards collaborative automatic mobile video production. The three findings are as follows. People assess automatic video remix memorabilia as fairly equal to amateur-made manual ones, even if the manually-created video remixes are better in overall quality; as a remixing actor, a computer can be perceived to be more trustworthy than a human remixer; and, the quality of the video remix and the publication forum of the remix outcome plays a significant role when people are deciding whether or not they need public acknowledgement for their contribution. We conclude by discussing the design implications for collaborative automatic mobile video production."

  "Abstract": "Research in many fields argues that contemporary global industrial civilization will not persist indefinitely in its current form, and may, like many past human societies, eventually collapse. Arguments in environmental studies, anthropology, and other fields indicate that this transformation could begin within the next half-century. While imminent collapse is far from certain, it is prudent to consider now how to develop sociotechnical systems for use in these scenarios. We introduce the notion of collapse informatics - the study, design, and development of sociotechnical systems in the abundant present for use in a future of scarcity - as a complement to ICT4D and mitigation-oriented sustainable HCI. We draw on a variety of literatures to offer a set of relevant concepts and articulate the relationships among them to orient and evaluate collapse informatics work. Observing that collapse informatics poses a unique class of cross-cultural design problems, we sketch the design space of collapse informatics and provide a variety of example projects. We explore points of connection and distinction between collapse informatics and sustainable HCI, ICT4D, and crisis informatics. Finally, we discuss next steps and comment on the potential value of collapse informatics work even in the event that collapse never occurs."

This study used logs, a survey and interviews to evaluate a 15-week pilot with 303 households. It describes the Portal's design, and discusses its adoption, use and impacts. The system resulted in a 6.6% decrease in water consumption, and the paper employs qualitative methods to look at the ways in which the Portal was (or wasn't) effective in supporting its users and enabling them to reduce their consumption.

Designed to complement an existing water fountain with projected light and sound, the embedded installation encouraged people to take a drink, increasing the proportion of people who used the water fountain by 42% to 57% approximately for nine months. Sensors evaluated the impact of multiple interaction modalities on actual water usage. We found that subtle interaction can improve the experience of a space, in particular for those that use it frequently, and lead to sustained behavior change, especially when its modalities are responsive to the level of activity in the space."

We do this by critically interpreting the traces of interaction, user data populating the site, to understand the role of the systemic structures that shape the subject of interaction and in turn the experience. We approach this experience from the perspective of the \"subject of interaction\" as opposed to the \"user\" and introduce some benefits of such a strategy.

This experience has enabled us to probe the challenges of using biodata as part of broadcasting and formulate an agenda for future research that includes. exploring whether/how biodata can be acted and/or simulated; and developing techniques that treat biodata visualisations in similar ways to existing camera-based production processes."

  "Title": "The Role of Gender on Effectiveness and Efficiency of User-Robot Communication in Navigation Tasks",
  "Type": "TOCHI",
  "Key": "to122",
  "Authors": ["Theodora Koulouri", "Stanislao Lauria", "Robert D. Macredie", "Sherry Chen"],
  "Affiliations": ["Brunel University", "National Central University"],
  "Abstract": "Many studies have identified gender differences in communication related to spatial navigation in real and virtual worlds. Most of this research has focused on single-party communication (monologues), such as the way in which individuals either give or follow route instructions. However, very little work has been reported on spatial navigation dialogues and whether there are gender differences in the way that they are conducted. This paper will address the lack of research evidence by exploring the dialogues between partners of the same and of different gender in a simulated Human-Robot Interaction study. In the experiments discussed in this paper, pairs of participants communicated remotely; in each pair, one participant (the instructor) was under the impression that s/he was giving route instructions to a robot (the follower), avoiding any perception of gendered communication. To ensure the naturalness of the interaction, the followers were given no guidelines on what to say, however each had to control a robot based on the user&#8217;s instructions. While many monologue-based studies suggest male superiority in a multitude of spatial activities and domains, this study of dialogues highlights a more complex pattern of results. As anticipated, gender influences task performance and communication. However, the findings suggest that it is the interaction &#8211; the combination of gender and role (i.e., instructor or follower) &#8211; that has the most significant impact. In particular, pairs of female users/instructors and male &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers are associated with the fastest and most accurate completion of the navigation tasks. Moreover, dialogue-based analysis illustrates how pairs of male users/instructors and female &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers achieved successful communication through &#8216;alignment&#8217; of spatial descriptions. In particular, males seem to adapt the content of their instructions when interacting with female &#8216;robots&#8217;/followers and employ more landmark references compared to female users/instructors or when addressing males (in male-male pairings). This study describes the differences in how males and females interact with the system, and proposes that any female &#8216;disadvantage&#8217; in spatial communication can disappear through interactive mechanisms. Such insights are important for the design of navigation systems that are equally effective for users of either gender."

  "Affiliations": ["Carnegie Mellon University"],
  "Abstract": "Prior research has investigated the effect of interactive social agents presented on computer screens or embodied in robots. Much of this research has been pursued in labs and brief field studies. Comparatively little is known about social agents embedded in the workplace, where employees have repeated interactions with the agent, alone and with others. We designed a social robot snack delivery service for a workplace, and evaluated the service over four months allowing each employee to use it for two months. We report on how employees responded to the robot and the service over repeated encounters. Employees attached different social roles to the robot beyond a delivery person as they incorporated the robot's visit into their workplace routines. Beyond one-on-one interaction, the robot created a ripple effect in the workplace, triggering new behaviors among employees, including politeness, protection of the robot, mimicry, social comparison, and even jealousy. We discuss the implications of these ripple effects for designing services incorporating social agents."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Wisconsin--Madison", "University of Wisconsin-Madison", "University of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison"],
  "Abstract": "Virtual agents hold great promise in human-computer interaction with their ability to afford embodied interaction using nonverbal human communicative cues. Gaze cues are particularly important to achieve significant high-level outcomes such as improved learning and feelings of rapport. Our goal is to explore how agents might achieve such outcomes through seemingly subtle changes in gaze behavior and what design variables for gaze might lead to such positive outcomes. Drawing on research in human physiology, we developed a model of gaze behavior to capture these key design variables. In a user study, we investigated how manipulations in these variables might improve affiliation with the agent and learning. The results showed that an agent using affiliative gaze elicited more positive feelings of connection, while an agent using referential gaze improved participants' learning. Our model and findings offer guidelines for the design of effective gaze behaviors for virtual agents."

  "Abstract": "It needs to be investigated how humanoid robots may affect people in the real world when they are employed to express the presence, a feel of being there, in tele-communication. We brought Telenoid, a tele-operated humanoid robot, into a classroom at an elementary school to see how schoolchildren respond to it. Our study is exploratory and we focused on the social aspects that might facilitate communication between schoolchildren. We found that Telenoid affected the way children work as group. They participated in the group work more positively, became more spontaneous, and differentiated their roles. We observed that Telenoid's limited capability led them to change their attitudes so that they could work together. The result suggests that the limited functionality may facilitate cooperation among participants in classroom setting."

  "Abstract": "Online social networks have become indispensable tools for information sharing, but existing &#65533;all-or-nothing&#65533; models for sharing have made it difficult for users to target information to specific parts of their networks. In this paper, we study Google+, which enables users to selectively share content with specific &#65533;Circles&#65533; of people. Through a combination of log analysis with surveys and interviews, we investigate how active users organize and select audiences for shared content. We find that these users frequently engaged in selective sharing, creating circles to manage content across particular life facets, ties of varying strength, and interest-based groups. Motivations to share spanned personal and informational reasons, and users frequently weighed &#65533;limiting&#65533; factors (e.g. privacy, relevance, and social norms) against the desire to reach a large audience. Our work identifies implications for the design of selective sharing mechanisms in social networks."

Omnipedia highlights the similarities and differences that exist among Wikipedia language editions, and makes salient information that is unique to each language as well as that which is shared more widely. We detail solutions to numerous front-end and algorithmic challenges inherent to providing users with a multilingual Wikipedia experience. These include visualizing content in a language-neutral way and aligning data in the face of diverse information organization strategies. We present a study of Omnipedia that characterizes how people interact with information using a multilingual lens. We found that users actively sought information exclusive to unfamiliar language editions and strategically compared how language editions defined concepts. Finally, we briefly discuss how Omnipedia generalizes to other domains facing language barriers."

  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Google, Inc."],
  "Abstract": "We ask how to best present social annotations on search results, and attempt to find an answer through mixed-method eye-tracking and interview experiments. Current practice is anchored on the assumption that faces and names draw attention; the same presentation format is used independently of the social connection strength and the search query topic. The key findings of our experiments indicate room for improvement. First, only certain social contacts are useful sources of information, depending on the search topic. Second, faces lose their well-documented power to draw attention when rendered small as part of a social search result annotation. Third, and perhaps most surprisingly, social annotations go largely unnoticed by users in general due to selective, structured visual parsing behaviors specific to search result pages. We conclude by recommending improvements to the design and content of social annotations to make them more noticeable and useful."

  "Authors": ["Omar Hamdy", "Issa Traore"],

  "Abstract": "In this research, we propose a novel biometric system for static user authentication that homogeneously combines mouse dynamics, visual search capability and short-term memory effect. The proposed system introduces the visual search capability, and short-term memory effect to the biometric-based security world for the first time. The use of a computer mouse for its dynamics, and as an input sensor for the other two biometrics, means no additional hardware is required than the standard mouse. Experimental evaluation showed the system effectiveness using variable or one-time passwords. All of these attributes qualify the proposed system to be effectively deployed as a static authentication mechanism. Extensive experimentation was done using 2740 sessions collected from 274 users. To measure the performance, a computational statistics model was specially designed and used; a statistical classifier based on Weighted-Sum produced an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.11%."

We defined a comprehensive set of five-finger touch gestures, based upon classifying movement characteristics of the center of the palm and fingertips, and tested them in a user study combining biometric data collection with usability questions. Using pattern recognition techniques, we built a classifier to recognize unique biometric gesture characteristics of an individual. We achieved a 90% accuracy rate with single gestures, and saw significant improvement when multiple gestures were performed in sequence. We found user ratings of a gestures desirable characteristics (ease, pleasure, excitement) correlated with a gestures actual biometric recognition ratethat is to say, user ratings aligned well with gestural security, in contrast to typical text-based passwords. Based on these results, we conclude that multi-touch gestures show great promise as an authentication mechanism."

In terms of security, they are rather weak since the shapes are easy to steal and reproduce. In this work, we introduce an implicit authentication approach that enhances password patterns with an additional security layer, transparent to the user. In short, users are not only authenticated by the shape they input but also by the way they perform the input. We conducted two consecutive studies, a lab and a long-term study, using Android applications to collect and log data from user input on a touch screen of standard commercial smartphones. Analyses using dynamic time warping (DTW) provided first proof that it is actually possible to distinguish different users and use this information to increase security of the input while keeping the convenience for the user high."

Users can log into accounts by presenting the barcodes to webcams connected to computers. Through two lab studies and one field study consisting of 59 participants in total, we found that WebTicket can provide reliable authentication and phishing resilience."

We consider why music interaction research has become so marginal in HCI and discuss how to revive it. Our two discussion themes are. orientation towards design vs. research in music related R&D, and the question if and how private, big data on music interactions could enlighten our understanding of ubiquitous media culture."

We present a method for constructing a probabilistic model of color naming from a large, unconstrained set of human color name judgments. We describe how the model can be used to map between colors and names and define metrics for color saliency (how reliably a color is named) and color name distance (the similarity between colors based on naming patterns). We then present a series of applications that demonstrate how color naming models can enhance graphical interfaces. a color dictionary & thesaurus, name-based pixel selection methods for image editing, and evaluation aids for color palette design."

We conducted an initial study to identify the set of attributes users attend to when comparing workflows, finding that they consider result quality, their knowledge of commands, and the efficiency of the workflow. We then designed Delta to surface these attributes at three granularities. a high-level, clustered view; an intermediate-level list view that contains workflow summaries; and a low-level detail view that allows users to compare two individual workflows. Finally, we conducted an evaluation of Delta on a small corpus of 30 workflows and found that the intermediate list view provided the best information density. We conclude with thoughts on how such a workflow comparison system could be scaled up to larger corpora in the future."

Quickdraw can recognize sketched diagrams containing components such as line segments and circles, infer geometric constraints relating recognized components, and use this information to beautify the sketched diagram. Beautification is based on a novel algorithm that iteratively computes various sub-components of the components using an extensible set of deductive rules. We conducted a user study comparing QuickDraw with four state-of-the-art diagramming tools. Microsoft PowerPoint, Cabri II Plus, Geometry Expressions and Geometer&#65533;s SketchPad. Our study demonstrates a strong interest among participants for the use of sketch-based software for drawing geometric diagrams. We also found that QuickDraw enables users to draw precise diagrams faster than the majority of existing tools in some cases, while having them make fewer corrections."

To explore this, we created a heart rate communication probe that was used in two qualitative in-lab studies and a two-week field trial in participants' homes. Results show that heart rate feedback is a strong connectedness cue that affects the interaction in various ways, depending on a number of interrelated factors. In particular, we found two distinct categories of effects. heart rate as information and heart rate as connection. We propose two mechanisms that could explain these observations and draw out the implications they have for future use of heartbeat communication to support social connectedness or other aspects of social interaction."

  "Authors": ["Laura Dabbish", "Robert Kraut", "Jordan Patton"],
  "Affiliations": ["Carnegie Mellon University"],
  "Abstract": "Theories about commitment in online settings and empirical evidence from offline environments suggest that greater communication in online groups should lead members to become more committed and participate longer. However, experimental evidence is sparse, in part because of difficulties inducing communication online. Moreover, previous work has not identified the route by which communication leads to increased commitment. In this paper, we investigated whether task versus social communication modeled by a leader versus a peer influenced the amount that group members talked and their willingness to continue participating in the group. We conducted an experiment within ad hoc groups in the online game World of Warcraft. Results suggest that communication early in a group&#65533;s history causes members to talk more later on and that the early communication increases their commitment through its influence on group atmosphere rather than through increased member participation. Social communication by a peer is especially valuable in increasing commitment."

  "Abstract": "Millions of recommendations, opinions and experiences are shared across popular microblogging platforms and services each day. Yet much of this content becomes quickly lost in the stream shortly after being posted. This paper looks at the feasibility of identifying useful content in microblog streams so that it might be archived to facilitate wider access and reference. Towards this goal, we present an experiment with a game-with-a-purpose called \\emph{Twiage} that we designed to determine how well the deluge of content in &#65533;raw&#65533; microblog streams could be turned into filtered and ranked collections using ratings from players. Experiments with Twiage validate the feasibility of applying human-computation to this problem, finding strong agreement about what constitutes the ``most useful'' content in our test dataset. Second, we compare the effectiveness of various methods of eliciting such ratings, finding that a &#65533;choose-best&#65533; interface and Elo rating ranking scheme yield the greatest agreement in the fewest rounds. External validation of resulting top-rated twitter content with a domain expert found that while the top Twiage-ranked &#65533;tweets&#65533; were among the best of the set, there was a tendency for players to also select what we term &#65533;weak spam&#65533; -- e.g., promotional content disguised as articles or reviews, indicating a need for more stringent content filtering."

Here, we present the findings of our 31-week long field study and deployment of e-ESAS &#65533; the first mobile-based remote symptom monitoring system (RSMS) developed for rural BC patients where patients are the prime users rather than just the source of data collection at some point of time. We have also shown how &#65533;motivation&#65533; and &#65533;automation&#65533; have been integrated in e-ESAS and creating a unique motivation-persuasion-motivation cycle where the motivated patients become proactive change agents by persuading others. Though in its early deployment stages (2 months), e-ESAS demonstrates the potential to positively impact the cancer care by (1) helping the doctors with graphical charts of long symptom history (automation), (2) facilitating timely interventions through alert generation (automation) and (3) improving three way communications (doctor-patient-attendant) for a better decision making process (motivation) and thereby improving the quality of life of BC patients."

  "Abstract": "This paper explores some of the problems encountered in using a data archive to build tools for training radiologists to interpret breast screening images. We detail our experiences of taking images and case notes created as part of the work of breast cancer screening and using them as resources for training. Four instances of the use of the archive in training are described in detail and the problems they reveal are discussed. We formulate some general lessons for the mobility and re-use of rich ensembles of data and artefacts drawn from complex professional settings. We argue for a richer representation of the context from which the data was taken than can be achieved through making selected relations explicit in metadata. We also conclude that facilities for correcting and elaborating data should be available at the point of use, and not separated out as distinct activities."

  "Abstract": "Monitoring nutritional intake is an important aspect of the care of older people, particularly for those at risk of malnutrition. Current practice for monitoring food intake relies on hand written food charts that have several inadequacies. We describe the design and validation of a tool for computer-assisted visual assessment of patient food and nutrient intake. To estimate food consumption, the application compares the pixels the user rubbed out against predefined graphical masks. Weight of food consumed is calculated as a percentage of pixels rubbed out against pixels in the mask. Results suggest that the application may be a useful tool for the conservative assessment of nutritional intake in hospitals."

  "Abstract": "Online health communities that engage the patient as a whole person attend to personal and medical needs in a holistic manner. Whether current communities structure interaction between health professionals and patients to address the whole person is an open question. To gain insights into this question, we examined a sample of online patient communities to understand health professionals' involvement in bringing in medical advice into peer-patient conversations. We found the communities fall short in supporting the whole person, because (1) patient expertise and clinical expertise generated by health professionals are shared separately, and (2) patients' quantified data are separate from narrative experiences. Such separation in the design of these systems can lead to limitations in addressing patients' interwoven medical and personal concerns. We discuss dilemmas and design implications for supporting the whole person in online patient communities."

The primary motivation here is to avoid contact during interaction with data so as to maintain asepsis. However, there is another important property of touchless interaction that has significant implications for their use within such settings &#65533; namely that interaction behaviour is spatially distal from the device being interacted with. To further understand these implications we present fieldwork observations of work practice in neurosurgery theatres. Drawing on the notion of interaction proxemics and the theory of F-formations, our analysis articulates the spatial organization of collaborative work practices and interaction in these settings. From this understanding of spatial practices, we discuss opportunities and difficulties relating to the design of touchless interaction technologies for in surgical settings."

We conducted a study to investigate the natural use profiles of PTA, which describes the features of PTA in the course of normal pen use such as writing and drawing. First, the study reveals the ranges of PTA in normal pen use, which can distinguish pen events accidently occurring in normal drawing and writing from those used for mode switch. The natural use profiles also show that azimuth is least likely to cause false pen mode switching while tip pressure is most likely to cause false pen mode switching. Second, the study reveals correlations among various modalities, indicating that pressure plus azimuth is superior to other pairs for dual-modality control."

  "Abstract": "To combine the affordance of paper and computers, prior research has proposed numerous interactive paper systems that link specific paper document content to digital operations such as multimedia playback and proofreading. Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average novice user learn to master an interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao, et al., 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With PapierCraft, people can select sections of printed documents and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a Table PC-based interface supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined the application of the command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordance. In addition, our study reveals some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This paper contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction."

  "Abstract": "The human hand can naturally coordinate multiple finger joints, and simultaneously tilt, press and roll a pen to write or draw. For this reason, digital pens are now embedded with auxiliary input sensors to capture these actions. Prior research on auxiliary input channels has mainly investigated them in isolation of one another. In this work, we explore the coordinated use of two auxiliary channels, a class of interaction techniques we refer to as a-coord input. Through two separate experiments, we explore the design space of a-coord input. In the first study we identify if users can successfully coordinate two auxiliary channels. We found a strong degree of coordination between channels. In a second experiment, we evaluate the effectiveness of a-coord input in a task with multiple steps, such as multi-parameter selection and manipulation. We find that a-coord input facilitates coordination even with a complex, aforethought sequential task. Overall our results indicate that users can control at least two auxiliary input channels in conjunction which can facilitate a number of common tasks can on the pen."

  "Authors": ["Leah Findlater", "Jacob O Wobbrock"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington"],
  "Abstract": "Although typing on touchscreens is slower than typing on physical keyboards, touchscreens offer a critical potential advantage. they are software-based, and, as such, the keyboard layout and classification models used to interpret key presses can dynamically adapt to suit each user&#65533;s typing pattern. To explore this potential, we introduce and evaluate two novel personalized keyboard interfaces, both of which adapt their underlying key-press classification models. The first keyboard also visually adapts the location of keys while the second one always maintains a visually stable rectangular layout. A three-session user evaluation showed that the keyboard with the stable rectangular layout significantly improved typing speed compared to a control condition with no personalization. Although no similar benefit was found for the keyboard that also offered visual adaptation, overall subjective response to both new touchscreen keyboards was positive. As personalized keyboards are still an emerging area of research, we also outline a design space that includes dimensions of adaptation and key-press classification features."

To activate the menu system, users create a pinch gesture with either their index or middle finger to initiate a left click or right click. Then they mark in the 3D space near the interactive area. We demonstrate how the system can be implemented using a commodity range camera such as the Microsoft Kinect, and report on several designs of the 3D marking system. Like the multi-touch marking menu, our system offers a large number of accessible commands. Since it does not rely on contact points to operate, our system leaves the non-dominant hand available for other multi-touch interactions."

  "Abstract": "In this essay, I explore several facets of research through design in order to contribute to discussions about how the approach should develop. The essay has three parts. In the first, I review two influential theories from the Philosophy of Science to help reflect on the nature of design theory, concluding that research through design is likely to produce theories that are provisional, contingent, and aspirational. In the second part, I discuss three possible interpretations for the diversity of approaches to research through design, and suggest that this variation need not be seen as a sign of inadequate standards or a lack of cumulative progress in the field, but may be natural for a generative endeavour. In the final section, I suggest that, rather than aiming to develop increasingly comprehensive theories of design, practice based research might better view theory as annotation of realised design examples, and particularly portfolios of related pieces. Overall, I suggest that the design research community should be wary of impulses towards convergence and standardisation, and instead take pride in its aptitude for exploring and speculating, particularising and diversifying, and - especially - its ability to manifest the results in the form of new, conceptually rich artefacts."

  "Abstract": "In this paper we provide a critical analysis of persuasive sustainability research from 2009-2011. Drawing on critical sociological theory of modernism, we argue that persuasion is based on a limited framing of sustainability, human behavior, and their interrelation-ship. This makes supporting sustainability easier, but leads to characteristic patterns of breakdown. We then detail problems that emerge from this narrowing of vision, such as how the framing of sustainability as the optimization of a simple metrics places technologies incorrectly as objective arbiters over complex issues of sustainability. We conclude by suggesting alternative approaches to move beyond these problems."

  "Abstract": "Motivated by substantive concerns with the limitations and negative effects of technology, this paper inquires into the negation of technology as an explicit and intentional aspect of design research within HCI. Building on theory from areas including philosophy and design theory, this paper articulates a theoretical framework for conceptualizing the intentional negation of technology (i.e., the undesign of technology), ranging from the inhibition of particular uses of technology to the total erasure or foreclosure of technology. The framework is then expanded upon to articulate additional areas of undesigning, including self-inhibition, exclusion, removal, replacement, restoration, and safeguarding. In conclusion a scheme is offered for addressing questions concerning the disciplinary scope of undesign in the context of HCI, along with suggestions for ways that undesigning may be more strongly incorporated within HCI research."

  "Abstract": "Interpretations of the concept of 'affordances' in HCI are becoming increasingly diverse, extending well beyond the original Gibsonian meaning. We discuss some of the key analyses of affordances in HCI research and make three related claims. First, we argue that many current interpretations of the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second, we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances, conceptualized as interaction between animals and their environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson's ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational property of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment. We conclude with a discussion of prospects for future conceptual and empirical explorations of the meditational perspective in HCI research."

  "Abstract": "Lightweight spatially aware displays (Tangible Magic Lenses) are an effective approach for exploring complex information spaces within a tabletop environment. One way of using the 3D space above a horizontal surface is to divide it into discrete parallel layers stacked upon each other. Horizontal and vertical lens movements are essential tasks for the style of multi-layer interaction associated with it. We conducted a comprehensive user study with 18 participants investigating fundamental issues such as optimal number of layers and their thickness, movement and holding accuracies, and physical boundaries of the interaction volume. Findings include a rather limited overall interaction height (44 cm), a different minimal layer thickness for vertical and horizontal search tasks (1 cm/4 cm), a reasonable maximum number of layers depending on the primary task, and a convenience zone in the middle for horizontal search. Derived from that, design guidelines are also presented."

  "Abstract": "This paper reports an empirical investigation in which participants produced a set of stroke gestures with varying degrees of complexity and in different target sizes using both the finger and the pen. The recorded gestures were then analyzed according to multiple measures characterizing many aspects of stroke gestures. Our findings were as follows. (1) Finger drawn gestures were quite different to pen drawn gestures in basic measures including size ratio and average speed. Finger drawn gestures tended to be larger and faster than pen drawn gestures. They also differed in shape geometry as measured by, for example, aperture of closed gestures, corner shape distance and intersecting points deviation; (2) Pen drawn gestures and finger drawn gestures were similar in several measures including articulation time, indicative angle difference, axial symmetry and proportional shape distance; (3) There were interaction effects between gesture implement (finger vs. pen) and target gesture size and gesture complexity. Our findings show that half of the features we tested were performed well enough by the finger. This finding suggests that 'finger friendly' systems should exploit these features when designing finger interfaces and avoid using the other features in which the finger does not perform as well as the pen."

  "Authors": ["Peng Song", "Wooi Boon Goh", "William Hutama", "Chi-Wing Fu", "Xiaopei Liu"],
  "Affiliations": ["Nanyang Technological University", "Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],
  "Abstract": "Commercial 3D scene acquisition systems such as the Microsoft Kinect sensor can reduce the cost barrier of realizing mid-air interaction. However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D manipulation operations is proposed to manipulate single objects, perform fast constrained rotation, and pack/align multiple objects along a line. Three user studies were devised to demonstrate the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed interaction techniques on different virtual manipulation scenarios."

Recently, canvas presentation tools such as Fly or Prezi have begun to use a zoomable free-form canvas to arrange information instead. While their effect on authoring presentations has been evaluated previously, we studied how they impact the audience. In a quantitative study, we compared audience retention and macrostructure understanding of slide deck vs. canvas presentations. We found both approaches to be equally capable of communicating information to the audience. Canvas presentations, however, were rated by participants to better aid them in staying oriented during a talk. This makes canvas presentation tools a promising slideware alternative."

Ferromagnetic particles, such as iron &#64257;lings, have very fascinating characteristics. Therefore they are widely used in art, education and as toys. Besides their potential to enable visual and tactile feedback and to be used as a medium for high resolution tangible input, peoples natural desire to engage and explore the behavior of this material makes them interesting for HCI. Inspired by the expressiveness of sand drawing, we want to explore ways to use an electromagnetic array, camera feedback, computer vision, and ferromagnetic particles to produce animations. The currently used magnetic actuation device consists of a 3 by 3 coil array. Even with such a small number of actuators, we are able demonstrate several animation examples."

  "Abstract": "A deficit in social communication is one of a number of core features of autism that can result in the exclusion of individuals with autism from the design process. Individuals with autism can be highly motivated by new technology, and the design of technologies for individuals with autism could potentially benefit from their direct input. We structured participatory design sessions using Cooperative Inquiry specifically to support the needs of individuals with autism. This video highlights how, when appropriately supported, the challenges of the social communication deficits associated with autism can be overcome and individuals with autism can take a full and active role within the design process."

  "Affiliations": ["MIT Media Lab"],
  "Abstract": "The tongue is known to have an extremely dense sensing resolution, as well as an extraordinary degree of neuroplasticity, the ability to adapt to and internalize new input. Research has shown that electro-tactile tongue displays paired with cameras can be used as vision prosthetics for the blind or visually impaired; users quickly learn to read and navigate through natural environments, and many describe the signals as an innate sense. However, existing displays are expensive and difficult to adapt. Tongueduino is an inexpensive, vinyl-cut tongue display designed to interface with many types of sensors besides cameras. Connected to a magnetometer, for example, the system provides a user with an internal sense of direction, like a migratory bird. Piezo whiskers allow a user to sense orientation, wind, and the lightest touch. Through tongueduino, we hope to bring electro-tactile sensory substitution beyond the discourse of vision replacement, towards open-ended sensory augmentation that anyone can access."

To sense pen + multi-touch interaction, we augment a Wacom Cintiq with a ZeroTouch multi-finger sensor. We used this modality to design new pen + touch interaction for play in real-time strategy eSports."

About sixty students, ages 12-14, participated in a 7.5-week study in which they created and programmed their own plush toys. In order to achieve these, they learned and used several tools, including LilyPad Arduino, Modkit and a web-based application called Plushbot, which permits the user to integrate circuitry design with a pattern of plush toy pieces. Once a design is complete, the user can print the pattern and use it as a template for creating a plush toy. Plushbot is a system that allows children to create their own interactive plush toys with computational elements and ideas embedded."

(1) Significantly more passers-by interact when immediately showing the mirrored user image (+90%) or silhouette (+47%) compared to a traditional attract sequence with call-to-action. (2) Passers-by often notice inter- activity late and have to walk back to interact (the landing effect).

The physical characteristics of each punch are captured using impact sensors and accelerometers, and LEDs, speakers and an associated display can be used to provide different prompts and responses. Interactions are logged over time for analysis. The bag was devised as a means of investigating how to design interactions in the context of a fun, physical, familiar object. Preliminary studies suggest that users are surprised and engaged, and that first-time users spend more time in their first encounter if the bag is running an &#8216;unexpected&#8217; program (e.g., giggling on impact rather than grunting). However, some users are sensitive about the nature of images and sounds associated with the bag, particularly where there is a conflict with social expectations or values. So far, the interactions that hold users&#8217; attention are those, like the musical &#8216;punching bag keyboard&#8217;, that combine moderate physical activity with a creative element or an intellectual challenge."

We designed the Haptic Lotus, a novel device that changes its form in response to the audience&#8217;s journey through the dark. The device was deliberately designed to be suggestive rather than directive to encourage enactive exploration for both sighted and blind people. During a week of public performances in Battersea Arts Centre in London 150 sighted and blind people took part.

  "Abstract": "This study investigated the effect of body-based information (proprioception, etc.) when participants navigated large-scale virtual marketplaces that were either small (Experiment 1) or large in extent (Experiment 2). Extent refers to the size of an environment, whereas scale refers to whether people have to travel through an environment to see the detail necessary for navigation. Each participant was provided with full body-based information (walking through the virtual marketplaces in a large tracking hall or on an omni-directional treadmill), just the translational component of body-based information (walking on a linear treadmill, but turning with a joystick), just the rotational component (physically turning but using a joystick to translate) or no body-based information (joysticks to translate and rotate). In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants&#8217; cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants&#8217; navigational performance. The experiments show that locomotion devices such as linear treadmills would bring substantial benefits to virtual environment applications where large spaces are navigated, and theories of human navigation need to reconsider the contribution made by body-based information, and distinguish between environmental scale and extent."

This paper investigates suitable real-world mappings of foot gestures to invoke commands and interact with virtual workspaces. Our first study identified user preferences for mapping common mobile-device commands to gestures. We distinguish these gestures in terms of discrete and continuous command input. While discrete foot-based input has relatively few parameters to control, continuous input requires careful design considerations on how the user's input can be mapped to a control parameter (e.g. the volume knob of the media player). We investigate this issue further through three user-studies. Our results show that rate-based techniques are significantly faster, more accurate and result if far fewer target crossings compared to displacement-based interaction. We discuss these findings and identify design recommendations."

To address this concern, we developed ShoeSense, a wearable system consisting in part of a shoe-mounted depth sensor pointing upward at the wearer. ShoeSense recognizes relaxed and discreet as well as large and demonstrative hand gestures. In particular, we designed three gesture sets (Triangle, Radial, and Finger-Count) for this setup, which can be performed without visual attention. The advantages of ShoeSense are illustrated in five scenarios. (1) quickly performing frequent operations without reaching for the phone, (2) discreetly performing operations without disturbing others, (3) enhancing operations on mobile devices, (4) supporting accessibility, and (5) artistic performances. We present a proof-of-concept, wearable implementation based on a depth camera and report on a lab study comparing social acceptability, physical and mental demand, and user preference. A second study demonstrates a 94-99% recognition rate of our recognizers."

  "Abstract": "In order to enable personalized functionality, such as to log tabletop activity by user, tabletop systems need to recognize users. DiamondTouch does so reliably, but requires users to stay in assigned seats and cannot recognize users across sessions. We propose a different approach based on distinguishing users&#65533; shoes. While users are interacting with the table, our system Bootstrapper observes their shoes using one or more depth cameras mounted to the edge of the table. It then identifies users by matching camera images with a database of known shoe images. When multiple users interact, Bootstrapper associates touches with shoes based on hand orientation. The approach can be implemented using consumer depth cameras because (1) shoes offer large distinct features such as color, (2) shoes naturally align themselves with the ground, giving the system a well-defined perspective and thus reduced ambiguity. We report two simple studies in which Bootstrapper recognized participants from a database of 18 users with 95.8% accuracy."

Using such temporal structures to convey information can be particularly useful in situations where the visual channel is overloaded or even not available. In this paper we introduce Rhythmic Interaction as the use of rhythms for input. We report the results of two experiments that show that (i) rhythmic patterns can be efficiently reproduced by novice users and recognized by computer algorithms, and (ii) rhythmic patterns can be memorized as efficiently as traditional shortcuts when associating them with visual commands. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of Rhythmic Interaction and open the way to a richer repertoire of interaction techniques."

The other presented the same metadata, but through additional auditory cues. We compared both techniques in a lab and real world study. Additional auditory cues were found to allow for smaller changes in metadata to be more accurately detected, but were least preferred when PULSE was used in context. Results also showed that PULSE enhanced and shaped user understanding, with audio presentation allowing a closer coupling of digital data to the physical world."

This paper applies McCarthy and Wright&#8217;s experiential framework to analyze these kinds of technology-mediated coincidences. By focusing upon encounters of coincidence during people&#8217;s digital music listening, we identified the elements at play, elucidated the properties of the individual elements, their inter-relationships, and an understanding of how coincidences can arise. We also reveal how under particular conditions, such elements provide people with opportunities to encounter coincidence. This understanding of coincidence demonstrates how McCarthy and Wright&#8217;s framework can be usefully applied to an empirical investigation of user experience."

The musical tunes can be modulated by our numerical acoustic simulator to create believable acoustic effects generated due to cavity in instruments such as drums. It further allows the users to change the materials, shapes, and sizes of the instruments, thereby offering the capability for both rapid prototyping and active exploration of sound effects by altering various physical parameters.

Our sample contains 310 histories with up to six years duration and 48 associated variables describing various user and music characteristics. Using a principal components analysis, we aggregated these variables into 13 components and found several correlations between them. The analysis especially showed the impact of seasons and a listener's interest in novelty on music choice. Using this information, a sample of a user's listening history or even just demographical data could be used to create personalized interfaces and novel recommendation strategies. We close with derived design considerations for future music interfaces."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington", "IBM"],
  "Abstract": "Questions of human values often arise in HCI research and practice. Such questions can be difficult to address well, and a principled approach can clarify issues of both theory and practice. One such approach is Value Sensitive Design (VSD), an established theory and method for addressing issues of values in a systematic and principled fashion in the design of information technology. In this essay, we suggest however that the theory and at times the presentation of VSD overclaims in a number of key respects, with the result of inhibiting its more widespread adoption and appropriation. We address these issues by suggesting four topics for next steps in the evolution of VSD. (1) tempering VSD&#65533;s position on universal values; (2) contextualizing existing and future lists of values that are presented as heuristics for consideration; (3) strengthening the voice of the participants in publications describing VSD investigations; and (4) making clearer the voice of the researchers. We propose new or altered approaches for VSD that address these issues of theory, voice, and reportage."

AR has evolved over the last several decades and offers HCI researchers theoretical lenses, methodological approaches, and pragmatic guidance for conducting socially relevant, collaborative, and engaged research. In this article, I describe the historical context and origins of AR, the scientifically rigorous practice of conducting and evaluating AR projects, and the ways in which AR might meaningfully be applied to HCI research."

  "Abstract": "Learning to read in a second language is challenging, but highly rewarding. For low-income children in developing countries, this task can be significantly more challenging because of lack of access to high-quality schooling, but can potentially improve economic prospects at the same time. A synthesis of research findings suggests that practicing recalling and vocalizing words for expressing an intended meaning could improve word reading skills &#8211; including reading in a second language &#8211; more than silent recognition of what the given words mean. Unfortunately, many language learning software do not support this instructional approach, owing to the technical challenges of incorporating speech recognition support to check that the learner is vocalizing the correct word. In this paper, we present results from a usability test and two subsequent experiments that explore the use of two speech recognition-enabled mobile games to help rural children in India read words with understanding. Through a working speech recognition prototype, we discuss two major contributions of this work. first, we give empirical evidence that shows the extent to which productive training (i.e. vocalizing words) is superior to receptive vocabulary training, and discuss the use of scaffolding hints to \"unpack\" factors in the learner&#8217;s linguistic knowledge that may impact reading. Second, we discuss what our results suggest for future research in HCI."

The interface was realized into a working system and evaluated against a traditional web interface for both high literacy (HL) and LL users. The suitability of the designs was analyzed using performance data, subjective feedback and an observational analysis. The findings from the study suggest that LL users perform better and prefer the proposed designs over a traditional web interface."

  "Abstract": "Efforts to address the problems of literacy are often focused on developing countries. However, functional illiteracy is a challenge encountered by up to 50% of adults in developed countries. In this paper we reflect on the challenges we faced in trying to design and study the use of a mobile application to support adult literacy with two user groups. adults enrolled in literacy classes and carpenters without a high school education enrolled in an essential skills program. We also elaborate on aspects of the evaluations that are specific to a marginalized, functionally illiterate, group in a developed country &#8211; aspects that are less frequently present in similar studies of mobile literacy support technologies in developing countries. We conclude with presenting the lessons learnt from our evaluations and the impact of the studies' specific challenges on the outcome and uptake of such mobile assistive technologies in providing practical support to low-literacy adults in conjunction with literacy and essential skills training."

  "Abstract": "This paper presents textual tinkerability, a new concept for fostering early literacy skills during parent-child reading. Textual tinkerability maps storytelling gestures to changes in animation and text to assist reading exploration and demonstration of the link between text, spoken word, and concept. TinkRBooks are flexible tablet-based storybooks that allow readers to actively explore concepts in text using textual tinkerability. When reading TinkRBooks, both parents and children can alter text (character attributes and parts of speech) by manipulating story elements (props and characters) as they read. We demonstrate how textual tinkerability encourages more dialog, print referencing and dialogic questioning between parent-child dyads in shared reading as compared to paper books. In addition, our study reports observations of storytelling performance behaviors that foster playful and socially intimate shared reading behaviors that are closely mapped to the teaching and learning of emergent literacy skills."

  "Abstract": "This paper reports findings from a series of participatory design workshops with ten people over eighty years old. The focus of the workshops was new banking technologies for the older old. Participants were asked to discuss their current experiences of banking and given packs of concept cards which contained design sketches and brief outlines of concepts for new financial services. The designs on the cards were deliberately provocative and aimed to encourage criticism and debate. Participants wrote and drew on the cards and the workshops were recorded and transcribed. The participants were extremely critical of current banking practices and most of the new concepts we presented to them. Their questions and comments led to a number of insights and further iterations. The paper argues that critique is an essential resource for design, both in terms of identifying problems and iterating ideas."

  "Authors": ["Stephen Uzor", "Lynne Baillie", "Dawn Skelton"],
  "Affiliations": ["Glasgow Caledonian University", "School of Health"],
  "Abstract": "Studies have shown that functional strength and balance exercises can reduce the risk of falling in older people if they are done on a regular basis. However, the repetitive nature of these exercises; as well as the use of instructional booklets and videos for rehabilitation may discourage seniors to exercise in the home, thereby rendering such an intervention ineffective. Our work proposed that the use of multimodal games &#65533; co-designed with seniors &#65533; could be a way of making falls rehabilitation more enjoyable; thereby improving adherence to home exercise programmes. In this paper, we first explain the process by which we identified barriers to the users&#65533; effective interaction with current home rehabilitation tools. We then go on to describe how we actively involved seniors in the initial design, and improvement of useful, enjoyable games for falls rehabilitation. Our findings suggest that seniors are an integral part of the design process and should be directly involved from the concept stages of the design of tools for their rehabilitation."

Many older people find cheques valuable as a means of payment but the UK Payments Council recently proposed their abolition. We describe two designs that simultaneously aimed to preserve and augment the paper cheque as a means of making electronic payments. These were devised during participatory design workshops through critical dialogues with our eighty something participants. Workshop discussions resulted in the creation of a real world cheque system where we issued pre-paid cheques without the involvement of banks. This work informed the development of a digital cheque book based on Anoto digital pen technology. The work illustrates the value of participatory design with &#65533;extraordinary&#65533; users, such as the eighty somethings, in HCI."

We suggest participatory design as an approach to improving the quality of design for older people but, based on previous work and our own experiences, identify four central issues that participatory design approaches need to address. We describe an approach to early engagement in design with older people that address each of these issues and some of our experiences applying the approach in a variety of different design projects. We conclude by discussing some of the issues that have been highlighted when attempting apply this approach in different design contexts and the issues that have been raised when working with partners who are less committed to the idea of engaging with older adults in participatory design."

  "Abstract": "Although predictive human performance modeling has been researched for 30 years in HCI, to our knowledge modeling has been conducted as a solitary task of one modeler or, occasionally, two modelers working in tight face-to-face collaboration. In contrast, we used predictive human performance modeling in a collaborative, distributed mode and reflect on that experience. We discovered that our tool for modeling, CogTool, while sufficiently functional and expressive to perform the modeling task, did not support collaborative, distributed modeling as well as we would like. We suggest process improvements in model construction, the management of assumptions, consistency, and communication, and suggest design solutions for the future of CogTool or other modeling tools. We further speculate on the generalization of our experiences to other types of usability evaluation when conducted in a distributed, collaborative environment."

In this paper, we present an empirical study of a representative aggregate judgment task. finding regions of maximum average in a series. We show how a theory of perceptual averaging suggests a visual design other than the typically-used line graph. We describe an experiment that assesses participants' ability to estimate averages and make judgments based on these averages. The experiment confirms that this color encoding significantly outperforms the standard practice. The experiment also provides evidence for a perceptual averaging theory."

  "Abstract": "CHI researchers typically use a significance testing approach to statistical analysis when testing hypotheses during usability evaluations. However, the appropriateness of this approach is under increasing criticism, with statisticians, economists, and psychologists arguing against the use of routine interpretation of results using 'canned' p values. Three problems with current practice - the fallacy of the transposed conditional, a neglect of power, and the reluctance to interpret the size of effects - can lead us to build weak theories based on vaguely specified hypothesis, resulting in empirical studies which produce results that are of limited practical or scientific use. Using publicly available data presented at CHI 2010 [19] as an example we address each of the three concerns and promote consideration of the magnitude and actual importance of effects, as opposed to statistical significance, as the new criteria for evaluating CHI research."

  "Authors": ["Guenter Wallner", "Simone Kriglstein"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Applied Arts Vienna", "University of Vienna"],
  "Abstract": "Contemporary video games are highly complex systems with many interacting variables. To make sure that a game provides a satisfying experience, a meaningful analysis of gameplay data is crucial, particularly because the quality of a game directly relates to the experience a user gains from playing it. Automatic instrumentation techniques are increasingly used to record data during playtests. However, the evaluation of the data requires strong analytical skills and experience. The visualization of such gameplay data is essentially an information visualization problem, where a large number of variables have to be displayed in a comprehensible way in order to be able to make global judgments. This paper presents a visualization tool to assist the analytical process. It visualizes the game space as a set of nodes which players visit over the course of a game and is also suitable to observe time-dependent information, such as player distribution. Our tool is not tailored to a specific type of genre. To show the flexibility of our approach we use two different kinds of games as case studies."

  "Type": "Paper",

  "Authors": ["Erin Friess"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of North Texas"],
  "Abstract": "Personas have become a well-lauded method to aid designers in keeping the needs of the intended user population at the forefront of the design process. However, few studies have ethnographically observed design teams that use personas, and fewer studies have looked specifically at how designers linguistically invoke personas in their decision-making sessions. This discourse analysis of the decision-making sessions of designers at a top tier design firm reveals that although the designers dedicate much time researching, developing, and refining personas, personas themselves make relatively few appearances in the designers&#65533; language during decision-making sessions. This study shows that, for persuasive ends, these designers, who are advocates of personas, routinely use other less precise and more designer-centric linguistic mechanisms in lieu of personas. Despite the scarcity of personas in the decision-making sessions, this ethnographic case study also explores the value of personas for this team even when the personas are not explicitly linguistically invoked."

  "Abstract": "Personas are a critical method for orienting design and development teams to user experience. Prior work has noted challenges in justifying them to developers. In contrast, it has been assumed that designers and user experience professionals--whose goal is to focus designs on targeted users--will readily exploit personas. This paper examines that assumption. We present the first study of how experienced user-centered design (UCD) practitioners with prior experience deploying personas, use and perceive personas in industrial software design. We identify limits to the persona approach in the context studied. Practitioners used personas almost exclusively for communication, but not for design. Participants identified four problems with personas, finding them abstract, impersonal, misleading and distracting. Our findings argue for a new approach to persona deployment and construction. Personas cannot replace immersion in actual user data. And rather than focusing on creating engaging personas, it is critical to avoid persona attributes that mislead or distract."

Assessing their requirements is challenging, as it requires sensitivity in terms of choosing an appropriate approach to collect data. Furthermore, the illustration of the data for the subsequent design process can be difficult, if different partners are involved in a project. In order to overcome these difficulties, we are exploring a decision diagram for the creation of personas. It aims at identifying the most appropriate approach (i.e. qualitative and/or quantitative data collection), taking into account the characteristics of the special user groups among other aspects. In this case study we present how we applied the decision diagram in three different projects to create personas for elderly and children."

Static step-by-step tutorials are easy to scan but hard to create and don't always give all of the necessary information for how to accomplish a step. In contrast, video tutorials provide very detailed information and are easy to create, but they are hard to scan as the video-player timeline does not give an overview of the entire task. We present MixT, which automatically generates mixed media tutorials that combine the strengths of these tutorial types. MixT tutorials include step-by-step text descriptions and images that are easy to scan and short videos for each step that provide additional context and detail as needed. We ground our design in a formative study that shows that mixed-media tutorials outperform both static and video tutorials."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Geneva", "University of Geneva, Geneva, Geneva"],
  "Abstract": "Many people with visual disabilities mainly use audio feedback as a primary modality for interaction. Representing the visual environment with appropriate sounds contributes to make it intelligible to the blind. This audio-encoded environment still needs to be accessed in the same way as sighted people scan visual contents with their gaze. A finger-based scanning could be seen as a gaze-like strategy for those with visual impairments to be able of sensing an audio-represented context. We present in this work a computational interface that meets both, the visual-audio codification and the multi-touch interaction, so as to enlarge legibility of the environment for the blind and to facilitate navigating to desired locations, exploration, and serendipitous discovery. The core of this interface is the color and depth codification into musical instruments sounds, which effectively provides spatial awareness, audio revealing of boundaries and obstacles detection. The main contribution of our work is the assistance provided by this interface toward an active interaction of the user with his fingers that makes it possible to selectively explore, to discover points of interest, develop personalized strategies for navigating, and, in general, enjoy a greater sense of independence."

SparkInfo is designed for a group of people, who have created audiovisual elements for the same purpose or at the same event, to collect their elements in one place and have a meaningful experience of their co-created media resources. SparkInfo provides a social space for the co-creation of audiovisual and multimedia resources. In the process of exploring and embellishing their materials, SparkInfo users can create new ideas, stories, and information.

To this end, we identified user needs and variables with blind participants, designed and evaluated prototype systems, and iteratively improved the system. The overall process, findings, and on-going future works are discussed. This effort is expected to enhance independence for persons who are blind."

  "Abstract": "Since smart phones adopted touchscreen, users have been enjoying large displays. However, when using soft keyboard, the available size of the display becomes less than 50%. In this paper Back Keyboard, a physical keyboard installed backside of mobile phone, is presented. Also the design process with a prototype through a series of studies is described. User evaluation was conducted with the prototype; the average text entry rate was 15.3 WPM (SD. 3.6) and the error rate was 12.2% (SD. 9.0) after a 40-minute typing session. Moreover, the text entry rates of Back Keyboard and general keyboards for PCs did not have significant relations. This means that the prototype could be used smoothly regardless of one&#8217;s ability of typing on a PC."

  "Abstract": "This study explored whether cues from others in a purchase environment have an effect on purchase behavior for products with fair-trade labels, an ethical attribute of products, among Japanese consumers. By manipulating cues from others, we assessed consumers&#8217; intentions to purchase fair-trade products under three different experimental situations. 1) the observed condition, in which participants&#8217; purchasing behaviors were observed by others (N = 84), 2) the agent condition, in which participants&#8217; purchasing behaviors were observed by a clerk-like agent (N = 118), and 3) the non-observed condition, in which participants&#8217; purchasing behaviors could not be observed by others (N = 106). The results of this conjoint experiment demonstrate that participants under both the agent and observed conditions valuated fair-trade products higher than those under the non-observed condition, although participants both in the agent and the non-observed conditions were instructed that their responses would remain anonymous. These findings imply that implications of the presence of others, such as a clerk-like agent in an unmanned purchase environment, enhance ethical purchasing behaviors as with manned purchase environments."

  "Abstract": "Creativity supports societal and economic prosperity. As such, HCI researchers have been concerned with creating technologies to support creativity. Crowdfunding offers a new type of creativity support tool where creators rely on the crowd to collect, create, relate, and donate creative work. With the rapid growth of crowdfunding platforms, design principles are needed to guide platform development. This paper presents design principles informed by Shneiderman&#8217;s Genex Framework for creativity support tools in order for designers to answer the call from Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to empower more people to be more creative."

  "Abstract": "In the 21st century knowledge economy there is a growing need for the types of creative thinkers who can bridge the engineering mindset with the creative mindset, combining multiple types of skills. New economies will need workers who have 'diagonal' skill sets, who can develop systems and content as an integrative process. This requires a new type of training and curriculum. In the newly formed 'Digital Culture' undergraduate program at ASU, we attempt to support new types curricula by structuring differently the way students move through courses. With a constantly shifting and changing curriculum, structuring course enrollment using class \"prerequisites\" leads to fixed and rigid pathways through the curriculum. Instead, Digital Culture structures course sequences based on the students accumulation of abstract 'Proficiencies' which are collected by students as they complete courses, and which act as keys to unlock access to higher level course. As a student accumulates more and more of these proficiencies, they are increasingly able to unlock new courses. This system leads to more flexible and adaptive pathways through courses while ensuring that students are prepared for entrance into more advanced classes. It is however more complicated and requires that students strategically plan their route through the curriculum. In order to support this kind of strategic planning we have designed and deployed a course planning system where students can simulate various possible paths through the curriculum. In this paper, we show our design process in coming up with our 'Digital Culture Visual Planner'. This design process starts with a network analysis of how all the Digital Culture courses are interrelated by, visualizing the relationships between \"proficiencies\" and courses. A number of possible design directions result from this analysis. Finally we select a single design and refine it to be understandable, useful and usable by new undergraduate Digital Culture majors."

  "Abstract": "Phishing is a severe threat to online users, especially since attackers improve in impersonating other websites. With websites looking visually the same, users are fooled more easily. However, the close visual similarity can also be used to counteract phishing. We present a framework that uses visual website similarity. (1) to detect possible phishing websites and (2) to create better warnings for such attacks. We report first results together with the three step process planned for the project. We expect the detection results to be comparable to previously published work which would allow for new kinds of phishing warnings with better coverage, less false positives and explicit user recommendations how to avoid these critical situation."

  "Affiliations": ["Stanford University"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper we identify 10 design heuristics used to minimize the number of stressors in an interface. They are meant to complement other interface design heuristics. The heuristics are based on characteristics of stressors drawn from decades of empirical study. These include both evolutionary (survival) and psychosocial sources of stressors. The list is followed by the results of an exploratory heuristic evaluation conducted on four different mobile Twitter clients. It shows how the heuristics complement Nielsen&#8217;s usability heuristics by enabling designers to evaluate and differentiate interfaces along two dimensions. usability and potential for stress. The results of the paper are useful for designers and scholars interested in systems that induce, or mitigate the risk of inducing, negative psychophysiological state change. Current methods of evaluating interfaces on this dimension require user interviews and physiological monitoring."

In general modeling software, parts of a complex 3D object are grouped in a multi-level hierarchy for efficient operation and ungrouping is necessary for observing or manipulating a part in detail. Our method uses real-world bond metaphors (such as glue or a joint) to prevent incorrect operations and improve the system&#8217;s operational feeling and responsiveness. This paper presents the details of our proposed method and an informal user study."

The main features of Knoby include i) emotional expression of welcoming through its tail movement, ii) locking and unlocking interface similar to people&#8217;s interaction with a dog, and iii) continuous dynamic interaction for long term product attachment. Preliminary evaluation has showed that users perceive Knoby to be alive and to support emotional and playful interaction. This research provides a new perspective on the development of complex and intelligent products, and this model can be used as a design method for considering different pets and associated characteristics."

In this work-in-progress, we present a platform necessary for doing such large-scale machine learning on Web designs, which consists of a Web crawler and proxy server to harvest and store a lossless and immutable snapshot of the Web; a page segmenter that codifies a page&#8217;s visual layout; and an interface for augmenting the segmentations with crowdsourced metadata."

  "Abstract": "Trust has been shown to be a major antecedent of technology acceptance and usage. Consequently, behavioral research has created vast insights on trust building. However, only a small fraction of the existing literature also shows ways of systematically including these insights into system design. Hence, the potential of most behavioral insights on trust for developing new systems often remains only partly realized. To alleviate this problem, we present a way to systematically derive trust-supporting design elements using trust theory. Using a laboratory experiment, we show that the trust-related design elements derived from theory are regarded as being important by the participants, and significantly increased their trust in a restaurant recommendation system as well as in their intention to use it in the future."

We provide an example of such an SMI in the form of a prototype of a vacuum cleaner. The prototype uses schematic electrochromic polymer at the suction nozzle of the vacuum cleaner, which changes its color depending on the dust level on a floor. We emphasize on the new affordances and communication language supported by SMIs, which challenges the current metaphors of user interfaces in the field of HCI."

As part of the evaluation we also consider how to alter the size of the interaction space to best suit the number of digits being used. By identifying which digits can accurately apply force both individually and in combination with others, we can then design one-handed, multi-channel input for mobile interaction. The results suggest that not all digits are equally accurate, and that some are more accurate when used in combination with others. Further, increasing the size of the underlying interaction space to suit the number of digits used improves user performance."

  "Affiliations": ["University College London"],
  "Abstract": "In the English language, the letters of the alphabet do not occur with equal frequency. Some letters occur far more often than others, for example the letter &#8216;e&#8217; occurs more frequently than &#8216;z&#8217;. In this paper we show that as with letters, digits too suffer from unequal distributions in some situations. Here we show that the most common digits being used when programming infusion pumps to administer drugs to patients are 0, 1, 2 and 5. The digit 9 is also frequently used to set an infusion to run at the maximum rate possible. With this information, we evaluate three current forms of infusion pump input with regards to the digits that are actually being programmed into the machines. We argue that the current number interface designs used in medical devices should take into account these findings in order to produce interfaces that are both more suitable for the task, and less error prone in use."

  "Abstract": "We present research that investigates the amount of guidance required by users for precise back-of-device interaction. We explore how pointing effectiveness is influenced by the presence or absence of visual guidance feedback. Participants were asked to select targets displayed on an iPad device, by touching and releasing them from underneath the device. Another iPad was used to detect finger positions from the rear. Results showed that participants were able to select targets as accurately without visual feedback of finger position as they were with it. Additionally, no significant increase in workload was identified when visual feedback was removed. Our results show that users do not require complex techniques to visualize finger position on the rear of device. Visual feedback does not affect any performance parameters, such as effectiveness, perceived performance, and the number of trials needed to select a target. We also outline the implications of our findings and our future work to fully investigate the effect of visual guidance feedback."

  "Abstract": "Speech reminders can severely disrupt list recall. Spearcons, time-compressed speech messages, might be less disruptive because they are much shorter. In this study, we asked 24 younger participants to recall 64 short lists of digit, animal, food, or furniture names. List items were presented one at a time; the number of items presented depended on individual digit spans. Spearcons affected list recall to the same extent as speech. However, people with higher digit spans had significantly worse recall. This could be due to short-term memory overload or the longer presentation time of long lists. We discuss implications for menu design."

However, their model was based on a specific circular target condition, without the ability to predict the performance of acquiring conventional rectangular targets. In this paper, we extend their one-dimensional model to two-dimensional (2D) target conditions. Carrying out an experiment, we evaluate the abilities of different model candidates to find out the most appropriate one. The new index of difficulty we redefine for 2D eye pointing (IDeye) can properly reflect the asymmetrical impact of target width and height, and consequently the IDeye model can accurately predict the performance for 2D targets (R2 > 0.9). According to the results of our study, the new model can provide more useful design implications for gaze-based interactions."

  "Abstract": "Human multitasking is often the result of self-initiated interruptions in the performance of an ongoing task. Compared to externally induced interruptions, self-interruptions have not received enough research attention. To address this gap, this paper develops a detailed classification of self-interruptions rooted in positive and negative feelings of task progress based on responses subjects provided after completing a multitasking laboratory experiment. The results suggest that multitasking due to negative feelings is associated with more self-interruptions than those triggered by positive feelings and that more self-interruptions may produce lower accuracy in all tasks. Therefore, negative internal triggers of self-interruptions seem to unleash a downward spiral that ultimately affects performance."

However, user experience of air travel is often marked by frustration, stress and confusion. Indeed, over the last decade, traveler satisfaction with air travel experiences has steadily declined. This paper describes fieldwork in the form of 63 interviews (using a range of user research methods) that aims to understand the needs of air travelers. Key insights from this process are presented and a conceptual system design, based on connecting travelers using existing social media systems, is introduced. Ultimately, this paper argues that applying innovation in social media technology to air travel has the potential to improve user experiences and reduce industry costs, making travelling smoother, cheaper and more satisfying."

This paper presents a system which tackles these problems as it can identify users and keeps track of their actions around interactive tabletops. To start the user identification, a user puts their personal device onto the interactive surface. Once this is paired with the tabletop, linking the device owner's identity to the table, the system continuously tracks any touch by that user. The system seamlessly and continuously associates each user touch with an identity."

  "Abstract": "Along with the smart phone came smart phone applications, which range in functionality, complexity and price. Hugely popular are lifestyle applications which include tools for diet and exercise. Despite the popularity of these applications however, we have yet to see any form of rigorous investigation into their value, i.e. their impact on user behaviour and long term health goals. We embarked on a live clinical trial of a behavior based mobile application designed to assist users on meal replacement diet programs to judge its impact and value. Our analysis showed that users were more engaged with a fully interactive application than an information based application, and that varying analysis conditions seemed to result in varying impact."

  "Abstract": "Today&#8217;s in-car information systems are undergoing an evolution towards device miniaturization as well as to real-time telematics services. In a road study with 26 participants, we investigated whether small smartphone-sized screens are recommendable for the communication of realtime safety services. We did not find strong overall differences between large and small screen setups in any of our investigated measures. However, when no audio was presented, safety services presentation on small screens resulted in significantly more long glances to the HMI than on large screen. Also, subjective comprehensibility of driving recommendations was best when screen size was large and audio presentation was available. Implications and further research opportunities are discussed."

  "Abstract": "The shift in HCI towards emotions, values, needs etc., (third-wave HCI) reflects the new understanding of interactions between users and technology. However, the focus on usability in the first-wave slightly got out of sight in the second-wave, which mainly addressed the user in working environments, and even more in the third-wave HCI. This wave holds a focus on emotions, experiences and values, not only at work but also during leisure time. We have identified a lack of suitable frameworks and concepts, which provide an integrated view on values on the one hand and usability, user experience and user acceptance on the other hand. For evaluating a prototype in an Ambient Assisted Living project we developed an approach for combining value- and user-centered design with factors related to usability, user experience and user acceptance."

  "Abstract": "We present a user study involving 80 participants in 40 pairs about the implications of four time-space conditions in a collaborative information seeking task, namely. co-located, remotely located with text chat, remotely located with audio chat, and asynchronous. Results suggest that when individuals are co-located, their search behaviors tend to overlap thus affecting their ability to find diverse and useful information. On the other hand, when people are remotely located, the levels of independency and diversity depend upon the richness of the communication channel being used. Finally, when collaborative search is performed asynchronously, team members reach high levels of independency at the cost of effectiveness. These findings are particularly essential in various areas of research and application such as human-computer interaction (HCI) and information retrieval (IR), providing additional knowledge that would enable system designers to provide better support for the information search process of teams."

This paper outlines the first of a series of studies on User Engagement (UE), a subset of UX, which focuses upon the quality of the within session interactive experience. The aim of this study is to explore affect through the responses to interactive features and how this impacts upon user judgment. Initial findings indicate that websites with more interactive features generate enhanced positive affect within session, which may predominate over a longer term, thus impacting on the overall user experience."

  "Abstract": "In tabletop computing it is crucial to instantiate objects, such as documents or virtual containers, in an ergonomically convenient way for users. Particularly, objects need to be positioned within reach of users, need to be orientated properly, and need to be scaled appropriately for convenient interaction by touch. As the user&#8217;s location at the device is usually unknown to the system, objects are typically spawned at a default position and with a default orientation and size in tabletop user interfaces. Thus, users typically need to manipulate objects after instantiation until they are properly aligned and scaled, which can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. We designed two gesture-based interaction techniques to instantiate objects with a convenient orientation, size, and position, making further adjustments to these properties unnecessary. We describe the functionality of both techniques and discuss insights gathered during initial evaluations."

This is achieved by filtering and analyzing the acoustic signal generated when the tip of the pen is rubbed on the touchscreen. The advantage of this approach is that it is inexpensive, reliable and suitable for mobile interaction because it does not require mechanical parts to sense the input pressure. Results from a user study shows that the participants recognized five out of ten different pressure levels with perfect accuracy, and nine out of ten with minimal error."

  "Abstract": "Lab-based testing is one of the key methods employed for evaluating web site usability. Yet the artificial conditions of the setting, including surveillance and stylized tasks, can distort user behavior and limit the data that can be obtained. This paper reports on the effectiveness of this standard method compared against two complementary methods which involve more natural, user-driven evaluation contexts, namely, pre-session homework assignments and online usability testing. Using illustrations from recent studies of online shopping sites we detail the advantages and limitations of each method and claim that employing them in combination could improve the quantity and quality of findings. We then propose that future work should focus on optimizing this combined method through sequencing, so that one evaluation approach would inform the design of subsequently used ones."

We also describe the functional deformable research prototype (called Kinetic DUI-RP) that we are using to conduct our research.

A new F-formation specific to this domain is identified and used to suggest design opportunities for a digitally enhanced kitchen space for sharing the social experience of \"cooking together\" for people living in different homes."

In a qualitative exploration with Finnish children aged 10-13 years, we identified practices of making digital music meaningful. socially considerate sharing, modification and associations outside music, and consideration for the difficulties of infrastructure. We find that the content gains value in the socio-technical network of sharing practices. This observation challenges the notions of digital music as a \"mass\" format lacking personal or social value."

A framework was deployed based on Microsoft Kinect using OpenNI and Unity to animate in real-time a silhouette. This was used to perform a set of experiments related to the user&#8217;s interaction with human and non-human like puppets. We believe that a performance-driven silhouette can be just as expressive as a traditional shadow puppet with a high degree of freedom, making use of our entire body as an input. We describe our solution that allows real-time interactive control of virtual shadow puppets for performance animation based on body motion. We show through our experiment, performed by non-expert artists, that using our body to control puppets is like mixing the performance of an actor with the manipulation of a puppeteer."

Continuous recognition allows the system to provide visual feedback to the user and to anticipate user commands to possibly decrease perceived response time. To achieve this goal we employ two Hidden Markov Model (HMM) systems, one for recognition and another for generating visual feedback. We analyze a set of geometric features used in other gesture recognition systems and determine a subset that works best for HMMs. Finally we demonstrate the practicality of our recognition HMMs in a proof of concept mobile application for Google&#8217;s Android mobile platform that has a recognition accuracy rate of 96% over 15 distinct gestures."

Plain technology (e.g., SOAP/WSDL web services) or simple modeling languages (e.g., Yahoo! Pipes) don't convey enough meaning to non-programmers. In this paper, we propose a domain-specific approach to mashups that speaks the language of the user', i.e., that is aware of the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is comfortable with. We exemplify the approach by implementing a mashup tool for a specific domain (research evaluation) and describe the respective user study. The results of a first user study confirm that domain-specific mashup tools indeed lower the entry barrier to mashup development."

While there is now abundant technological support for reading and interpreting literary text in new ways through text-processing algorithms, the other parts of the cycle -- exploration and understanding -- have been relatively neglected. Motivated by the literature on sensemaking, we are developing a software system that integrates tools for algorithmic processing of text with interaction techniques that support the interpretive, exploratory, and note-taking aspects of scholarship. At present, our project supports grammatical search and contextual similarity determination, visualization of patterns of word context, and examination and organization of the source material for comparison and hypothesis-building. This article illustrates its capabilities by analyzing language-use differences between male and female characters in Shakespeare's plays. We find that when love is a major plot point, the language Shakespeare uses to refer to women becomes more physical, and the language referring to men becomes more sentimental. Future work will incorporate additional sensemaking tools to aid comparison, exploration, grouping, and pattern recognition."

We analyzed 122 individual items on theories collected in a CHI&#8217;11 special interest group session on UX theories and theoretical frameworks. The data set was filtered and categorized in several iterations, resulting in 56 items distributed over 7 major theory categories and related to 9 relevant disciplines. The categories are an initial mapping of the field and point towards the directions for further conceptual and theoretical clarification.

This research takes the Kinect into real-life kitchens, where touchless gestural control could be a boon for messy hands, but where commands are interspersed with the movements of cooking. We implement a recipe navigator, timer and music player and, experimentally, allow users to change the control scheme at runtime and navigate with other limbs when their hands are full. We tested our system with five subjects who baked a cookie recipe in their own kitchens, and found that placing the Kinect was simple and that subjects felt successful. However, testing in real kitchens underscored the challenge of preventing accidental commands in tasks with sporadic input."

  "Abstract": "Rapid growth in the usage of location-aware mobile phones has enabled Location Sharing Services (LSS) to gain mainstream adoption. Integration with social networking services has further accelerated LSS usage. We conducted an online study (N = 401) to uncover the impact of recent changes in the underlying social and technological landscape on the preferences and practices of LSS users in the US. We found that the main motivations for location sharing were to connect with one's social circle, to project an interesting image of oneself, and to receive rewards offered for 'checking in.' Respondents overwhelmingly preferred sharing location only upon explicit action. More than 25% of the respondents recalled at least one instance of regret over having shared location. These findings highlight the tension between the utility of location sharing and concerns with invasions of privacy. Empowering users to resolve this tension effectively can potentially drive further growth in adoption and utility of LSS."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Maryland Baltimore County"],
  "Abstract": "This paper explores the relationship between emotion and the notification experience. We found a strong relationship between the user emotions used to describe interruptive notification experiences and whether the users wanted similar interruptive notifications again in the future. Participants were likely to want similar future interruptive notifications if they described their interruptive notification experiences using positive words. They were likely to not want similar future interruptive notifications if they described their interruptive notification experiences using negative words. The implications for the use of this knowledge in the design of intelligent systems and potential for future work are also discussed."

  "Abstract": "Sound exists only in the moment, and cannot be referenced or searched, except in the mutable memories of people. Because of this, it has been an overlooked modality and social information channel, particularly where nonverbal communication cues and identity are concerned. Yet, it encapsulates a person&#8217;s identity as effectively as a fingerprint or signature. Sound is even more useful when combined with other modalities, like the visual and gestural. In order to use the modality of sound effectively, however, we need tools that simultaneously analyze, persist, and present the important information in sound. What if you could capture identity and meaning in sound, and give it additional affordances, that go beyond those of written communication? In this paper, we explore the voice as identity and as the carrier of nonverbal information in the context of a sonic guest book."

To this end, we propose a series of applications that leverage the affordances of this technology."

We also explored measures of empathy (a key concept for &#8216;walking in end-user&#8217;s shoes&#8217;) among HCI professionals. We found that there were distinct and significant differences among individuals who claimed user-centric job titles (e.g. usability engineer) from those who claimed design-centric job titles (e.g. interaction designer, developer). Differences included how job-title groups considered end-users in their work and their empathetic profiles. We used results from this pilot study to inform a more comprehensive study we are currently undertaking."

To facilitate exploration of this hypothesis, we propose Page Blossom an exemplar of such dynamic data interaction that is based on data reuse via our open data platform Webbox + Active (active knowledge technology) lenses"

  "Abstract": "Sketch recognition researchers have long concentrated their energies on investigating issues related to computer systems' difficulties in recognizing hand-drawn diagrams, but the focus has largely been on recognizing sketches on physical surfaces. While beyond-surface sketching actively takes place in diverse forms and in various activities, directly applying existing on-surface sketch recognition techniques beyond physical surfaces is far from trivial. In this paper, we investigate initial approaches for locating corners and extracting primitive geometric shapes in beyond-surface sketches, which are important ingredients of subsequent higher-level interpretations for building richer sketching interfaces. Moreover, we investigate preliminary challenges of sketch recognition in beyond-surface environments and discuss possible solutions for achieving successful next-step extensions of this work."

  "Abstract": "Visual telecommunication systems support natural interaction by allowing users to remotely interact with one another using natural speech and movement. Network connections and computation cause delays that may result in interactions that feel unnatural or belabored. In an experiment using an audiovisual telecommunications device, synchronized audio and video delays were added to participants' conversations to determine how delay would affect conversation. To examine the effects of visual information on conversation, we also compared the audiovisual trials to trials in which participants were presented only the audio information. We present self-report data indicating that delay had a weaker impact when both audio and video channels were available, for delays up to 500 ms, than when only the audio channel was available."

  "Affiliations": ["Swansea University", "University of Nottingham"],
  "Abstract": "Tag clouds are typically presented so that users can actively utilize community-generated metadata to query a collection. This research investigates whether such metadata representations also provide passive support for sensemaking without any direct interaction. Previous work reported potentially significant results from a pilot study of three variations of keyword cloud support (interactive, non-interactive, and absent), built from related query terms. Our full study, however, found no significant differences in learning across the three conditions. We concluded that the sensemaking and learning mainly occurred outside of the search engine, where the keyword cloud no longer provided support. Our future work will study the passive support that may be provided by keyword clouds in more integrated systems like digital libraries."

  "Authors": ["Seunghyun Woo", "Hyojin Suh", "Hosang Cheon"],
  "Affiliations": ["LG Electronics"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose reinforcement of spatial perception on stereoscopic 3D user interfaces. We design basic stereoscopic 3D components that can maximize reinforcement of spatial perception in user interfaces for mobile handsets. Prior works do not make sufficient use of the stereoscopic effect with autostereoscopic displays. We also investigate design methods that provide a comfortable 3D user interface on mobile handsets. Existing stereoscopic 3D technology focuses on entertainment value and emphasizes graphical effects. However, these 3D experiences require excessive parallax resulting in discomfort and visual fatigue. We propose basic design methods to reduce such negative effects. In this paper, we try to approach stereoscopic 3D not as a technology or a function, which was the case in previous examples, but as an additional spatial experience for the users, moving closely to the original meaning of 3D space."

  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Berkeley", "UC Berkeley"],
  "Abstract": "Online labor markets, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, have been used to crowdsource simple, short tasks like image labeling and transcription. However, expert knowledge is often lacking in such markets, making it impossible to complete certain classes of tasks. In this work we introduce an alternative mechanism for crowdsourcing tasks that require specialized knowledge or skill. communitysourcing --- the use of physical kiosks to elicit work from specific populations. We investigate the potential of communitysourcing by designing, implementing and evaluating Umati. the communitysourcing vending machine. Umati allows users to earn credits by performing tasks using a touchscreen attached to the machine. Physical rewards (in this case, snacks) are dispensed through traditional vending mechanics. We evaluated whether communitysourcing can accomplish expert work by using Umati to grade Computer Science exams. We placed Umati in a university Computer Science building, targeting students with grading tasks for snacks. Over one week, 328 unique users (302 of whom were students) completed 7771 tasks (7240 by students). 80% of users had never participated in a crowdsourcing market before. We found that Umati was able to grade exams with 2% higher accuracy (at the same price) or at 33% lower cost (at equivalent accuracy) than traditional single-expert grading. Mechanical Turk workers had no success grading the same exams. These results indicate that communitysourcing can successfully elicit high-quality expert work from specific communities."

  "Abstract": "Web-based technical support such as discussion forums and social networking sites have been successful at ensuring that most technical support questions eventually receive helpful answers. Unfortunately, finding these answers is still quite difficult, since users&#65533; textual queries are often incomplete, imprecise, or use different vocabularies to describe the same problem. We present LemonAid, a new approach to help that allows users to find help by instead selecting a label, widget, link, image or other user interface (UI) element that they believe is relevant to their problem. LemonAid uses this selection to retrieve previously asked questions and their corresponding answers. The key insight that makes LemonAid work is that users tend to make similar selections in the interface for similar help needs and different selections for different help needs. Our initial evaluation shows that across a corpus of dozens of tasks and thousands of requests, LemonAid retrieved a result for 90% of help requests based on UI selections and, of those, over half had relevant matches in the top 2 results."

We demonstrate that this approach can be used to select highlights specific for fans of each team, and that these clips reflect the emotions of a fan dur-ing a game. Further, we describe how these clips differ from those seen on nightly sportscasts."

  "Authors": ["Niels Henze"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Oldenburg"],
  "Abstract": "Mobile HCI studies are often conducted in a highly controlled environment and with a small convenient sample. Such common studies can have a high internal validity but often lack external validity. The findings cannot always be generalized to the behaviour of real users in real contexts. In contrast, researchers recently started to use apps as an apparatus for mobile HCI research. Publishing apps in mobile application stores enables to study large samples in their 'natural habitat'. We present the game Hit It! that has been installed 427,255 times and, more importantly, served as a tool to conduct a number of HCI studies. The amount of collected data enabled us to study users' touch behaviour, approaches to ask for consent, the best time to deploy games, and approaches for providing tactile feedback. We discuss advantages of the approach and argue that Hit It! enabled findings that would be impossible to obtain using traditional studies."

In particular, multiple players may freely combine and lock together their handheld game controllers, thereby creating a very flexible collective and transformable tangible interface. Combiform emphasizes social interaction through controller-to-controller contact. The platform and its 10 games introduce novel, tangible and physical co-attentive experiences that are not found in traditional co-located gaming platforms using &#8216;embodied&#8217; controllers (e.g. Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect). Based on observations, this new interactive technique has successfully transformed typical co-located social play experiences into a multisensory physical activity."

  "Abstract": "As user-generated Web content increases, the amount of inappropriate and/or objectionable content also grows. Several scholarly communities are addressing how to detect and manage such content. research in computer vision focuses on detection of inappropriate images, natural language processing technology has advanced to recognize insults. However, profanity detection systems remain flawed. Current list-based profanity detection systems have two limitations. First, they are easy to circumvent and easily become stale&#8211;that is, they cannot adapt to misspellings, abbreviations, and the fast pace of profane slang evolution. Secondly, they offer a one-size fits all solution; they typically do not accommodate domain, community and context specific needs. However, social settings have their own normative behaviors&#8211;what is deemed acceptable in one community may not be in another. In this paper, through analysis of comments from a social news site, we provide evidence that current systems are performing poorly and evaluate the cases on which they fail. We then address community differences regarding creation/tolerance of profanity and suggest a shift to more contextually nuanced profanity detection systems."

Our methodology consisted of conducting interviews with designers and developers from the Drupal and Ubuntu communities (N=17) and analyzing a large corpus of interaction data collected from Drupal. The interviews captured user perspectives on the challenges of reaching consensus, techniques employed for building consensus, and the consequences of not reaching consensus. We analyzed the interaction data to determine how different elements of the content, process, and user relationships in the design discussions affect consensus. Our main result shows that design discussions engaging participants with more experience and prior interaction history are more likely to reach consensus. Based on all of our results, we formulated design implications for promoting consensus in distributed discussions of user interface design issues."

To explore the role of social media in the discussion of mental health issues, and with particular reference to insomnia and sleep disorders, a corpus of 18,901 messages - or Tweets - posted to the microblogging social media service Twitter were analysed using a mixed methods approach. We present a content analysis which revealed that Tweets that contained the word &#65533;insomnia&#65533; contained significantly more negative health information than a random sample, strongly suggesting that individuals were making disclosures about their sleep disorder. A subsequent thematic analysis then revealed two themes. coping with insomnia, and describing the experience of insomnia.

Our contribution is to identify four approaches to introducing sociality to ambivalent socialisers. structured socialising, incidental socialising, eavesdropping and trace sensing.

  "Affiliations": ["Carnegie Mellon University"],
  "Abstract": "Although economists have long recognized the importance of a critical mass in growing a community, we know little about how it is achieved. This paper examines how initial topical focus influences communities' ability to attract a critical mass. When starting an online community, organizers need to define its initial scope. Topically narrow communities will probably attract a homogeneous group of interested in its content and compatible with each other. However, they are likely to attract fewer members than a diverse one because they offer only a subset of the topics. This paper reports an empirical analysis of longitudinal data collected from Twitter, where each new Twitter poster is considered the seed of a potential social collection. Users who focus the topics of their early tweets more narrowly ultimately attract more followers with more ties among them. Our results shed light on the development of online social networking structures."

  "Abstract": "Crisis response engenders a high-stress environment in which teams gather, transform, and mutually share information. Prior educational approaches have not successfully addressed these critical skills. The assumption has been that the highest fidelity simulations result in the best learning. Deploying high-fidelity simulations is expensive and dangerous; they do not address team coordination. Low-fidelity approaches are ineffective because they are not stressful. Zero-fidelity simulation develops and invokes the principle of abstraction, focusing on human-information and human-human transfers of meaning, to derive design from work practice. Our principal hypothesis is that crisis responders will experience zero-fidelity simulation as effective simulation of team coordination. We synthesize the sustained iterative design and evaluation of the Team Coordination Game. We develop and apply new experimental methods to show that participants learn to cooperate and communicate, applying what they learn in practice. Design implications address how to employ the abstraction principle to develop zero-fidelity simulations."

Four distinct layers of compliance are identified, as are three different kinds of accountability, all of which stand potentially at odds with one another. The paper examines the tensions created by this, tensions that are further aggravated by instructions usually being delivered down a thin channel, with considerable surrounding contextual complexity and little opportunity for repair, and uncovers some core challenges for future design in relation to providing instructions for, and orchestrating a range of possible activities."

Our focus is on inter-organizational cooperation practices, thus we examined the cooperation of fire departments, police, public administration, electricity infrastructure operators and citizens. Our empirical material allows to describe reasons and conditions for improvisation. Our resulting recommendations address the support of aggregation and visualization of information, a necessary individualization of information compositions, options for collaborative situation assessment, requirements for informal and formal communication, and accessibility of information resources."

  "Abstract": "We present a design research project on knowledge sharing and activity awareness in distributed emergency management planning. In three experiments we studied groups using three different prototypes, respectively. a paper-prototype in a collocated work setting, a first software prototype in a distributed setting, and a second, enhanced software prototype in a distributed setting. In this series of studies we tried to better understand the processes of knowledge sharing and activity awareness in complex cooperative work by developing and investigating new tools that can support these processes. We explicate the design rationale behind each prototype and report the results of each experiment investigating it. We discuss how the results from each prototyping phase brought us closer to defining properties of a system that facilitate the sharing and awareness of both content and process knowledge. Our designs enhanced aspects of distributed group performance, in some respects beyond that of comparable face-to-face groups."

  "Abstract": "CHI researchers are beginning a shift from studying technology use in uncommon or exotic communities to designing and deploying technology interventions into those same settings. This paper picks up on these recent developments and further examines the impact and implication of using a bespoke technology platform within the context of providing shelter and basic social services to homeless mothers and their children. I build on findings from a previous system deployment by describing targeted changes made to the technology, the design impetus for making those changes, and the resulting impact those changes had on the relationship between shelter staff, residents, and the information they shared via the system. By way of the findings reported here, I continue to develop the framing of Deweyan publics as a way to scaffold an environmental approach to technology design in contexts with multiple and diverse stakeholders."

  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, United States", "University of California, Irvine", "University of California Irvine"],
  "Abstract": "Design and evaluation of user-generated media production and sharing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) often focus on formal and informal media sharing, such as communication within social networks, automatic notifications of activities, and the exchange of digital artifacts. However, conceptual tools for understanding how people relate to the audiences they reach through these systems are limited. The increasing interest in user-generated content in HCI demands the infusion of new methods and theories that explicitly engage the construction and use of media within and among large groups of individuals and systems. In this paper, we suggest that the notion of \"publics,\" drawn from media theory, provides useful insights into user-driven, social, and cultural forms of technology use and digital content creation. We illustrate this by employing the notion of publics to the findings from a two-month deployment of a mobile photo sharing platform in a youth housing community. The results of this empirical work coupled with a theoretical examination of publics stimulate reflection on prevailing interpretations of user-designer-reader roles. The paper provides an outlook for potentially new and productive ways of understanding interdependencies within those activities. Implications that can be drawn from this work concern the role of digital media creation and sharing for the formation of collectives and how people position themselves collectively in relation to larger social groups and societal norms. The analysis suggests fruitful crossovers among HCI, Media Theory and New Media Research by approaching the user as both consumer and producer of digital content."

  "Abstract": "Viewpoint is a public voting device developed to allow residents in a disadvantaged community to make their voices heard through a simple, lightweight interaction. This was intended to open a new channel of communication within the community and increase community members' perception of their own efficacy. Local elected officials and community groups were able to post questions on devices located in public spaces, where residents could vote for one of two responses. Question authors were subsequently required to post a response indicating any actions to be taken. Following a two-month trial, we present our experiences and contribute guidelines for the design of public democracy tools and dimensions impacting their effectiveness, including credibility, efficacy and format."

  "Abstract": "This paper investigates how citizens use technology to support community policing efforts. To explore the types of conversations that are shared on the community web forum, we conducted a qualitative study. We analyzed 865 forum posts from a community crime web forum from April 2004 to June 2011. We found that residents use the forum to. 1) build relationships by strengthening social ties, 2) discuss ways to take collective action, 3) share information and advice, and 4) regulate the social norms of the neighborhood and the web forum. Results suggest that technologies intended for crime prevention should be designed to support communication and problem-solving discussions amongst residents, as opposed to simply providing information to citizens."

  "Authors": ["Beryl Plimmer", "Peter Reid", "Rachel Blagojevic", "Andrew Crossan", "Stephen Brewster"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand", "University of Auckland", "University of Glasgow"],
  "Abstract": "We present McSig, a multimodal system for teaching blind children cursive handwriting so that they can create a personal signature. For blind people handwriting is very difficult to learn as it is a near-zero feedback activity that is needed only occasionally, yet in important situations; for example to make an attractive and repeatable signature for legal contracts. McSig aids the teaching of signatures by translating digital ink from the teacher&#8217;s stylus gestures into three non-visual forms. (1) audio pan and pitch represents the x and y movement of the stylus; (2) kinaesthetic information is provided to the student through a force-feedback haptic pen which mimics the teacher&#8217;s stylus movement; (3) a physical tactile line on the writing sheet is created by the haptic pen. McSig has been developed over two major iterations of design, usability testing and evaluation. The final step of the first iteration was a short evaluation with eight visually impaired children. The results suggested that McSig had the highest potential benefit for congenitally and totally blind children and also indicated some areas where McSig could be enhanced. The second prototype incorporated significant modifications to the system, improving the audio, tactile and force-feedback. We then ran a detailed, longitudinal evaluation over 14 weeks with three of the congenitally blind children to assess McSig&#8217;s effectiveness in teaching the creation of signatures. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of McSig &#8211; they all made considerable progress in learning to create a recognizable signature. By the end of ten lessons two of the children could form a complete, repeatable signature unaided, the third could do so with a little verbal prompting. Furthermore, during this project we have learnt valuable lessons about providing consistent feedback between different communications channels (by manual interactions, haptic device, pen correction) that will be of interest to others developing multimodal systems."

  "Abstract": "Technology has the promise to transform educational prac-tices worldwide. In particular, cognitive tutoring systems are an example of educational technology that has been ex-tremely effective at improving mathematics learning over traditional classroom instruction. However, studies on the effectiveness of tutor software have been conducted mainly in the United States, Canada, and Western Europe, and little is known about how these systems might be used in other contexts with differing classroom practices and values. To understand this question, we studied the usage of mathematics tutoring software for middle school at sites in three Latin American countries. Brazil, Mexico, and Costa Rica. While cognitive tutors were designed for individual use, we found that students in these classrooms worked collaboratively, engaging in interdependently paced work and conducting work away from their own computer. In this paper we present design recommendations for how cognitive tutors might be incorporated into different classroom practices, and better adapted for student needs in these environments."

  "Abstract": "This paper is based on a case study of six African countries. It takes a look at education challenges faced by African youth and the gaps that exist in the education systems. African youth have the potential to be frontrunners in socio-economic transformation in the continent. They need to be empowered to be able to play their part. The huge gaps between education policy and practice, and other problems in this sector leave many African youth out of the system. Information and communication technology (ICT) is being integrated in education in many African countries. The emphasis has been on equipping schools with computers and literacy of the same. However the progress and impact is minimal due to inadequate resources, infrastructural challenges and lack of capacity. Mobile phone penetration in the continent has increased phenomenally unlike ownership of personal computers. This paper therefore proposes m-learning using mobile phones as a logical and viable channel of delivering education to African youth."

  "Authors": ["David Dearman", "Khai Truong"],

  "Abstract": "An essential aspect of learning a second language is the acquisition of vocabulary. However, acquiring vocabulary is often a protracted process that requires repeated and spaced exposure; which can be difficult to accommodate given the busyness of daily living. In this paper, we explore if a learner can implicitly acquire second language vocabulary through her explicit interactions with her mobile phone (e.g., navigating multiple home screens) using an interface we developed called Vocabulary Wallpaper. In addition, we examine if the type of vocabulary this technique exposes to the learner, whether it is contextually relevant or contextually-independent will influence the learner&#8217;s rate of vocabulary acquisition. The results of our study show participants were able to use Vocabulary Wallpaper to increase the number of second language vocabulary that they can recognize and recall and their rate of vocabulary acquisition was significantly greater when presented with a contextually relevant vocabulary than a contextually-independent vocabulary."

  "Abstract": "Sleep is a basic physiological process essential for good health. However, 40 million people in the U.S. are diagnosed with sleep disorders, with many more undiagnosed. To help address this problem, we developed an application, ShutEye, which provides a peripheral display on the wall-paper of the user's mobile phone to promote awareness about recommended activities that promote good sleep quality. Based on preferences about the user's desired bed-time and activities' for example, consuming caffeine or performing vigorous exercise. ShutEye displays guidance about when engaging in those activities is likely to affect sleep without requiring any explicit interaction from the user. In this paper, we describe ShutEye and results from a four-week field study with 12 participants. Results indicate that a simple, recommendation-based peripheral display can be a very low-effort but still effective method for improving awareness of healthy sleep habits. We also provide recommendations about designing peripheral displays and extend insights for designing health-based mobile applications."

  "Abstract": "The awareness that hospital patients have of the people and events surrounding their care has a dramatic impact on satisfaction and clinical outcomes. However, patients are often under-informed about even basic aspects of their care. In this work, we hypothesize that mobile devices - which are increasingly available to patients - can be used as real-time information conduits to improve patient awareness and consequently improve patient care. To better understand the unique affordances that mobile devices offer in the hospital setting, we provided twenty-five patients with mobile phones that presented a dynamic, interactive report on their progress, care plan, and care team throughout their emergency department stay. Through interviews with these patients, their visitors, and hospital staff, we explore the benefits and challenges of using the mobile phone as an information display, finding overall that this is a promising approach to improving patient awareness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that only a small number of technology challenges remain before such a system could be deployed without researcher intervention."

We discuss strategies to reduce attrition, and present SilverCloud, a platform designed to provide more engaging online experiences. The paper presents the results of a practice-based clinical study in which 45 clients and 6 therapists used an online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy programme for depression. Pre and post-treatment assessments, using the Beck Depression Inventory, indicate a statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms, with a large effect size, for the moderate-to-severe clinical sub-sample receiving standalone online treatment (n=18). This group was the primary target for the intervention. A high level of engagement was also observed compared to a prior online intervention used within the same service. We discuss strategies for design in this area and consider how the quantitative and qualitative results contribute towards our understanding of engagement."

  "Abstract": "User trials of mobile applications have followed a steady march out of the lab, and progressively further &#8216;into the wild&#8217;, recently involving &#8216;app store&#8217;-style releases of software to the general public. Yet from our experiences on these mass participation systems and a survey of the literature, we identify a number of reported difficulties. We propose a hybrid methodology that aims to address these, by combining a global software release with a concurrent local trial. A phone&#8211;based game, created to explore the uptake and use of ad hoc peer-to-peer networking, was evaluated using this new hybrid trial method, combining a small-scale local trial (11 users) with a &#8216;mass participation&#8217; trial (over 10,000 users). Our hybrid method offers many benefits, allowing locally observed findings to be verified, patterns in globally collected data to be explained and addresses ethical issues raised by the mass participation approach. We note trends in the local trial that did not appear in the larger scale deployment, and which would therefore have led to misleading results were the application trialled using &#8216;traditional&#8217; methods alone. Based on this study and previous experience, we provide a set of guidelines to researchers working in this area."

  "Abstract": "Although HCI researchers and practitioners frequently work with groups of people that differ significantly from themselves, little attention has been paid to the effects these differences have on the evaluation of HCI systems. Via 450 interviews in Bangalore, India, we measure participant response bias due to interviewer demand characteristics and the role of social and demographic factors in influencing that bias. We find that respondents are about 2.5x more likely to prefer a technological artifact they believe to be developed by the interviewer, even when the alternative is identical. When the interviewer is a foreign researcher requiring a translator, the bias towards the interviewer's artifact increases to 5x. In fact, the interviewer's artifact is preferred even when it is degraded to be obviously inferior to the alternative. We conclude that participant response bias should receive more attention within the CHI community, especially when designing for underprivileged populations."

The ability to record and share such data has created a critical moment in the practice and scope of behavioral research. While recent work is beginning to develop techniques for visualizing and interacting with integrated multimodal information collected during field research, navigating and analyzing these large datasets remains challenging and tools are especially needed to support the early stages of data exploration. In this paper we describe digital pen and paper practices in observational research and their integration with ChronoViz, a tool for annotating, visualizing, and analyzing multimodal data. The goal is to better support researchers both in the field, while collecting data, and later in the lab, during analysis. We document the co-evolution of notetaking practices and system features as 28 participants used the tool during an 18-month deployment."

  "Abstract": "Past studies of user behavior in Web search have correlated eye-gaze and mouse cursor positions, and other lines of research have found cursor interactions to be useful in determining user intent and relevant parts of Web pages. However, cursor interactions are not all the same; different types of cursor behavior patterns exist, such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, each of which has a different meaning. We conduct a search study with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the gaze-cursor alignment, findings which lead us to question the maxim that 'gaze is well approximated by cursor.' These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor. Our new technique can help make better use of large-scale cursor data in identifying how users examine Web search pages."

  "Authors": ["Minyoung Song", "Chris Quintana"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Michigan"],
  "Abstract": "Teaching and learning the vast range of the sizes of the objects that are too small to see with human eyes (called imperceptible objects) has been a challenging issue in education. Because representation is the only medium that learners can use to make sense of imperceptible phenomena, learners encounter challenges when trying to understand the range of imperceptible sizes. However, the conventional visual representations that are incorporated in many learning technologies tend to direct learners to overestimate the sizes of imperceptible objects. To address this issue, we designed a multimodal representation called \"temporal-aural-visual representation (or TAVR) to provide students with an alternative way of perceiving and conceptualizing imperceptible sizes. In prior studies it was noticed that learners constructed more refined mental models of the vast range of imperceptible sizes through the TAVR-enhanced learning activity. In this paper, we introduce a recent study that explored how to best augment the temporal experience of the range of imperceptible sizes with supporting modalities."

  "Type": "Paper",

  "Authors": ["Thomas Davies", "Ashweeni Beeharee"],
  "Affiliations": ["University College London"],
  "Abstract": "Insights into human visual attention have benefited many areas of computing, but perhaps most significantly visualisation and UI design [3]. With the proliferation of mobile devices capable of supporting significantly complex applications on small screens, demands on mobile UI design and the user&#65533;s visual system are becoming greater. In this paper, we report results from an empirical study of human visual attention, specifically the Change Blindness phenomenon, on handheld mobile devices and its impact on mobile UI design. It is arguable that due to the small size of the screen - unlike a typical computer monitor - a greater visual coverage of the mobile device is possible, and that these phenomena may occur less frequently during the use of the device, or even that they may not occur at all. Our study shows otherwise. We tested for Change Blindness (CB) and Inattentional Blindness (IB) in a single-modal, mobile context and attempted to establish factors in the application interface design that induce and/or reduce their occurrences. The results show that both CB and IB can and do occur while using mobile devices. The results also suggest that the number of separate attendable items on-screen is directly proportional to rates of CB. Newly inserted objects were correctly identified more often than changes applied to existing on-screen objects. These results suggest that it is important for mobile UI designers to take these aspects of visual attention into account when designing mobile applications that attempt to deliver information through visual changes or notifications."

We suggest that serendipity can be facilitated through visualization. To explore this, we introduce the Bohemian Bookshelf, which aims to support serendipitous discoveries in the context of digital book collections. The Bohemian Bookshelf consists of five interlinked visualizations each offering a unique overview of the collection. It aims at encouraging serendipity by (1) offering multiple visual access points to the collection, (2) highlighting adjacencies between books, (3) providing flexible visual pathways for exploring the collection, (4) enticing curiosity through abstract, metaphorical, and visually distinct representations of books, and (5) enabling a playful approach to information exploration. A deployment at a library revealed that visitors embraced this approach of utilizing visualization to support open-ended explorations and serendipitous discoveries. This encourages future explorations into promoting serendipity through information visualization."

  "Abstract": "Information Foraging Theory (IFT) has established itself as an important theory to explain how people seek information, but most work has focused more on the theory itself than on how best to apply it. In this paper, we investigate how to apply a reactive variant of IFT (Reactive IFT) to design IFT-based tools, with a special focus on such tools for ill-structured problems. Toward this end, we designed and implemented a variety of recommender algorithms to empirically investigate how to help people with the ill-structured problem of finding where to look for information while debugging source code. We varied the algorithms based on scent type supported (words alone vs. words + code structure), and based on use of foraging momentum to estimate rapidity of foragers' goal changes. Our empirical results showed that (1) using both words and code structure significantly improved the ability of the algorithms to recommend where software developers should look for information; (2) participants used recommendations to discover new places in the code and also as shortcuts to navigate to known places; and (3) low-momentum recommendations were significantly more useful than high-momentum recommendations, suggesting rapid and numerous goal changes in this type of setting. Overall, our contributions include two new recommendation algorithms, empirical evidence about when and why participants found IFT-based recommendations useful, and implications for the design of tools based on Reactive IFT."

FlexCam augments a thinfilm color Flexible Organic Light Emitting Diode (FOLED) photographic viewfinder display with an array of lenses at the back. Our prototype allows for the photograph to act as a camera, exploiting flexibility of the viewfinder as a means to dynamically re-configure images captured by the photograph. FlexCam&#8217;s flexible camera array has altered optical characteristics when flexed, allowing users to dynamically expand and contract the camera's field of view (FOV). Integrated bend sensors measure the amount of flexion in the display. The degree of flexion is used as input to software, which dynamically stitches images from the camera array and adjusts viewfinder size to reflect the virtual camera&#8217;s FOV. Our prototype envisions the use of photographs as cameras in one aggregate flexible, thin-film device."

  "Abstract": "Combiform is a novel digital gaming console featuring four combinable handheld controllers. It is a new and unique tangible gaming interface that stresses the importance of co-located, co-attentive social interactions among players. In particular, multiple players may freely combine and lock together their handheld game controllers, thereby creating a very flexible collective and transformable tangible interface. Combiform emphasizes social interaction through controller-to-controller contact. The platform and its 10 games introduce novel, tangible and physical co-attentive experiences that are not found in traditional co-located gaming platforms using &#8216;embodied&#8217; controllers (e.g. Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect). Based on observations, this new interactive technique has successfully transformed typical co-located social play experiences into a multisensory physical activity."

  "Type": "Interactivity",
  "Key": "in159",
  "Authors": ["Ali Israr", "Seung-Chan Kim", "Jan Stec", "Ivan Poupyrev"],
  "Affiliations": ["Disney Research Pittsburgh", "Disney Research"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper we propose an architecture for rendering rich and high-resolution haptic feedback on the user&#8217;s body while playing interactive games. The haptic architecture consists of three main elements, namely, haptic engine, haptic API/codec, and haptic display. The haptic engine extracts events from the game, assigns haptic feedback to these events, and sends coded packets to haptic API/codec. The haptic API/codec translates the coded packets and computes driving signals based on carefully evaluated algorithms derived from psychophysical modeling of tactile perception. The driving signals are then routed to the haptic display embedded with an array of vibratory transducers. A user feels high resolution and refined tactile sensations on the body through the display. We have integrated the Surround Haptics system with a driving simulation game to provide an enjoyable gaming experience."

  "Abstract": "We present BodiPod, a 3D 360 degree stereoscopic human anatomy browser. Our cylindrical display allows users to view a human anatomy volume at full scale from any perspective. Shutter glasses are only required if users want to examine the data stereoscopically. Users can change views simply by walking around the display volume, and interact with the human anatomy model inside the display through gesture and speech interactions, which include scaling, rotation, peeling, slicing and labeling. Our demonstration shows that using a cylindrical display has the benefits of providing stereoscopic rendering of human anatomy models at life-size scale that can be examined from any angle, while allowing interactions from an appropriate viewing distance."

We show how individuals or multiple people can interact with Stackables and combine them to formulate queries on realistic datasets. We have successfully used and evaluated Stackables in a user study with a dataset of over 1500 books and 12 facets with ranges of thousands of facet values."

We present EyeRing, a ring mounted camera, to enable applications such as identifying currency and navigating, as well as helping sighted people to tour an unknown city or intuitively translate signage. The ring apparatus is autonomous, however our system also includes a mobile phone or computation device to which it connects wirelessly, and an earpiece for information retrieval. Finally, we will discuss how different finger worn sensors may be extended and applied to other domains."

We focus specifically on visual motion, defined by attributes of motion, and their effect on accessibility, which may lead to a diminished experience for novice players. Eight expert game designers evaluated the tool embedded into a simple point and click game. Specifically they controlled attributes of speed, size of game elements, and amount of elements on screen associated to game targets, distractions, and feedback. The tool allowed experts to define difficulty settings and expose patterns, which they verified. As a game, we then investigated the effect of visual motion on accessibility in a formal user study comprised of 105 participants. As a follow-up to this work, we expanded the toolset to include 8 additional attributes of motion."

  "Abstract": "When the user is engaged with a real-world task it can be inappropriate or difficult to use a smartphone. To address this concern, we developed ShoeSense, a wearable system consisting in part of a shoe-mounted depth sensor pointing upward at the wearer. ShoeSense recognizes relaxed and discreet as well as large and demonstrative hand gestures. In particular, we designed three gesture sets (Triangle, Radial, and Finger-Count) for this setup, which can be performed without visual attention. The advantages of ShoeSense are illustrated in five scenarios. (1) quickly performing frequent operations without reaching for the phone, (2) discreetly performing operations without disturbing others, (3) enhancing operations on mobile devices, (4) supporting accessibility, and (5) artistic performances. We present a proof-of-concept, wearable implementation based on a depth camera and report on a lab study comparing social acceptability, physical and mental demand, and user preference. A second study demonstrates a 94-99% recognition rate of our recognizers."

The system replaces an existing kitchen refuse bin and automatically logs disposed of items through digital images captured by a smart phone installed on the underside of the bin lid. Captured images are uploaded to a BinCam application on Facebook where they can be explored. Engagement with BinCam is designed to fit into the existing structure of users&#8217; everyday life, with the intention that reflection on waste and recycling becomes a playful and shared group activity. Results of a user study reveal an increase in both users&#8217; awareness of, and reflection about, their waste management and their motivation to improve their waste-related skills. With BinCam, we explore informational and normative social influences as a source of change, which has to date been underexplored in persuasive HCI."

We have a field test by using TEROOS and observed that the wearable avatar innovatively assisted the users to communicate during their joint activities such as route navigating and buying goods at a shop. The user controlling TEROOS could give the user wearing it appropriate route instructions on the basis of the situation around TEROOS. In addition, both users could easily identify objects that they discussed. Moreover, shop staff members communicated with the user controlling TEROOS and behaved as they normally would when the user asked questions about the goods."

For each device a new interaction has been crafted by hard-wiring the functions of the alarm clock onto the digital switches of the controller. As a result the basic functionalities of the alarm clock &#8211; set up time, set up alarm, light on and off, alarm off - can be controlled with the joysticks. This project is a journey through the history of game controllers, to celebrate both its revolutionary successes and remarkable failures."

  "Abstract": "Exertion Games involve physical effort and as a result can facilitate physical health benefits. We present Hanging off a Bar, an action hero-inspired Exertion Game in which players hang off an exercise bar over a virtual river for as long as possible. Initial observations from three events with audiences ranging from the general public to expert game designers suggest that Hanging off a Bar can be engaging for players and facilitate intense exertion within seconds. Furthermore, we collected suggestions for what game elements players believe could entice them to increase their physical effort investment. These suggestions, combined with Hanging off a Bar as research vehicle due to the easy measurement of exertion through hanging time, enable future explorations into the relationship between digital game elements and physical exertion, guiding designers on how to support exertion in digital games."

The device prompts wearers to move in strange ways, bypassing norms of self-constraint, to actuate sound. The result is sonically and physically ungainly, yet strangely compelling, and often prompts spontaneous laughter. hipDisk emerged from an embodied, performative research approach. It began as a single user device, and evolved to support social interaction and co-creation, as well as creatively engaged, embodied discovery and learning. Using, and also observing hipDisk in use, affords insight into how ungainly, embodied, performative fun may be a powerful vehicle for embodied knowledge generation and learning."

This phenomenon holds true in both physical and digital spaces. People feel free to post their most intimate secrets on the Internet with the belief that their confessions are ephemeral and intangible. In reality, this data is perpetually archived and cached on distant servers. A disconnect exists between the perception of the transitory quality of digital data and the truth of its enduring existence. Through the weaving of the stories and secrets of strangers from the Internet into a material artifact, Embroidered Confessions represents the physical manifestation of the duality of digital information."

  "Authors": ["Jeremy Birnholtz", "Nanyi Bi", "Susan Fussell"],
  "Affiliations": ["Cornell University", "Cornell University, Ithaca"],
  "Abstract": "Informal interactions are a key element of group work, and many theoretical frameworks and systems have been developed to understand and support these conversations in distributed workgroups. In particular, systems used in several recent experiments provided information about others' current activities so that their availability for conversation could be assessed, and interruptions could be timed strategically. One issue with these experimental systems, though, is that many do not notify the observed party that these observations are taking place. There is reason to believe that such notification could be valuable to users, and that it could alter observers' behavior. Moreover, factors such as the perceived urgency of the interruption could affect willingness to violate social norms in gathering information. We report on an experiment assessing the impact of perceived visibility and task urgency on awareness checking behavior. Results suggest that people check more often when they believe their partners do not know they are checking, and more often when the task is time-constrained than when it is not."

  "Abstract": "Multitasking is the result of time allocation decisions made by individuals faced with multiple tasks. Multitasking research is important in order to improve the design of systems and applications. Since people typically use computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time, insights into this type of behavior can help develop better systems and ideal types of computer environments for modern multitasking users. In this paper, we define multitasking based on the principles of task independence and performance concurrency and develop a set of metrics for computer-based multitasking. The theoretical foundation of this metric development effort stems from an application of key principles of Activity Theory and a systematic analysis of computer usage from the perspective of the user, the task and the technology. The proposed metrics, which range from a lean dichotomous variable to a richer measure based on switches, were validated with data from a sample of users who self-reported their activities during a computer usage session. This set of metrics can be used to establish a conceptual and methodological foundation for future multitasking studies."

  "Abstract": "Though various Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based text correction techniques have been proposed, it is still difficult to correct dictation errors using speech based commands. Inspired by the successful use of crowdsourcing to solve computation tasks, we propose SocialProof, a crowdsourcing powered ASR dictation enhancement, to provide a powerful and accurate but fairly cheap ASR dictation system. SocialProof begins with the output produced by ASR engines and enhances this output using the power of crowd intelligence via MTurk service. Our system splits one ASR dictation scenario into several smaller tasks, allowing multiple people to work on different pieces of the task at the same time. Data merging strategies are used to combine multiple responses from MTurk workers to provide improved results. An evaluation of SocialProof strongly supports the effectiveness of this approach."

Furthermore, two supportive technologies were developed. natural-feature-based origami recognition and selective inductive power transferring. With these two technologies, users could easily design and implement paper-computing systems which fullfill the three characteristics in the proposed framework. Finally, an interactive system for physical origami sharing through internet is developed by using these two technologies and the presented framework."

  "Abstract": "Translators often encounter ambiguous messages while translating software. To resolve ambiguity, the translator needs to understand the context in which the message appears. Currently, context is provided via textual descriptions, or not at all. This paper describes ScreenMatch, a system which provides translators with visual context for each translatable message. It does so by matching each message with a corresponding screenshot of the application. ScreenMatch consists of a tool to gather screenshots, an algorithm to match messages to screenshots, and an interface that presents translators with screenshots alongside messages. We evaluated the system by gathering screenshots for 3 applications, using the algorithm to match messages to screenshots, and comparing results to manual matches. We found that hard-to-reproduce error messages make it difficult to gather all the screenshots. The algorithm correctly matched messages to screenshots 80% of the time when a corresponding screenshot had been gathered."

The paper finds that a greater number of links are shared across languages on Twitter, while a higher percentage of links are shared between Wikipedia articles. The higher percentage of links being shared on Wikipedia is attributed to the persistence of links and the ability for users to link articles on the same topic together across languages."

Our field studies demonstrate that people consider existing applications as inadequate to flexibly adapt to current changes in other essential factors, including, task size, complexity and interdependency and the unexpected situations that people face over time. Another key challenge facing busy people is that there is no mechanism that can monitor their work habits and match their tasks with their time constraints. Grounded in our data, we propose important requirements for tools that support users in managing tasks and assessing their schedules."

To further explore the ways in which third-party applications collect users&#8217; information, I am currently conducting data analysis to identify permissions that tend to bundle together, permission collecting patterns that exist in different categories of applications, and the information collecting patterns of large developers versus smaller developers."

With the advent of 3D visual programming systems, abstract graphical representations of the algorithmic processes that generate the geometry of a building have become a subject of discussion. These discussions require collaboration among many professions. The system presented in this paper provides an interactive interface for navigation and editing of a Grasshopper visual programming \"canvas\" for the Rhinoceros 3D modeling program. It uses a tabletop display of the Grasshopper canvas and touch-based input for navigation and manipulation of algorithmic components. A wall-projected display provides synchronized real-time visualization of the 3D model. The aim of the interface is to facilitate dynamic decision-making, increase team understanding and provide an integrated environment for collaborative interaction with parametrically driven designs."

  "Authors": ["Chris Harrison", "John Horstman", "Gary Hsieh", "Scott Hudson"],

  "Abstract": "Small point lights (e.g., LEDs) are used as indicators in a wide variety of devices today, from digital watches and toasters, to washing machines and desktop computers. Although exceedingly simple in their output - varying light intensity over time - their design space can be rich. Unfortunately, a survey of contemporary uses revealed that the vocabulary of lighting expression in popular use today is small, fairly unimaginative, and generally ambiguous in meaning. In this paper, we work through a structured design process that points the way towards a much richer set of expressive forms and more effective communication for this very simple medium. In this process, we make use of five different data gathering and evaluation components to leverage the knowledge, opinions and expertise of people outside our team. Our work starts by considering what information is typically conveyed in this medium. We go on to consider potential expressive forms - how information might be conveyed. We iteratively refine and expand these sets, concluding with ideas gathered from a panel of designers. Our final step was to make use of thousands of human judgments, gathered in a crowd-sourced fashion (265 participants), to measure the suitability of different expressive forms for conveying different information content. This results in a set of recommended light behaviors that mobile devices, such as smartphones, could readily employ."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Munich LMU", "University of Calgary", "Columbia University"],
  "Abstract": "Handheld optical projectors provide a simple way to over-come the limited screen real-estate on mobile devices. We present virtual projection (VP), an interaction metaphor inspired by how we intuitively control the position, size, and orientation of a handheld optical projector&#65533;s image. VP is based on tracking a handheld device without an optical projector and allows selecting a target display on which to position, scale, and orient an item in a single gesture. By relaxing the optical projection metaphor, we can deviate from modeling perspective projection, for example, to con-strain scale or orientation, create multiple copies, or offset the image. VP also supports dynamic filtering based on the projection frustum, creating overview and detail applications, and selecting portions of a larger display for zooming and panning. We show exemplary use cases implemented using our optical feature-tracking framework and present the results of a user study demonstrating the effectiveness of VP in complex interactions with large displays."

  "Abstract": "In this paper we describe the design and development of a multi-touch surface and software that challenges current approaches to the production and consumption of comics. Authorship of the comics involves drawing the 'top level' of the story directly onto paper and projecting lower-level narrative elements, such as objects, characters, dialogue, descriptions and/or events onto the paper via a multi-touch interface. In terms of the impact this has upon the experience of reading and writing, the implementation of paper is intended to facilitate the creation of high-level overviews of stories, while the touch surface allows users to generate branches through the addition of artifacts in accordance with certain theories about interactive narratives. This provides the opportunity to participate in the reading and authoring of both traditional, paper-based texts and interactive, digital scenarios. Prototype comics are used to demonstrate this approach to reading and writing top-level and low-level narratives."

We have now examined the evolving patterns of usage in publicly available canvas presentations and found that the benefits of this format that have been demonstrated in the lab setting also can be observed in real life presentations. This confirms the potential of canvas based tools to help authors improve the quality of their presentation visuals."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Glasgow"],
  "Abstract": "This paper presents a systematic and general technique for establishing a set of motions suitable for use with sensor systems, by drawing performable and measurable motions directly from users. It uses reinforcement which rewards originality to induce users to explore the space of motions they can perform. A decomposition of movements into motion primitives is constructed, among which a meaningful originality metric can be defined. Because the originality measure is defined in terms of the sensed input, the resulting space contains only movements which can both be performed and sensed. We show how this can be used to evaluate the relative performance of different joint user-sensor systems, providing objective analyses of gesture lexicons with regard to the technical limitations of sensors and humans. In particular, we show how the space of motions varies across the arm for a body-mounted inertial sensor."

  "Authors": ["Simon Fothergill", "Helena M. Mentis", "Pushmeet Kohli", "Sebastian Nowozin"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Cambridge", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Entertainment and gaming systems such as the Wii and XBox Kinect have brought touchless, body-movement based interfaces to the masses. Systems like these enable the estimation of movements of various body parts from raw inertial motion or depth sensor data. However, the interface developer is still left with the challenging task of creating a system that recognizes these movements as embodying meaning. The machine learning approach for tackling this problem requires the collection of data sets that contain the relevant body movements and their associated semantic labels. These data sets directly impact the accuracy and performance of the gesture recognition system and should ideally contain all natural variations of the movements associated with a gesture. This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the most appropriate semiotic modality of instructions for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of modality has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system; particularly in terms of correctness and coverage."

  "Affiliations": ["Drexel University", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Gestural input can greatly improve computing experiences away from the desktop, and has the potential to provide always-available access to computing. Specifically, accelerometers and gyroscopes worn on the arm (e.g., in a wristwatch) can sense arm gestures, enabling natural input in untethered scenarios. Two core components of any gesture recognition system are detecting when a gesture is occurring and classifying which gesture a person has performed. In previous work, accurate detection has required significant computation, and high-accuracy classification has come at the cost of training the system on a per-user basis. In this note, we present a gesture detection method whose computational complexity does not depend on the duration of the gesture, and describe a novel method for recognizing gestures with only a single example from a new user."

  "Abstract": "Unlike lab environments, the existing environment is not built for smart applications, but rather should be 'upgraded' to support new technologies. The result of this process is called the 'accidentally smart home'. We developed Clipoid, an augmentable wireless technology toolkit for supporting the development of an 'accidentally smart home' environment. We observed the real user context (static, moving) with Clipoid. We present a guideline for developing an augmentation toolkit, and identify human needs of close proximity physical interaction and multiple users-public platforms."

  "Abstract": "In building location-based services, it is important to present information in ways that fit with how individuals view and navigate the city. We conducted an adaptation of the 1970s Mental Maps study by Stanley Milgram in order to better understand differences in people's views of the city based on their backgrounds and technology use. We correlated data from a demographic questionnaire with the map data from our participants to perform a first-of-its-kind statistical analysis on differences in hand-drawn city maps. We describe our study, findings, and design implications for location-based services."

  "Abstract": "When searching for destinations and activities, the interests and knowledge of locals and non-locals may vary. In this paper, we compare and contrast the search-related interests of these two groups, and when they share a common inter-est (in our case, for restaurants), we analyze the quality of the venues they intend to visit. We find differences in interests depending on local knowledge, and that locals generally select higher-quality venues than non-locals. These findings have implications for search and recommendation systems that can personalize results based on local knowledge and leverage that knowledge to benefit non-locals."

  "Abstract": "Vast amounts of mobile services and applications are being offered to end users via app stores and service providers' web sites. In addition, users take part in the distribution of services by recommending services to each other, i.e. through various word-of-mouth practices. To understand the current patterns of user-initiated service distribution, we conducted an exploratory survey study (N=203) to investigate the recommendation practices and motivations of mobile service users in situations where they recommend to other(s) and other(s) recommend to them. We found that the dominating way to recommend mobile services to others is to tell about the service in face-to-face situations, despite available support for electronic sharing in mobile situations. Social media was also used, but clearly less frequently. Based on the findings of this study, we present design ideas for supporting users in their recommendation practices."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Bristol", "University of Bath"],
  "Abstract": "Mobile devices are increasingly providing novel ways for users to engage with the spaces around them. However, there are few systematic studies of enhancing spatial ability with mobile devices, and applications such as turn-by-turn navigation systems have even been associated with a decline in spatial skills. In this paper we present a study based on the 1971 Shepard-Metzler mental rotation test but performed on a mobile-phone handset and a tablet PC. Our study extends the original experiment with the incorporation of touch and tilt interaction techniques, in order to determine if these affect the use and acquisition of spatial skills. Results suggest that the task is performed faster, and with no significant difference in accuracy, when participants rely on mental abilities rather than interaction techniques to perform 3D rotations. We also find significant differences between tablet and phone handset platforms under interactive conditions. We conclude that applications on mobile devices could be designed to enhance rather than erode spatial skills, by supporting the use of imagination to align real and virtual content."

  "Abstract": "In-car GPS based satellite navigation systems are now a common part of driving, providing turn-by-turn navigation instructions on smartphones, portable units or in-car dashboard navigation systems. This paper uses interactional analysis of video data from fifteen naturalistically recorded journeys with GPS to understand the navigational practices deployed by drivers and passengers. The paper documents five types of 'trouble' where GPS systems cause issues and confusion for drivers around. destinations, routes, maps & sensors, timing and relevance and legality. The paper argues that to design GPS systems better we need to move beyond the notion of a docile driver who follows GPS command blindly, to a better understanding of how drivers, passengers and GPS systems work together. We develop this in discussing how technology might better support 'instructed action'."

User expectations and aspirations around their TV experiences are changing radically as the platform increasingly supplements broadcast network connectivity with IP connectivity. Despite the relative youth of the platform, it is clear that Connected TV and its users support and seek user experiences which are quite distinctive from web browsing on personal computers, or earlier forms of interactive TV platforms. We describe a number of the BBC&#8217;s recent research projects developing knowledge and tools to support future user experiences for TV, ranging from typography to alternative input interfaces. In each case, we describe the motivation, the development approach and the empirical assessment of impact of the technology and experiences embodied by our prototypes."

  "Authors": ["Paul Seitlinger", "Tobias Ley"],
  "Affiliations": ["Graz University of Technology", "Tallinn University"],
  "Abstract": "Social Tagging is a recent widespread phenomenon on the Web where people assign labels (tags) to Web resources. It has been hypothesized to support collaborative sensemaking. In this paper, we examine some of the cognitive mechanisms assumed to underlie sensemaking, namely social imitation processes. We present a multinomial model that is applied to the generation of tags. In line with the semantic imitation model of Fu and colleagues, we assume that implicit processing can be understood as a semantic reconstruction of gist. Our model contrasts this process with a recall of tags from an explicit verbatim memory trace. We tested this model in an experimental study in which after the search task students had to generate tags themselves. We exposed their answers to a multinomial model derived from Fuzzy Trace Theory to obtain independent parameter estimates for the processes of explicit recall, semantic gist reconstruction and familiarity-based recall. As it turns out, a model that assumes all processes are at play explains the data well. Similar to results of our previous study, we find an influence of search intentions on the two processes. Our results have implications for interface and interaction design of social tagging systems, as well as for tag recommendation in these environments."

In this paper we discuss the use of annotations on visualization dashboards, with a special focus on business intelligence (BI) analysis. In-depth interviews with experts lead to new annotation needs for multi-chart visualization systems, on which we based the design of a dashboard prototype that supports data and context aware annotations. We focus particularly on novel annotation aspects, such as multi-target annotations, annotation transparency across charts and data dimension levels, as well as annotation properties such as lifetime and validity. Moreover, our prototype is built on a data layer shared among different data-sources and BI applications, allowing cross application annotations. We discuss challenges in supporting context aware annotations in dashboards and other visualizations, such as dealing with changing annotated data, and provide design solutions. Finally we report reactions and recommendations from a different set of expert users."

  "Authors": ["Jonathan Back", "Anna Cox", "Duncan Brumby"],
  "Affiliations": ["University College London"],
  "Abstract": "People are prone to making more errors when multitasking. Thus in safety-critical environments, it is often considered safer to perform tasks sequentially. Here we explore how the cost of accessing information affects the way people choose to interleave. An empirical study based on a medical scenario was conducted. Participants had to program infusion pump devices using information from a prescription form. The physical and mental effort involved in accessing information was manipulated. This was achieved by varying the physical distance between the prescription form and the devices. We demonstrate that by increasing information access cost, individuals are less likely to omit a required task step. This is because they adopt a more memory-intensive strategy, which encourages interleaving at natural boundaries, i.e., after completing the programming of one of the pumps. Interleaving during programming can result in task steps being forgotten."

  "Abstract": "hipDisk is a wearable interface that extends the hips and torso horizontally to give the moving body musical capabilities. The device prompts wearers to move in strange ways, bypassing norms of self-constraint, to actuate sound. As the wearer bends and twists their torso, causing the disks to touch, a single tone may be triggered through the integrated speakers. The result is sonically and physically ungainly, yet strangely compelling, and often prompts spontaneous laughter. hipDisk emerged from an embodied, performative research approach. It began as a single user device, and evolved to support social interaction and co-creation, as well as creatively engaged, embodied discovery and learning. The focus in this paper is on the third, participatory, phase of the project, and the value of emergent, performative research."

Mischievous activity pushes the boundaries of the implicit social contract present in all online social systems, and, we argue, is of vital importance understanding online social interactions. Using examples from games and other applications, we explore mischief as an act of appropriation, which reinterprets mechanics defined by developers in unexpected and sometimes upsetting ways. Although frequently interpreted as negative and anti-social behaviour, we argue that mischief serves a vital social role, and find surprising richness in the chaos."

Based on our preliminary analysis of 69 travelogues, we explore how these texts function similar to travel postcards, as generic images of in-game events and environments that are personalized and narrativized through players&#8217; annotations. We also discuss two themes across the travelogues, (in)authenticity and individualization, that illuminate the ways players negotiate the standardizing effect of many MMOG play experiences."

'Envisioning', a characteristic future-oriented technique for design thinking, often features as significant part of our research processes in the field. This paper compares, contrasts and critiques the varied ways in which envisionings have been used within ubiquitous computing and traces their relationships to other, different envisionings, such as those of virtual reality. In unpacking envisioning, it argues primarily that envisioning should be foregrounded as a significant concern and interest within HCI. Foregrounding envisioning's frequent mix of fiction, forecasting and extrapolation, the paper recommends changes in the way we read, interpret and use envisionings through taking into account issues such as context and intended audience."

We contend that the practices of DIY and appropriation that are evident in Steampunk design provide a useful set of design strategies and implications for HCI."

To investigate this issue further we have conducted an analysis on a fascinating piece of machinery often referred to as one of the predecessors of the modern day computer, the Jacquard loom. In analysing the Jacquard loom we look at qualities in design and interaction from some different perspectives. how historical tools, crafts, and practices can inform interaction design, the role of physicality, materiality, and full-body interaction in order to rethink some current conceptions of interaction and design of computational devices."

In this case study, we reflect back over the design of an information gathering and management system built for students in higher education. We demonstrate how users can be involved in various ways over a development period that spans many years; we show that designs of different fidelities can effectively garner user feedback; and we illustrate the impact of multiple influences, including users, research team members, and resource limitations on the overall transformation of the system. We conclude with a series of lessons learned that we hope will help future researchers plan and execute their own design-implement-evaluate lifecycles."

Careful scientific scholarship should build on firm foundations, which includes re-examining old evidences in the face of new findings. Yet, as a community that strives for novelty, we have very little motivation to look back and reconsider the validity of previous work. Thus, for CHI2013 we are planning a new venue, where replicated studies can be submitted, presented, and discussed. For CHI2012, we propose a SIG to discuss the preparations for how RepliCHI will work in its first year. We invite participation from those interested in setting an agenda for facilitating replication in HCI, including those who have begun using replication as a teaching method since RepliCHI at CHI2011."

Screen captures, video records, interviews, and verbal protocols are used to analyze common procedures in this type of visual data analysis, as well as how these procedures differ among these users. Our findings present a case where skilled users can approach a similar problem with diverging analysis strategies. In the group we observed, strategies fell within two broad categories. within-graph analysis, in which a user generates a few graph layouts and interacts heavily within them, and between-graph analysis, in which a user generates a series of graphs and switches between them in sequence. Differences in strategies lead to distinct interaction patterns, and are likely to be best supported by different interface designs. We characterize these observed strategies and discuss their implications for scientific visualization design and evaluation."

This can make creating novel, custom visualizations difficult for the average person. For example, existing tools typically do not support syntax or interaction techniques that are natural to end users. To explore how to support a more natural production of data visualizations by end users, we conducted an exploratory study to illuminate the structure and content of the language employed by end users when describing data visualizations. We present our findings from the study and discuss their design implications for future visualization languages and toolkits."

  "Authors": ["Cody Dunne", "Nathalie Henry Riche", "Bongshin Lee", "Ronald Metoyer", "George Robertson"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research", "Oregon State University"],
  "Abstract": "Exploring large network datasets, such as scientific collaboration networks, is challenging because they often contain a large number of nodes and edges in several types and with multiple attributes. Analyses of such networks are often long and complex, and may require several sessions by multiple users. Therefore, it is often difficult for users to recall their own exploration history or share it with others. We introduce GraphTrail, an interactive visualization for analyzing networks through exploration of node and edge aggregates that captures users' interactions and integrates this history directly in the exploration workspace. To facilitate large network analysis, GraphTrail integrates aggregation with familiar charts, drag-and-drop interaction on a canvas, and a novel pivoting mechanism for transitioning between aggregates. Through a three-month field study with a team of archeologists and a qualitative lab study with ten users, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and the benefits of integrated exploration history, including analysis comprehension, insight discovery, and exploration recall."

Such time also means that potential avenues of exploration are ignored because the costs are perceived to be too high to run or even propose them. With sampleAction we have explored whether interaction techniques to present query results running over only incremental samples can be presented as sufficiently trustworthy for analysts both to make closer to real time decisions about their queries and to be more exploratory in their questions of the data. Our work with three teams of analysts suggests that we can indeed accelerate and open up the query process with such incremental visualizations."

  "Abstract": "Screenless mobile devices achieve maximum mobility, but at the expense of the visual feedback that is generally assumed to be necessary for spatial interaction. With Imaginary Interfaces we re-enable spatial interaction on screenless devices. Users point and draw in the empty space in front of them or on the palm of their hands. While they cannot see the results of their interaction, they do obtain some visual feedback by watching their hands move. Our user studies show that Imaginary Interfaces allow users to create simple drawings, to annotate with them and to operate interfaces, as long as their layout mimics a physical device they have used before. We demonstrate how this allows an imaginary interface to serve as a shortcut for a physical device and we believe that ultimately Imaginary Interfaces will lead to the development of standalone ultra-mobile devices."

This extended abstract shows the progress of my research and presents the design of a study that is in preparation. Around this study design I formulated research questions. My approach aims to apply motor and mental models for designing interactions and interfaces regarding human motor abilities, interaction favors, and the mental model of themselves within their environment."

  "Abstract": "An Alternate Reality Game (ARG) is a form of transmedia storytelling, with narrative elements that are distributed across multiple communications platforms, ranging from print materials to mobile devices. ARGs also represent a new genre of transmedia practice where players collaboratively hunt for clues, make sense of disparate information, and solve puzzles to advance an ever-evolving storyline. While players participate in an ARG using everyday communications tools, such as phones and web sites, the interaction design challenges are not an 'everyday' process. Designers must create and connect story bits across multiple media (video, audio, text) and multiple platforms (phones, computers, physical spaces). Further, they must engage and connect with players of varying skill levels. Few studies have explored the design process of education-based ARGs, or their relationship to participatory design. This research systematically investigates the design and play of ARGs as participatory design spaces and vehicles for scaffolding information literacy practices."

  "Authors": ["Jill Cao"],
  "Affiliations": ["Oregon State University"],
  "Abstract": "Research in end-user programming has seen many techniques aimed at making it easier for ordinary users to program. However, empirical studies continue to report barriers end users face. In my work, I propose an Idea Garden approach to help end users overcome barriers. Rooted in the Minimalist Learning Theory and theories in problem-solving and creativity, the Idea Garden aims to facilitate end-user programmers to generate and work with their own ideas. Expected benefits of this work include both a theory-based understanding of barriers and the Idea Garden approach itself, which is intended to be generalizable across different end-user programming environments."

  "Authors": ["Chien-Ming Huang"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Wisconsin-Madison"],
  "Abstract": "While various forms of online and distance learning have opened up opportunities for people to gain knowledge independent of where they are, embodied interaction with teachers or learning partners supports the social and cognitive aspects of the learning processes. To achieve effective and efficient teaching, teachers use nonverbal behaviors to communicate the focus of their attention and highlight important concepts. With the advance of technology, embodied agents (i.e., robots) keep showing promises of supporting human activities. The goal of my dissertation is to design effective nonverbal behaviors, with a concentration on gaze, hand gestures, and head movements, for embodied agents as teachers or learning partners to support people in learning. To this end, my research focuses on understanding how and what nonverbal behaviors contribute to effective learning, implementing behavioral patterns from this understanding on embodied agents, and evaluating the effectiveness of the embodied agents in various educational contexts."

  "Authors": ["Amy Voida", "Ellie Harmon", "Ban Al-Ani"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Irvine"],
  "Abstract": "We present the results of a qualitative study of the use of social computing technologies by volunteer coordinators at nonprofit organizations. The work of volunteer coordinators is bridge-building work-bringing together numerous public constituencies as well as constituencies within their organizations. One might expect this class of work to be well supported by social software, some of which has been found to enable bridging social capital. However, we find that, in many ways, this class of technology fails to adequately support volunteer coordinators' bridge-building work. We discuss a number of strategies for bridge-building via social computing technologies, numerous challenges faced by volunteer coordinators in their use of these technologies, and opportunities for designing social software to better support bridge-building between organizations and the public."

  "Abstract": "In this paper, we present the results of a study of the work practices of food assistance outreach workers. We introduce the construct of service mediation, which includes the technical, social, and knowledge labor practices involved in enabling access to and use of an e-government service. We explore the service mediation activities of outreach, technological assistance, providing knowledge, and ongoing engagement. These activities bring to light how successful service relationships involve fostering a process, bridging relationships, and providing broader scaffolding. The results of our research highlight the role service mediation plays in the use of services and service technologies in information-rich organizations. This research extends previous conceptualizations of mediation by documenting how mediators support broader service processes for their clients, transform potential beneficiaries into clients, and engage in long term assistance. Therefore, this work moves beyond prior conceptualizations of mediation that concentrate solely on enabling access and use of specific technologies."

Interactive tools to teach social skills that are personalized to the individual's needs show promise, but it is challenging to author them. We describe the design, development, and preliminary evaluation of an approach to using human computation that enables the creation of models of complex and interesting social scenarios, possible obstacles that may arise in those scenarios, and potential solutions to those obstacles. Our preliminary evaluation of the models confirms that these models have the potential to help an author create a social skills instructional module."

We present a comparative study of design and user experience practitioners who used both collaboration personas and individual personas. Participants conducted a cognitive walkthrough and provided redesign suggestions for a collaboration tool. Our results show that the focus of the cognitive walkthrough and redesign task differed, with collaboration personas showing more group focus. Collaboration personas led to a more complete discussion, as indicated by a greater amount of time spent on the task compared to individual personas. Despite prior experience and training with individual personas, collaboration personas were preferred and better supported the task, since they focused on groups of people and their interactions."

Moreover, the avatar has an anthropomorphic face that enables the user who controls it to communicate with people co-located with the user who wears it. We have a field test by using TEROOS and observed that the wearable avatar innovatively assisted the users to communicate during their joint activities such as route navigating and buying goods at a shop. The user controlling TEROOS could give the user wearing it appropriate route instructions on the basis of the situation around TEROOS. In addition, both users could easily identify objects that they discussed. Moreover, shop staff members communicated with the user controlling TEROOS and behaved as they normally would when the user asked questions about the goods."

  "Abstract": "Tools and technology do not stand apart from human values. Moreover, our tools, interactions, and infrastructures are tied intimately to human flourishing. In this SIGCHI Social Impact Award talk, I seek to inspire the CHI community to engage with socially significant issues. This talk will be a combination of personal reflections on building theory and method over a 20-year period, and a synthesis of core framings in value sensitive design. Along the way, I will dwell on method, examining roughly a dozen value sensitive design methods that taken as a whole can help researchers and designers account for human values in their technical endeavors. In so doing, I will expand the HCI design space beyond technical devices to infrastructure, policy, and social norms. Key to my discussion will be attention to the challenges of scale &#8211; across time, geography, cultures, and stakeholders. From method, I will make the turn to multi-lifespan information system design and concentrate my talk on the first project under that program &#8211; the Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal which supports peace-building and reconciliation in the aftermath of widespread violence. I will close this talk with openings. open questions in value sensitive and multi-lifespan information system design; and, more broadly, open challenges for the HCI community as we imagine the tools, interactions, and infrastructures that will underlie the futures of societies. We set our sights on progress, not perfection. Biography Batya Friedman is a Professor in the Information School, Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science, and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Human-Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington where she directs the Value Sensitive Design Research Lab. Batya pioneered value sensitive design (VSD), an approach to account for human values in the design of information systems. First developed in human-computer interaction, VSD has since been used in information management, human-robotic interaction, computer security, civil engineering, applied philosophy, and land use and transportation. Her work has focused on a wide range of values, some include privacy in public, trust, freedom from bias, moral agency, sustainability, safety, calmness, freedom of expression, and human dignity; along with a range of technologies such as web browsers, urban simulation, robotics, open source tools, mobile computing, implantable medical devices, computer security, ubiquitous computing and computing infrastructure. She is currently working on multi-lifespan information system design and on methods for envisioning &#8211; new ideas for leveraging information systems to shape our futures. Voices from the Rwanda Tribunal is an early project in this multi-lifespan information system design program. Batya received both her B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Computer vision and inertial measurement have made it possible for people to interact with computers using whole-body gestures. Although there has been rapid growth in the uses and applications of these systems, their ubiquity has been limited by the high cost of heavily instrumenting either the environment or the user. In this paper, we use the human body as an antenna for sensing whole-body gestures. Such an approach requires no instrumentation to the environment, and only minimal instrumentation to the user, and thus enables truly mobile applications. We show robust gesture recognition with an average accuracy of 93% across 12 whole-body gestures, and promising results for robust location classification within a building. In addition, we demonstrate a real-time interactive system which allows a user to interact with a computer using whole-body gestures"

  "Abstract": "Gesture is becoming an increasingly popular means of interacting with computers. However, it is still relatively costly to deploy robust gesture recognition sensors in existing mobile platforms. We present SoundWave, a technique that leverages the speaker and microphone already embedded in most commodity devices to sense in-air gestures around the device. To do this, we generate an inaudible tone, which gets frequency-shifted when it reflects off moving objects like the hand. We measure this shift with the microphone to infer various gestures. In this note, we describe the phenomena and detection algorithm, demonstrate a variety of gestures, and present an informal evaluation on the robustness of this approach across different devices and people."

We describe a technique for associating multi-touch interactions to individual users and their accelerometer-equipped mobile devices. Real-time device accelerometer data and depth camera-based body tracking are compared to associate each phone with a particular user, while body tracking and touch contacts positions are compared to associate a touch contact with a specific user. It is then possible to associate touch contacts with devices, allowing for more seamless device-display multi-user interactions. We detail the technique and present a user study to validate and demonstrate a content exchange application using this approach."

  "Abstract": "Task and reference spaces are important communication channels for remote collaboration. However, all existing systems for sharing these spaces have an inherent weakness. they cannot share arbitrary physical and digital objects on arbitrary surfaces. We present IllumiShare, a new cost-effective, light-weight device that solves this issue. It both shares physical and digital objects on arbitrary surfaces and provides rich referential awareness. To evaluate IllumiShare, we studied pairs of children playing remotely. They used IllumiShare to share the task-reference space and Skype Video to share the person space. The study results show that IllumiShare shared the play space in a natural and seamless way. We also found that children preferred having both spaces compared to having only one. Moreover, we found that removing the task-reference space caused stronger negative disruptions to the play task and engagement level than removing the person space. Similarly, we found that adding the task-reference space resulted in stronger positive disruptions."

  "Abstract": "We present a novel yet simple technique that mitigates the interference caused when multiple structured light depth cam-eras point at the same part of a scene. The technique is particularly useful for Kinect, where the structured light source is not modulated. Our technique requires only mechanical augmentation of the Kinect, without any need to modify the internal electronics, firmware or associated host software. It is therefore simple to replicate. We show qualitative and quantitative results highlighting the improvements made to interfering Kinect depth signals. The camera frame rate is not compromised, which is a problem in approaches that modulate the structured light source. Our technique is non-destructive and does not impact depth values or geometry. We discuss uses for our technique, in particular within instrumented rooms that require simultaneous use of multiple overlapping fixed Kinect cameras to support whole room interactions."

  "Abstract": "In the past two decades, as technology has moved from the workplace to nearly all aspects of our everyday lives, HCI has also increased the breadth and depth of its research agenda. The breadth increase can be seen in the increasingly broad understanding of stakeholders and long-term socio-cultural-environmental consequences of interactive technologies. The depth increase can be seen in the seriousness with which HCI takes complex, subjective dimensions of interaction, such as affect, identity, experience, aesthetics. Humanistic forms of scholarship, including theories, methodologies, and scholarly forms, have increasingly been used to address many of these breadth and depth issues. In this panel, we explore the state of the art of humanist scholarship in HCI and consider its future trajectories."

However, interaction with structures may be complex and not well integrated with interaction with the content. Based on contextual inquiries and past work, we have identified a number of requirements for the interaction with graphical structures. We have designed and explored two interactive tools that rely on implicit and explicit structures. ManySpector, an inspector for multiple objects that help visualize and interact with used values; and links that users can draw between object properties to provide a dependency. The interactions with the tools augment the scope of interactions to multiple objects. A study showed that users understood the interactions and could use them to perform complex graphical tasks."

  "Authors": ["Abigail Evans", "Jacob O Wobbrock"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington"],
  "Abstract": "We present the Input Observer, a tool that can run quietly in the background of users&#65533; computers and measure their text entry and mouse pointing performance from everyday use. In lab studies, participants are presented with prescribed tasks, enabling easy identification of speeds and errors. In everyday use, no such prescriptions exist. We devised novel algorithms to segment text entry and mouse pointing input streams into &#65533;trials.&#65533; We are the first to measure errors for unprescribed text entry and mouse pointing. To measure errors, we utilize web search engines, adaptive offline dictionaries, an Automation API, and crowdsourcing. Capturing errors allows us to employ Crossman&#65533;s (1957) speed-accuracy normalization when calculating Fitts&#65533; law throughputs. To validate the Input Observer, we compared its measures from 12 participants over a week of computer use to the same participants&#65533; results from a lab study. Overall, in the lab and field, average text entry speeds were 74.47 WPM and 80.59 WPM, respectively. Average uncorrected error rates were near zero, at 0.12% and 0.28%. For mouse pointing, average movement times were 971 ms and 870 ms. Average pointing error rates were 4.42% and 4.66%. Average throughputs were 3.48 bits/s and 3.45 bits/s. Device makers, researchers, and assistive technology specialists may benefit from measures of everyday use."

  "Key": "paper263",
  "Authors": ["Caroline Appert", "Olivier Chapuis", "Emmanuel Pietriga"],
  "Affiliations": ["Univ Paris-Sud", "INRIA"],
  "Abstract": "In graphical user interfaces, direct manipulation consists in incremental actions that should be reversible. Typical examples include manipulating geometrical shapes in a vector graphics editor, navigating a document using a scrollbar, or moving and resizing windows on the desktop. As in many such cases, there will not be any mechanism to undo them, requiring users to manually revert to the previous state using a similar sequence of direct manipulation actions. The associated motor and cognitive costs can be high. We argue that proper and consistent mechanisms to support undo in this context are lacking, and present Dwell-and-Spring, an interaction technique that uses the metaphor of springs to enable users to undo direct manipulations. A spring widget pops up whenever the user dwells during a press-drag-release interaction, giving her the opportunity to either cancel the current manipulation or undo the last one. The technique is generic and can easily be implemented on top of existing applications to complement the traditional undo command. Empirical evaluation shows that users quickly adopt it as soon as they discover it."

WindowScape was intended to provide a more flexible and intuitive grouping model than prior systems. We report on the design process leading up to the system, and alternative designs we explored. We describe a series of formative evaluations that resulted in significant modifications to our initial prototype, as well as a deployment study of the final version, where users lived with WindowScape on a day-to-day basis. Our results from this study reveal how users react to novel aspects of our system, including its particular uses of miniaturization and its approach to grouping. We also discuss the impact of a task-oriented approach to window management on other aspects of user behavior, and the implications of this for future system design."

We reveal how DJs value vinyl and digital formats in different ways, acquire music through 'crate digging', prepare physical and digital crates of music before gigs, and how these underpin improvised selections during their performances. We document how DJs interact with promoters, venues, dancers and other DJs, revealing an etiquette that governs how they select and share music, and manage an ongoing tension between revealing and hiding metadata so as to maintain a competitive edge. We raise implications for technologies to support DJs, while also shedding light on previous studies of music consumption and sharing in other settings."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper592",
  "Authors": ["Florian Heller", "Jan Borchers"],
  "Affiliations": ["RWTH Aachen University"],
  "Abstract": "Although digital media playback and storage have several advantages, many DJs still prefer using vinyl records on turntables due to their direct manipulation and haptic qualities. The physical structure of a traditional vinyl record provides important cues for in-track navigation, such as track length or location of loud and soft passages. Digital vinyl systems use a timecode record to combine the advantages of digital playback with the handling DJs are used to. These records contain a special audio signal that is processed by a computer and mapped to information such as playback speed, direction, and absolute position in a track. However, due to their generic nature, timecode records cannot provide visual information to navigate inside individual tracks. Using top-projection, DiskPlay augments a white timecode record with individual visual cues of the medium, such as cue points or track start and end. In our observational study with four professional DJs, participants valued the co-location of visual feedback with the control vinyl on the turntable."

This vintage radio interface has been used to navigate a digital music collection. We have compared the proposed interface with the current most popular hardware, the iPod. The results of user tests with 24 participants are presented and discussed. The insights gained are encouraging enough to continue the development of one-dimensional analog controls for content discovery and retrieval."

  "Authors": ["Melissa Densmore"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Berkeley"],
  "Abstract": "This paper looks back at the deployment of Claim Mobile, a smartphone-based data collection application developed for a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Southwest Uganda. This NGO subsidizes health facilities by paying for medical services on the basis of claims submitted after the patient consultation, targeting treatment of 99,000 clients between 2006-2011. I successfully tested Claim Mobile in Summer 2008, processing 35 claims over two weeks, and then discontinued it six months later, when it became apparent that integration and scale-up of the technology would be problematic for the NGO. In addition, many issues we hoped to address through technology had been addressed through program management changes instead. I find that a) the context motivating the technology changed over time, b) simpler solutions can be as effective as new technologies, and c) prioritizing the needs of the NGO required abandoning the deployment of Claim Mobile. Thus this paper presents the value of learning from failure in the process of designing for users in developing regions."

However, the impact to date has been limited because poor communities usually lack access to computers and the Internet. This paper presents mClerk, a new platform for mobile crowdsourcing in developing regions. mClerk sends and receives tasks via SMS, making it accessible to anyone with a low-end mobile phone. However, mClerk is not limited to text. it leverages a little-known protocol to send small images via ordinary SMS, enabling novel distribution of graphical tasks. Via a 5-week deployment in semi-urban India, we demonstrate that mClerk is effective for digitizing local-language documents. Usage of mClerk spread virally from 10 users to 239 users, who digitized over 25,000 words during the study. We discuss the social ecosystem surrounding this usage, and evaluate the potential of mobile crowdsourcing to both deliver and derive value from users in developing regions."

  "Abstract": "In this paper we describe a system that uses near-field communication (NFC) tags to augment an existing socio-technical system for providing clean water to households throughout Haiti. In the pilot version, we programmed forty NFC phones for use by Haitian water technicians to track chlorine usage in two thousand households, identified by NFC tags on the drinking water buckets in homes. We are in the process of scaling this pilot up to 40,000 households- approximately a quarter of a million people - using 100 or more additional phones. The project involves collaboration between an industrial research lab (Nokia Research Center, Palo Alto), the Public Health School of a university (UC Berkeley), and an existing non-profit organization in Haiti (Deep Springs International (DSI))."

  "Abstract": "Exercising with others, such as jogging in pairs, can be socially engaging. However, if exercise partners have different fitness levels then the activity can be too strenuous for one and not challenging enough for the other, compromising engagement and health benefits. Our system, Jogging over a Distance, uses heart rate data and spatialized sound to create an equitable, balanced experience between joggers of different fitness levels who are geographically distributed. We extend this prior work by analyzing the experience of 32 joggers to detail how specific design features facilitated, and hindered, an engaging and balanced exertion experience. With this knowledge, we derive four dimensions that describe a design space for balancing exertion experiences. Measurement, Adjustment, Presentation and Control. We also present six design tactics for creating balanced exertion experiences described by these dimensions. By aiding designers in supporting participants of different physical abilities, we hope to increase participation and engagement with physical activity and facilitate the many benefits it brings about."

  "Abstract": "Acute cognitive benefits, such as temporary improvements in concentration, can result from as few as ten minutes of exercise; however, most people do not take exercise breaks throughout the day. To motivate people to receive the cognitive benefits of exercising in short bursts multiple times per day, we designed an engaging casual exergame. To determine whether there are cognitive benefits after playing our game, we conducted two studies to compare playing ten minutes of our casual exergame to a sedentary version of the game or exercise on a treadmill. We found acute cognitive benefits of the casual exergame over the sedentary version (but not treadmill exercise), demonstrated by significantly improved performance on two cognitive tests that require focus and concentration. Significant improvements were also found in participants&#65533; affective states after playing the casual exergame. Finally, our casual exergame produces similar exertion levels to treadmill exercise, but is perceived as more fun."

  "Abstract": "Older adults in nursing homes often lead sedentary lifestyles, which reduces their life expectancy. Full-body motion-control games provide an opportunity for these adults to remain active and engaged; these games are not designed with age-related impairments in mind, which prevents the games from being leveraged to increase the activity levels of older adults. In this paper, we present two studies aimed at developing game design guidelines for full-body motion controls for older adults experiencing age-related changes and impairments. Our studies also demonstrate how full-body motion-control games can accommodate a variety of user abilities, have a positive effect on mood and, by extension, the emotional well-being of older adults. Based on our studies, we present seven guidelines for the design of full-body interaction in games. The guidelines are designed to foster safe physical activity among older adults, thereby increasing their quality of life."

  "Abstract": "As the world population ages rapidly, it is likely that more elderly risks being detached from society. The possible isolation of many more elderly could lead to societal and mental health problems that could weigh down on public healthcare systems. Using surveys, focus groups, interviews and video analysis, our pilot study examines the effects of the Nintendo Wii games, examples of co-located games, between two generations (old and young), and the factors that could affect the adoption and enjoyment of computer-mediated games as entertainment and socialization aids between the elderly and the youths. This pilot study with 14 pairs of elderly-teenager participants shows that general attitude towards the other age group improves after a period of playing. The paper concludes with a discussion on design recommendations for computer-mediated games in general that can support inter-generational gameplay between the elderly and the youths, and as entertainment and socialisation aids to promote positive mental and social health of the elderly."

  "Authors": ["Scott Bateman", "Jaime Teevan", "Ryen White"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Saskatchewan", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Most searchers do not know how to use Web search engines as effectively as possible. This is due, in part, to search engines not providing feedback about how search behavior can be improved. Because feedback is an essential part of learning, we created the Search Dashboard, which provides an interface for reflection on personal search behavior. The Dashboard aggregates and presents an individual's search history and provides comparisons with that of archetypal expert profiles. Via a five-week study of 90 Search Dash-board users, we find that users are able to change aspects of their behavior to be more in line with that of the presented expert searchers. We also find that reflection can be beneficial, even without comparison, by changing participants' views about their own search skills, what is possible with search, and what aspects of their behavior may influence search success. Our findings demonstrate a new way for search engines to help users modify their search behavior for positive outcomes."

  "Authors": ["Xiaojun Yuan", "Ryen White"],
  "Affiliations": ["State University of New York", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Web users can help guide others through complex tasks in unfamiliar domains by creating ordered sequences of queries and Web pages, an activity we call trailblazing. The trails generated from this process can be surfaced by search engines to help users engaged in these tasks. However, if search engines are going to have people generate trails they need to understand whether there is value in using domain experts for trailblazing (or whether novices are sufficient). In this paper, we describe the findings of a user study of trailblazing in the medical domain, comparing domain novices and experts. We observed differences in how people in each of the groups blazed trails and the value of the trails they generated; experts were more efficient and generated better-quality trails. Although there has been significant research on contrasting novice and expert search behaviors, to our knowledge there is no work (at least in the search domain) on establishing whether artifacts created by domain experts (trails in our case) are more valuable than those created by novices. The answer to this question is important for system designers who want to learn whether investing in domain expertise is worthwhile."

Research in the area falls into two broad categories. the micro world of perception and cognition; and the macro world of organisations, systems and long-term planning. Although both kinds of research have generated insights into behaviour, the data generated by the two kinds of research have been effectively incommensurable. Designing safer and more efficient interactions in interrupted and multitasking environments requires that researchers in the area attempt to bridge the gap between these worlds. This SIG aims to stimulate discussion of the tools and methods we need as a community in order to further our understanding of interruptions and multitasking."

We describe the NB system and its evaluation in real class environment, where students used it to submit their reading assignments, ask questions and get or provide feedback. We show that this tool can be and has been successfully incorporated into a number of different classes at different institutions. To understand how and why, we focus on a particularly successful class deployment where the instructor adapted his teaching style to take students' comment into account. We analyze the annotation practices that were observed---including the way geographic locality was exploited in ways unavailable in traditional forums---and discuss general design implications for online annotation tools in academia."

AccessRank uses many sources of input to generate its predictions, including recency, frequency, temporal clustering, and time of day. Simulations based on log records of real user interaction across a diverse range of applications show that AccessRank more accurately predicts upcoming accesses than other algorithms. The prediction lists generated by AccessRank are also shown to be more stable than other algorithms that have good predictive capability, which can be important for usability when items are presented in lists as users can rely on their spatial memory for target location. Finally, we present examples of how real world applications might use AccessRank."

We describe a 2x2 factorial experiment that manipulates a simulated recommender system's monitoring of user behavior (monitoring. present vs. absent) and whom the system is perceived to benefit (benefit. corporate vs. consumer). We find that attitudes toward being monitored are moderated by perceptions about system intentions. We propose an explanatory mechanism and highlight the value of understanding the subjective experience of interacting with recommender systems."

Motivated by these positive results, we propose a design space framework and its associated algorithms to support both global and contextual recommendations. To evaluate the algorithms, we developed the CommunityCommands plug-in for AutoCAD. This plug-in enabled us to perform a 6-week user study of real-time, within-application command recommendations in actual working environments. We report and visualize command usage behaviors during the study, and discuss how the recommendations affected users behaviors. In particular, we found that the plug-in successfully exposed users to new commands, as unique commands issued signi&#64257;cantly increased."

This is an important and nuanced step in expertise location that has not received a great deal of attention. Through a lab-based, controlled investigation with 35 enterprise workers, we found that presenting additional information about each recommended person in a search result list led the participants to make quicker and better-informed selections. These results focus attention on a currently understudied aspect of expertise location--expertise selection--that could greatly improve the usefulness of supporting systems. We also asked participants to rate the type of information that might be most useful for expertise selection on a paper prototype containing 36 types of potentially helpful information. We identified sixteen types of this information that may be most useful for various expertise selection tasks."

  "Abstract": "We designed and ran an experiment to measure social influence in online recommender systems, specifically how often people's choices are changed by others' recommendations when facing different levels of confirmation and conformity pressures. In our experiment participants were first asked to provide their preferences between pairs of items. They were then asked to make second choices about the same pairs with knowledge of others' preferences. Our results show that others people's opinions significantly sway people's own choices. The influence is stronger when people are required to make their second decision sometime later (22.4%) than immediately (14.1%). Moreover, people seem to be most likely to reverse their choices when facing a moderate, as opposed to large, number of opposing opinions. Finally, the time people spend making the first decision significantly predicts whether they will reverse their decisions later on, while demographics such as age and gender do not. These results have implications for consumer behavior research as well as online marketing strategies."

Our approach supplements these traditional communication mediums by exploiting \"touch\" &#8211; a sensation that is dominant in almost every relationship. We designed, built and tested a prototype touch device, with the intention of bringing couples closer together during a regular Skype conversation, by allowing each to feel the other&#8217;s touch. Our study showed that participants found touching each other in this way was intriguing, enabling them to feel the other person&#8217;s hand touching theirs at a distance, and in doing so bridging the distance between them."

To explore the problem space we conducted interviews in the canton of Zurich in Switzerland. Although our interviews showed that the participants are generally happy with their neighborhoods, there are still some barriers to overcome in personal communication between neighbors. These are mostly time related or because of overacted cautiousness. The interviews further showed that gift-giving often improves relationships and enables communication. These findings led to a couple of design ideas of which we chose the most promising to investigate further. Our final solution was a concept of a mobile agent ``SharryBot'' which can distribute gifts among the neighborhood and thereby connecting people in an effective way. The robot should not only make the neighbors known to each other but it should also improve face-to-face communication when neighbors communicate later."

The phone will vibrate and record the echoes with its accelerometer or microphone, analyze those echoes and distinguish if it has felt the vibrations of this particular surface before, or not. From this it could potentially recognize some kind of feeling of being at home or hominess. Basically, this paper presents a material exploration for how we potentially could come to use the accelerometer and the microphone nowadays embedded in almost all mobile phones."

Our primary goal was to create a device that can enhance the display of art, capturing the experience families have both when the child creates the art and when they reflect on that art together. The display device removes the burden of organizing and displaying the art children create so that families can enjoy the art in their homes instead."

  "Abstract": "Pets are important household members, and their welfare and safety are imperative to the emotional welfare of the family. Displacement of pets after disaster events is a serious matter to families and for public safety at large. People are not willing to evacuate without their non-human family members; many will break through evacuation zones to recover animals left behind. In the 2005 Hurricane Katrina event, over 200,000 pets were displaced, and 95% of them were never reunited with their families. The US Department of Agriculture confirms that the problem of reuniting displaced pets and their guardians at this scale is unfortunately common in disaster events. We introduce No Place Like Home, a socially networked web and mobile platform that facilitates reunification of non-human with human family members following disaster events. No Place Like Home is an effort that supports the formation of small cadres of micro-tasking \"digital volunteers\" that converge after disasters to do photo- and description-matching; employs a reputation and reward system to encourage use; and uses match-based machine learning techniques to accelerate the manual matching tasks performed by digital volunteers."

  "Abstract": "ZeroTouch (ZT) is a unique optical sensing technique and architecture that allows precision sensing of hands, fingers, and other objects within a constrained 2-dimensional plane. ZeroTouch provides tracking at 80 Hz, and up to 30 concurrent touch points. Integration with LCDs is trivial. While designed for multi-touch sensing, ZT enables other new modalities, such as pen+touch and free-air interaction. In this paper, we contextualize ZT innovations with a review of other flat-panel sensing technologies. We present the modular sensing architecture behind ZT, and examine early diverse uses of ZT sensing."

These displays provide new functionalities such as personalized views for multiple users, privacy protection, and stereoscopic 3D displays. However, current multi-view displays rely on special hardware, thus significantly limiting their availability to consumers and adoption in everyday scenarios. In this paper, we present a pure software solution (i.e. with no hardware modification) that allows us to present two independent views concurrently on the most widely used and affordable type of LCD screen, namely Twisted Nematic (TN). We achieve this by exploiting a technical limitation of the technology which causes these LCDs to show varying brightness and color depending on the viewing angle. We describe our technical solution as well as demonstrate example applications in everyday scenarios."

We conclude by discussing practical uses of our system, Ultra-Tangibles, in the creation of new tangible user interfaces."

We achieve this using a system of wires and connectors inside each block that causes the capacitance of the bottom-most block to reflect the entire assembly. We demonstrate three types of tangibles, called CapStones, Zebra Dials and Zebra Sliders that work with current consumer hardware and investigate what designs may become possible as touchscreen hardware evolves."

It provides a continuous, supplemental input stream to an interactive human-robot system, which uses this information to modify its behavior to better support multitasking. This paper demonstrates that we can use non-invasive methods to detect signals coming from the brain that users naturally and effortlessly generate while using a computer system. If used with care, this additional information can lead to systems that respond appropriately to changes in the user's state. Our experimental study shows that Brainput significantly improves several performance metrics, as well as the subjective NASA-Task Load Index scores in a dual-task human-robot activity."

Current approaches to automatic screen rotation are based on gravity and device orientation. Our survey of 513 users shows that 42% currently experience auto-rotation that leads to incorrect viewing orientation several times a week or more, and 24% find the problem to be very serious to extremely serious. iRotate augments gravity-based approach, and uses front cameras on mobile devices to detect users' faces and rotates screens accordingly. It requires no explicit user input and supports different user postures and device orientations. We have implemented a iRotate that works in real-time on iPhone and iPad, and we assess the accuracy and limitations of iRotate through a 20- participant feasibility study."

We describe a sensor fusion methodology that combines face tracking using a frontfacing camera with gyroscope data to produce a robust signal that defines the viewer's 3D position relative to the display. The gyroscopic data provides both low-latency feedback and allows extrapolation of the face position beyond the the fieldofview of the front-facing camera. We also demonstrate a hybrid position and rate control that uses the viewer&#65533;s 3D position to drive exploration of very large image spaces. We report on the efficacy of the hybrid control vs. position only control through a user study."

  "Abstract": "Touchscreen phones tend to require constant visual attention, thus not allowing eyes-free interaction. For users with visual impairment, or when occupied with another task that requires a user's visual attention, these phones can be difficult to use. Recently, marks initiating from the bezel, the physical touch-insensitive frame surrounding a touchscreen display, have been proposed as a method for eyes-free interaction. Due to the physical form factor of the mobile device, it is possible to access different parts of the bezel eyes-free. In this paper, we first studied the performance of different bezel menu layouts. Based on the results, we designed a bezel-based text entry application to gain insights into how bezel menus perform in a real-world application. From a longitudinal study, we found that the participants achieved 9.2 words per minute in situations requiring minimal visual attention to the screen. After only one hour of practice, the participants transitioned from novice to expert users. This shows that bezel menus can be adopted for realistic applications."

In this paper, we present a method to determine the relative orientation of proximate mobile devices using only the backside camera. We implemented this method as a service called Orienteer, which provides mobile device with the orientation of other proximate mobile devices. We demonstrate that orientation information can be used to enable novel and natural interactions by developing two applications that allow the user to push content in the direction of another device to share it and point the device toward another to filter content based on the device&#8217;s owner. An informal evaluation revealed that interactions built upon orientation information can be natural and compelling to users, but developers and designers need to carefully consider how orientation should be applied effectively."

  "Abstract": "We present Phone as a Pixel. a scalable, synchronization-free, platform-independent system for creating large, ad-hoc displays from a collection of smaller devices. In contrast to most tiled-display systems, the only requirement for participation is for devices to have an internet connection and a web browser. Thus, most smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices can be used. Phone as a Pixel uses a color-transition encoding scheme to identify and locate displays. This approach has several advantages. devices can be arbitrarily arranged (i.e., not in a grid) and infrastructure consists of a single conventional camera. Further, additional devices can join at any time without re-calibration. These are desirable properties to enable collective displays in contexts like sporting events, concerts and political rallies. In this paper we describe our system, show results from proof-of-concept setups, and quantify the performance of our approach on hundreds of displays."

  "Abstract": "Cognitive neuroscience defines the sense of agency as the experience of controlling one's own actions and, through this control, affecting the external world. We believe that the sense of personal agency is a key factor in how people experience interactions with technology. This paper draws on theoretical perspectives in cognitive neuroscience and describes two implicit methods through which personal agency can be empirically investigated. We report two experiments applying these methods to HCI problems. One shows that a new input modality - skin-based interaction - can substantially increase users' sense of agency. The second demonstrates that variations in the parameters of assistance techniques such as predictive mouse acceleration can have a significant impact on users' sense of agency. The methods presented provide designers with new ways of evaluating and refining empowering interaction techniques and interfaces, in which users experience an instinctive sense of control and ownership over their actions."

  "Abstract": "Rating interfaces are widely used on the Internet to elicit people's opinions. Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of these interfaces and their design space is relatively unexplored. We provide a taxonomy for the design space by identifying two axes. Measurement Scale for absolute rating vs. relative ranking, and Recall Support for the amount of information provided about previously recorded opinions. We present an exploration of the design space through iterative prototyping of three alternative interfaces and their evaluation. Among many findings, the study showed that users do take advantage of recall support in interfaces, preferring those that provide it. Moreover, we found that designing ranking systems is challenging; there may be a mismatch between a ranking interface that forces people to specify a total ordering for a set of items, and their mental model that some items are not directly comparable to each other."

  "Abstract": "Science in general, and biomedical research in particular, is becoming more collaborative. As a result, collaboration with the right individuals, teams and institutions is increasingly crucial for scientific progress. We propose \"research networking systems\" (RNS) as a new type of system designed to help scientists identify and choose collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research agenda covers four areas. Foundations, Presentation, Architecture and Evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institution- and discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks; and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies and folksonomies; the tension between seekers&#8217; need for comprehensive information and potential collaborators&#8217; desire to control how they are seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and synthesis of information from multiple sources, social system interoperability, and integration with the user&#8217;s primary work context. Lastly, Evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions, measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic methods. We hope that this paper stimulates the human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work and related communities to pursue a broad and comprehensive agenda for developing research networking systems"

  "Abstract": "Secure user authentication on mobile phones is crucial, as they store highly sensitive information. Common approaches to authenticate a user on a mobile phone are based either on entering a PIN, a password, or drawing a pattern. However, these authentication methods are vulnerable to the shoulder surfing attack. The risk of this attack has increased since means for recording high-resolution videos are cheaply and widely accessible. If the attacker can videotape the authentication process, PINs, passwords, and patterns do not even provide the most basic level of security. In this project, we assessed the vulnerability of a magnetic gestural authentication method to the video-based shoulder surfing attack. We chose a scenario that is favourable to the attack-er. In a real world environment, we videotaped the interactions of four users performing magnetic signatures on a phone, in the presence of HD cameras from four different angles. We then recruited 22 participants and asked them to watch the videos and try to forge the signatures. The results revealed that with a certain threshold, i.e, th=1.67, none of the forging attacks was successful, whereas at this level all eligible login attempts were successfully recognized. The qualitative feedback also indicated that users found the magnetic gestural signature authentication method to be more secure than PIN-based and 2D signature methods."

  "Abstract": "Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability among adults in industrialized nations; approximately 80% of people who survive a stroke experience motor disabilities. Recovery requires hundreds of daily repetitions of therapeutic exercises, often without therapist supervision. When performing therapy alone, people with limited motion often compensate for the lack of motion in one joint by moving another one. This compensation can impede the recovery progress and create new health problems. In this work we contribute (1) a methodology to reliably sense compensatory torso motion in the context of shoulder exercises done by persons with stroke and (2) the design and experimental evaluation of operant-conditioning-based strategies for games that aim to reduce compensatory torso motion. Our results show that these strategies significantly reduce compensatory motions compared to alternatives."

  "Abstract": "In this paper we describe visitor interaction with an interactive tabletop exhibit on evolution that we designed for use in natural history museums. We video recorded 30 families using the exhibit at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. We also observed an additional 50 social groups interacting with the exhibit without video recording. The goal of this research is to explore ways to develop 'successful' interactive tabletop exhibits for museums. To determine criteria for success in this context, we borrow the concept of Active Prolonged Engagement (APE) from the science museum literature. Research on APE sets a high standard for visitor engagement and learning, and it offers a number of useful concepts and measures for research on interactive surfaces in the wild. In this paper we adapt and expand on these measures and apply them to our tabletop exhibit. Our results show that visitor groups collaborated effectively and engaged in focused, on-topic discussion for prolonged periods of time. To understand these results, we analyze visitor conversation at the exhibit. Our analysis suggests that social practices of game play contributed substantially to visitor collaboration and engagement with the exhibit."

Instead, they began to question, analyze, and make hypotheses about the data presented. However, striking a meaningful balance between 'true' history and imagined events poses new design challenges. We present a formative typology of counterfactual design patterns that can help designers, educators, and players locate interesting fault lines in reality that facilitate the expansion of ARG mythologies."

Adapting to a shifting cast of children, context and mediating activities requires CLS's to be experts at a kind of articulation work. This expertise means CLS's are well equipped to help technologists introduce child-facing interventions to the hospital. We conducted participatory design activities with 9 CLS's to develop two mobile systems to explore how CLS-child interactions are shaped by activities. We observed 18 child-CLS pairs using these systems in a hospital setting. By analyzing these encounters, we describe a continuum for classifying activities as either Co-Present or Collaborative. We then introduce a framework, Activity-Based Interaction, to describe structural components of activities that impact their position on this continuum. These concepts suggest new approaches to designing mediating technologies for adults and children."

We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity. Second, reflecting on physical activity and context can increase people&#8217;s awareness of opportunities for physical activity. Lastly, automated tracking of physical activity and contextual information benefits long-term reflection, but may have detrimental effects on immediate awareness."

We identify the potential benefits of uncomfortable interactions under the general headings of entertainment, enlightenment and sociality. We then review artworks and performances that have employed discomfort, including two complementary examples from the worlds of entertainment and performance. From this, we articulate a suite of tactics for designing four primary forms of discomfort referred to as visceral, cultural, control and intimate. We discuss how moments of discomfort need to be embedded into an overall experience which requires a further consideration of the dramatic acts of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and d&#65533;nouement. Finally, we discuss an ethical framework for uncomfortable interactions which leads us to revisit key issues of consent, withdrawal, privacy and risk."

In this paper, we argue that it is not feasible to design one interface that appeals to all users of an increasingly global audience. Instead, we propose to design culturally adaptive systems, which automatically generate personalized interfaces that correspond to cultural preferences. In an evaluation of one such system, we demonstrate that a majority of international participants preferred their personalized versions over a non-adapted interface of the same web site. Results show that users were 22% faster using the culturally adapted interface, needed less clicks, and made fewer errors, in line with subjective results demonstrating that they found the adapted version significantly easier to use. Our findings show that interfaces that adapt to cultural preferences can immensely increase the user experience."

  "Abstract": "This paper builds on the recent CHI2011 SIG on Digital Arts and the work of the author to examine the nature of collaboration between HCI researchers and new media (or digital) artists. We look at three particular collaborative projects spread over a number of years. We examine the lessons for future collaboration so that productive CHI Arts collaborations can flourish to sustain the community. The chief lessons are that such partnerships need; to early and ongoing collaboration between the parties in order to develop mutually agreeable goals, and that practices and techniques on both sides need to develop to support further understanding."

  "Abstract": "As users continue to grow in number and diversity, end-user programming is playing an increasingly central role in shaping software to meet the broad, varied, rapidly changing needs of the world. Numerous companies have therefore begun to sell tools enabling end users to create programs. In parallel, ongoing academic research is aimed at helping end-user programmers create and adapt new kinds of programs in new ways. This special interest group meeting will bring together the community of researchers and companies focused on creating end-user programming tools, thereby facilitating technology transfer and future collaboration."

  "Abstract": "The HCI research community grows bigger each year, refining and expanding its boundaries in new ways. The ability to effectively review submissions is critical to the growth of CHI and related conferences. The review process is designed to produce a consistent supply of fair, high-quality reviews without overloading individual reviewers; yet, after each cycle, concerns are raised about limitations of the process. Every year, participants are left wondering why their papers were not accepted (or why they were). This SIG will explore reviewing through a critical and constructive lens, discussing current successes and future opportunities in the CHI review process. Goals will include actionable conclusions about ways to improve the system, potential alternative peer models, and the creation of materials to educate newcomer reviewers."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1861",
  "Authors": ["Helen Petrie", "Christopher Power"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of York"],
  "Abstract": "Expert evaluation methods, such as heuristic evaluation, are still popular in spite of numerous criticisms of their effectiveness. This paper investigates the usability problems found in the evaluation of six highly interactive websites by 30 users in a task-based evaluation and 14 experts using three different expert evaluation methods. A grounded theory approach was taken to categorize 935 usability problems from the evaluation. Four major categories emerged. Physical presentation, Content, Information Architecture and Interactivity. Each major category had between 5 and 16 sub-categories. The categories and sub-categories were then analysed for whether they were found by users only, experts only or both users and experts. This allowed us to develop an evidence-based set of 21 heuristics to assist in the development and evaluation of interactive websites."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper134",
  "Authors": ["Anders Bruun", "Jan Stage"],
  "Affiliations": ["Aalborg University"],
  "Abstract": "Remote asynchronous usability testing involves users directly in reporting usability problems. Most studies of this approach employ predefined tasks to ensure that users experience specific aspects of the system, whereas other studies use no task assignments. Yet the effect of using predefined tasks is still to be uncovered. There is also limited research on instructions for users in identifying usability problems. This paper reports from a comparative study of the effect of task assignments and instruction types on the problems identified in remote asynchronous usability testing of a website for information retrieval, involving 53 prospective users. The results show that users solving predefined tasks identified significantly more usability problems with a significantly higher level of agreement than those working on their own authentic tasks. Moreover, users that were instructed by means of examples of usability problems identified significantly more usability problems than those who received a conceptual definition of usability problems."

  "Abstract": "Analysis is a key part of conducting usability evaluations, yet rarely systematically studied. Thus, we lack direction on how to do research on supporting practitioners' analysis and lose an opportunity for practitioners to learn from each other. We have surveyed 155 usability practitioners on the analysis in their latest usability evaluation. Analysis is typically flexible and light-weight. At the same time, practitioners see a need to strengthen reliability in evaluation. Redesign is closely integrated with analysis; more than half of the respondents provide visual redesign suggestions in their evaluation deliverables. Analysis support from academic research, including tools, forms and structured formats, does not seem to have direct impact on analysis practice. We provide six recommendations for future research to better support analysis."

  "Abstract": "We introduce a new usability walkthrough method called Collaborative Critique (CC), which is inspired by the human-computer collaboration paradigm of system-user interaction. This method applies a ``collaboration lens' to assessing the system's behavior and its impact on the user's efforts in the context of the task being performed. We present findings from a laboratory evaluation of the CC method with usability practitioners, in which the results of the CC walkthrough were compared to a benchmark set of problems collected via user testing with two experimental Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system tasks. The development of this new usability evaluation method was driven by the need for an approach that assesses the adequacy of the system's support for reducing the user's cognitive and physical effort in the context of the interaction."

  "Key": "paper1926",
  "Authors": ["Jakob Tholander", "Maria Normark", "Chiara Rossitto"],
  "Affiliations": ["Mobile Life, Stockholm University", "Mobile Life Centre", "Stockholm University"],
  "Abstract": "We draw on the concept of agency in order to understand the process of how design materials 'talk back' to designers. In so doing, we illustrate the various levels at which agency can emerge in the context of intensive short-time prototyping sessions. In HCI, it is often assumed that the designer is the agent that acts intentionally in the design process. Contrary to this, recent notions of agency provide a way of analysing the performative role of design materials as intra-actions between components within a given phenomenon, rather than as meanings merely ascribed by actions of designers. The notion of agency puts focus on the emerging properties of materials and how they actively contribute to the way that design activity unfolds. The analyses showed how interaction design is to a large extent driven by emergent characteristics of available materials. The results have implications for understanding material interactions and materiality in interaction design."

  "Authors": ["Sebastian Denef", "David Keyson"],
  "Affiliations": ["Fraunhofer FIT", "TU Delft"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper we present our approach to capture and share knowledge from field studies using pattern language and thereby inform the design of ubiquitous computing. In our case, we studied frontline firefighting by observing the existing practice, by developing empathy through participation and by introducing new technology as triggering artifacts. Applying grounded theory, we distilled our findings into pattern language describing core aspects of this practice and their interaction. In a workshop, we introduced the pattern language to developers who had no previous knowledge of this practice and, in follow-up interviews, confronted them with new technology proposals for firefighters. Our study shows that pattern language, while not to be confused with an immutable description of the status quo or a direct path from contextual analysis to design, supports a reflective discussion of novel technology and the fit with and potential impact on existing practice."

Despite advancements in web browser and image processing, the act of animation building is still considered a solitary activity. A design challenge. Can animation building become accessible to a general audience if it becomes a social activity? Volley is a concept design for a web application that enables users to collectively share, edit, and animate images. We created a design framework for an online community and animation tool that supports meaningful social collaborations and desirable, new animated works."

  "Abstract": "This paper describes the relationship between industrial design and interaction design in product development activities based on a case study. The case study is grounded on a specific product's design and development activity. This study shows that the most intense collaboration takes place in early phases of the development activity such as concept generation and creation of design alternatives. This study also shows that there are differences in terms of methods, techniques and design languages in approaching the design problem, understanding users between industrial designers and interaction designers. Therefore conducting more case studies regarding this result might contribute to develop thriving techniques, design and representation languages."

This technique can be applied in personalization and ranking of search results, and has the potential to reveal relevant factors in other domains."

  "Abstract": "Children have great facility in the physical world, and can skillfully model in clay and draw expressive illustrations. Traditional digital modeling tools have focused on mouse, keyboard and stylus input. These tools may be complicated and difficult for young users to easily and quickly create exciting designs. We seek to bring physical interaction to digital modeling, to allow users to use existing physical objects as tangible building blocks for new designs. We introduce KidCAD a digital clay interface for children to remix toys. KidCAD allows children to imprint 2.5D shapes from physical objects into their digital models by deforming a malleable gel input device, deForm. Users can mashup existing objects, edit and sculpt or draw new designs on a 2.5D canvas using physical objects, hands and tools as well as 2D touch gestures. We report on a preliminary user study with 13 children, ages 7 to 10, which provides feedback for our design and helps guide future work in tangible modeling for children."

Instead of the prevailing approach of pasting ``information bubbles'' onto the existing urban scenery, ClayVision communicates through real-time 3D transformations of city elements. In other words, the system dynamically probes and reassembles the city into a better-designed copy of the original, that is both easier to navigate and tailored to suit the user's needs and preferences. We provide extensive discussions that cover the technical details of the system, the types of city-morphing operations that can be effectively applied, and what people's experiences will be in the newly ``elastic'' city."

  "Authors": ["Otmar Hilliges", "David Kim", "Shahram Izadi", "Malte Weiss", "Andrew Wilson"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research", "Newcastle University", "RWTH Aachen University"],
  "Abstract": "HoloDesk is an interactive system combining an optical see through display and Kinect camera to create the illusion that users are directly interacting with 3D graphics. A virtual image of a 3D scene is rendered through a half silvered mirror and spatially aligned with the real-world for the viewer. Users easily reach into an interaction volume displaying the virtual image. This allows the user to literally get their hands into the virtual display and to directly interact with an spatially aligned 3D virtual world, without the need for any specialized head-worn hardware or input device. We introduce a new technique for interpreting raw Kinect data to approximate and track rigid (e.g., books, cups) and non-rigid (e.g., hands, paper) physical objects and support a variety of physics-inspired interactions between virtual and real. In particular the algorithm models natural human grasping of virtual objects with more fidelity than previously demonstrated. A qualitative study highlights rich emergent 3D interactions, using hands and real-world objects. The implementation of HoloDesk is described in full, and example application scenarios explored. Finally, HoloDesk is quantitatively evaluated in a 3D target acquisition task, comparing the system with indirect and glasses-based variants."

We introduce mechanisms for interacting with these physical stacks for access and manipulation of information using asymmetric bi-manual interactions, such as providing contextual overviews. Initial user experiences indicate a preference for linear overlaps as a stacking configuration."

This paper explores how corporate career presences on network sites should be realized in order to attract potential applicants. Therefore, we tested the impact of seven individual characteristics (namely Appointments, Daily Working Routine, Jobs, Corporate News, Entertainment, Media Format, and Features) of these corporate career presences that we extracted by a comprehensive pre-study on users' perceived hedonic and utilitarian value of these presences on social network sites. Based on an online survey with 470 participants, the results reveal a highly significant impact of five characteristics that corporate career presences provide both a hedonic as well as a utilitarian value to the user."

  "Authors": ["Nicholas Diakopoulos", "Munmun De Choudhury", "Mor Naaman"],
  "Affiliations": ["Rutgers University"],
  "Abstract": "Social media is already a fixture for reporting for many journalists, especially around breaking news events where non-professionals may already be on the scene to share an eyewitness report, photo, or video of the event. At the same time, the huge amount of content posted in conjunction with such events serves as a challenge to finding interesting and trustworthy sources in the din of the stream. In this paper we develop and investigate new methods for filtering and assessing the verity of sources found through social media by journalists. We take a human centered design approach to developing a system, SRSR ('Seriously Rapid Source Review'), informed by journalistic practices and knowledge of information production in events. We then used the system, together with a realistic reporting scenario, to evaluate the filtering and visual cue features that we developed. Our evaluation offers insights into social media information sourcing practices and challenges, and highlights the role technology can play in the solution."

However, it is unclear how useful different types of information are for people to make expertise judgments and to what extent their background knowledge influences their judgments. This study explored differences between experts and novices in inferring expertise of Twitter users. In three conditions, participants rated the level of expertise of users after seeing (1) only the tweets, (2) only the contextual information including short biographical and user list information, and (3) both tweets and contextual information. Results indicated that, in general, contextual information provides more useful information for making expertise judgment of Twitter users than tweets. While the addition of tweets seems to make little difference, or even add nuances to novices&#65533; expertise judgment, experts&#65533; judgments were improved when both content and contextual information were presented."

  "Abstract": "We present Tome, a novel framework that helps developers quantitatively evaluate user interfaces and design iterations by using histories from crowds of end users. Tome collects user-interaction histories via an interface instrumentation library as end users complete tasks; these histories are compiled using the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) into task completion-time predictions using CogTool. With many histories, Tome can model prevailing strategies for tasks without needing an HCI specialist to describe users' interaction steps. An unimplemented design change can be evaluated by perturbing a Tome task model in CogTool to reflect the change, giving a new performance prediction. We found that predictions for quick (5-60s) query tasks in an instrumented brain-map interface averaged within 10% of measured expert times. Finally, we modified a Tome model to predict closely the speed-up yielded by a proposed interaction before implementing it."

Built within CogTool so it is easy to represent UI layouts, run the model, and present results, CTE1.2's vision is to assess many design ideas at the storyboard stage before implementation and without the cost of running human participants. This paper evaluates CTE1.2 predictions against observed human behavior on 108 tasks (36 tasks on 3 distinct website layouts). CTE1.2's predictions accounted for 63-82% of the variance in the percentage of participants succeeding on each task, the number of clicks to success, and the percentage of participants succeeding without error. We demonstrate how these predictions can be used to identify areas of the UI in need of redesign."

A model using diffused illumination captures performed well when augmented with a forearm rectangle, as did a modified circle and rectangle model with ellipse 'fingers' suitable when only X-Y contact positions are available. Finally, we describe the corpus of detailed multi-touch input data we generated which is available to the community."

In a preliminary study, we identified five holds that permit simultaneous support and interaction, and noted that users frequently change position to combat fatigue. We then designed the BiTouch design space, which introduces a support function in the kinematic chain model for interacting with hand-held tablets, and developed BiPad, a toolkit for creating bimanual tablet interaction with the thumb or the fingers of the supporting hand. We ran a controlled experiment to explore how tablet orientation and hand position affect three novel techniques. bimanual taps, gestures and chords. Bimanual taps outperformed our one-handed control condition in both landscape and portrait orientations; bimanual chords and gestures in portrait mode only; and thumbs outperformed fingers, but were more tiring and less stable. Together, BiTouch and BiPad offer new opportunities for designing bimanual interaction on hand-held tablets."

We present two new two-handed multistroke marking menu variants in which users either draw strokes with both hands simultaneously or alternate strokes between hands. In a pair of studies we find that using two hands simultaneously is faster than using a single, dominant-handed marking menu by 10-15%. Alternating strokes between hands doubles the number of accessible menu items for the same number of strokes, and is similar in performance to using a one-handed marking menu. We also examine how stroke direction affects performance. When using thumbs on an iPod Touch, drawing strokes upwards and inwards is faster than other directions. For two-handed simultaneous menus, stroke pairs that are bilaterally symmetric or share the same direction are fastest. We conclude with design guidelines and sample applications to aid multitouch application developers interested in using one- and two-handed marking menus."

Captured images are uploaded to a BinCam application on Facebook where they can be explored by all users of the BinCam system. Engagement with BinCam is designed to fit into the existing structure of users' everyday life, with the intention that reflection on waste and recycling becomes a playful and shared group activity. Results of a user study reveal an increase in both users' awareness of, and reflection about, their waste management and their motivation to improve their waste-related skills. With BinCam, we also explore informational and normative social influences as a source of change (e.g., socially evoked feelings of 'guilt' for non-recycling or food disposal), which has to date been underexplored in persuasive HCI. Design implications for reflection and social persuasion are proposed."

  "Abstract": "Recent focus on sustainability has made consumers more aware of our joint responsibility for conserving energy resources such as electricity. However, reducing electricity use can be difficult with only a meter and a monthly or annual electricity bill. With the emergence of new power meters units, information on electricity consumption is now available digitally and wirelessly. This enables the design and deployment of a new class of persuasive systems giving consumers insight into their use of energy resources and means for reducing it. In this paper, we explore the design and use of one such system, Power Advisor, promoting electricity conservation through tailored information on a mobile phone or tablet. The use of the system in 10 households was studied over 7 weeks. Findings provide insight into peoples awareness of electricity consumption in their home and how this may be influenced through design."

  "Abstract": "The design of technological interventions to motivate behaviour-based reductions in end-user energy consumption has recently been identified as a priority for the HCI community. Previous interventions have produced promising results, but have typically focused on domestic energy consumption. By contrast, this paper focuses on the workplace context, which presents very different opportunities and challenges. For instance, financial consequences, which have proved successful as motivations in the domestic environment, are not present in the workplace in the context of employees. We describe the outcome of a sequence of workshops that focussed on understanding employee perceptions of energy use in the workplace, with the locus of activity on energy intervention design. Using a grounded theory analysis, we produced a framework of key themes detailing user perceptions and energy intervention design considerations. Our findings provide a framework of considerations for the design of successful workplace energy interventions."

  "Abstract": "Few means currently exist for home occupants to learn about their water consumption. e.g., where water use occurs, whether such use is excessive and what steps can be taken to conserve. Emerging water sensing systems, however, can provide detailed usage data at the level of individual water fixtures (i.e., disaggregated usage data). In this paper, we perform formative evaluations of two sets of novel eco-feedback displays that take advantage of this disaggregated data. The first display set isolates and examines specific elements of an eco-feedback design space such as data and time granularity. Displays in the second set act as design probes to elicit reactions about competition, privacy, and integration into domestic space. The displays were evaluated via an online survey of 651 North American respondents and in-home, semi-structured interviews with 10 families (20 adults). Our findings are relevant not only to the design of future water eco-feedback systems but also for other types of consumption (e.g., electricity and gas)."

  "Abstract": "Involving children in the design process of interactive technology can greatly enhance its likelihood of successful adoption. However, children's input and ideas require careful interpretation to reach viable designs and technical specifications, which poses a significant challenge to an adult design research team. In this paper we discuss our approach to managing the complexity of combining concepts and ideas that were generated through participatory design work with the practical, technical, ethical and theoretical constraints of developing a technologically enhanced learning environment for children with and without Autism Spectrum Conditions. We found that the nature of this design problem did not lend itself to be rationally reduced to produce a single solution, but required an understanding of interpretive and speculative approaches for us to be able to cope with the complexity of requirements. We describe a workshop in which members of the design team used such approaches to develop a design brief that is faithful to the children's input. By making this process transparent, we aim to contribute to the methodology of using such designerly approaches in combination with participatory and human-centred methods to develop interactive technology."

  "Abstract": "Consumer-based synchronous video communication is on the rise and is viewed as a valuable medium to support long distance relationships. We were interested in the potential of asynchronous video to augment children&#65533;s close friendships and what types of activities they would engage in using video. We explored both of these concepts through a 9-week field study with a group of six 9-10 year old girls. We see children as potential media trendsetters when it comes to video communication given their comfort with video and desire for rich social interactions. The results from this study were striking. Despite having frequent face-to-face interactions, the girls used our asynchronous video communication tool extensively to augment their existing relationships. Not only were they able to have rich conversations using asynchronous video, they also demonstrated a strong desire to share more than just a &#65533;talking head&#65533;. The results from this work point to the need for video mediated communication to move beyond conversations, to the sharing of rich experiences."

Blind users cannot use visual CAPTCHAs, and it has been documented in the research literature that the existing audio CAPTCHAs have task success rates below 50% for blind users. The SoundsRight audio CAPTCHA presents a real-time audio-based challenge in which the user is asked to identify a specific sound (for example the sound of a bell or a piano) each time it occurs in a series of 10 sounds that are played through the computer&#65533;s audio system. Evaluation results from three rounds of usability testing document that the task success rate was higher than 90% for blind users. Discussion, limitations, and suggestions for future research are also presented."

  "Authors": ["Anuj Kumar", "Tim Paek", "Bongshin Lee"],
  "Affiliations": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Dictation using speech recognition could potentially serve as an efficient input method for touchscreen devices. However, dictation systems today follow a mentally disruptive speech interaction model. users must first formulate utterances and then produce them, as they would with a voice recorder. Because utterances do not get transcribed until users have finished speaking, the entire output appears and users must break their train of thought to verify and correct it. In this paper, we introduce Voice Typing, a new speech interaction model where users&#8217; utterances are transcribed as they produce them to enable real-time error identification. For fast correction, users leverage a marking menu using touch gestures. Voice Typing aspires to create an experience akin to having a secretary type for you, while you monitor and correct the text. In a user study where participants composed emails using both Voice Typing and traditional dictation, they not only reported lower cognitive demand for Voice Typing but also exhibited 29% relative reduction of user corrections. Overall, they also preferred Voice Typing."

Largely taken for granted in everyday interface design, the typographical component, through its legibility and aesthetics, weighs heavily on the ubiquitous reading task at the heart of most visualizations and interactions. In this paper, we present a research project whose goal is the creation of a new typeface to display textual information on future aircraft interfaces. After an initial task analysis leading to the definition of specific needs, requirements and design principles, the design constantly evolves from an iterative cycle of design and experimentation. We present three experiments (laboratory and cockpit) used mainly to validate initial choices and fine-tune font properties. Results confirm the importance of rigorously testing the typographical component as a part of text output evaluation in interactive systems."

  "Authors": ["David Flatla", "Carl Gutwin"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Saskatchewan"],
  "Abstract": "Color is commonly used to convey information in digital environments, but colors can be difficult to distinguish for many users &#65533; either because of a congenital color vision deficiency (CVD), or because of situation-induced CVDs such as wearing colored glasses or working in sunlight. Tools intended to improve color differentiability (recoloring tools) exist, but these all use abstract models of only a few types of congenital CVD; if the user&#65533;s color problems have a different cause, existing recolorers can perform poorly. We have developed a recoloring tool (SSMRecolor) based on the idea of situation-specific modeling &#65533; in which we build a performance-based model of a particular user in their specific environment, and use that model to drive the recoloring process. SSMRecolor covers a much wider range of CVDs, including acquired and situational deficiencies. We evaluated SSMRecolor and two existing tools in a controlled study of people&#65533;s color-matching performance in several environmental conditions. The study included participants with and without congenital CVD. Our results show both accuracy and response time in color-matching tasks were significantly better with SSMRecolor. This work demonstrates the value of a situation-specific approach to recoloring, and shows that this technique can substantially improve the usability of color displays for users of all types."

When societies experience disruption as caused by natural disasters, various official government agencies, relief organizations, and emergent citizen groups aid in the recovery effort&#8212;where normal societal function resumes. In war environments however, societal trust can be affected and people may develop distrust of the institutions and associated individuals that provide and repair infrastructure. We show how citizens used ICTs to repair infrastructure during ongoing disruption caused by conflict by creating new, reliable technology-mediated social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel, education and obtaining information. We then discuss new ways to think about infrastructure, as well as implications for the disaster relief effort."

  "Abstract": "Emergency Communication Systems (ECS) are a key element in collaborations among different public safety organizations. The need for interoperability in emergency communication systems has hastened the development of interoperable communication technology that is an enabling technology to automatically identify environmental variables including appropriate radio frequencies and to connect different networks used by different organizations. Even though the technology has been researched from many perspectives and has shown the possibility to connect different organizations, there still remain many issues in terms of socio-cognitive aspects. Thus, this study examines the socio-cognitive dimensions of interoperability, which equal the technical dimensions of the problem in importance. The existential-phenomenological study reported here used semi-structured interviews to reconceptualize interoperability in the public safety communication domain. Based on 11 interviews with public safety workers, five important factors were identified that have a major impact on the effectiveness of interoperable groups. information sharedness, operational awareness, communication readiness, adaptiveness, and coupledness. Based on these main concepts, high-level suggestions are provided to guide the design of a new public safety communication system. The results can be directly applied to identify the requirements of communication systems and can be extended to design collaboration systems under stressful environments."

  "Authors": ["Niels Henze", "Enrico Rukzio", "Susanne Boll"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Oldenburg", "University of Duisburg-Essen"],
  "Abstract": "With the rise of current smartphones, virtual keyboards for touchscreens became the dominant mobile text entry technique. We developed a typing game that records how users touch on the standard Android keyboard to investigate users' typing behaviour. 47,770,625 keystrokes from 72,945 installations have been collected by publishing the game. By visualizing the touch distribution we identified a systematic skew and derived a function that compensates this skew by shifting touch events. By updating the game we conduct an experiment that investigates the effect of shifting touch events, changing the keys' labels, and visualizing the touched position. Results based on 6,603,659 keystrokes and 13,013 installations show that visualizing the touched positions using a simple dot decreases the error rate of the Android keyboard by 18.3% but also decreases the speed by 5.2% with no positive effect on learnability. The Android keyboard outperforms the control condition but the constructed shift function further improves the performance by 2.2% and decreases the error rate by 9.1%. We argue that the shift function can improve existing keyboards at no costs."

  "Authors": ["Mark Dunlop", "John Levine"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Strathclyde"],
  "Abstract": "This paper presents a new optimization technique for keyboard layouts based on Pareto front optimization. We used this multifactorial technique to create two new touchscreen phone keyboard layouts based on three design metrics. minimizing finger travel distance in order to maximize text entry speed, a new metric to maximize the quality of spell correction by reducing tap ambiguity, and maximizing familiarity through a similarity function with the standard Qwerty layout. The paper describes the optimization process and resulting layouts for a standard trapezoid shaped keyboard and a more rectangular layout. Fitts' law modelling shows a predicted 11% improvement in entry speed without taking into account the significantly improved error correction potential and the subsequent effect on speed. In initial user tests typing speed dropped from approx. 21 wpm with Qwerty to 13 wpm (64%) on first use of our layout but recovered to 18 wpm (85%) within four short trial sessions, and was still improving. NASA TLX forms showed no significant difference on load between Qwerty and our new layout use in the fourth session. Together we believe this shows the new layouts are faster and can be quickly adopted by users."

  "Authors": ["Leah Findlater", "Ben Lee", "Jacob O Wobbrock"],

  "Abstract": "Although many techniques have been proposed to improve text input on touch screens, the vast majority of this research ignores non-alphanumeric input (i.e., punctuation, symbols, and modifiers). To support this input, widely adopted commercial touch-screen interfaces require mode switches to alternate keyboard layouts for most punctuation and symbols. Our approach is to augment existing ten-finger QWERTY keyboards with multi-touch gestural input that can exist as a complement to the moded-keyboard approach. To inform our design, we conducted a study to elicit user-defined gestures from 20 participants. The final gesture set includes both multi-touch and single-touch gestures for commonly used non-alphanumeric text input. We implemented and conducted a preliminary evaluation of a touch-screen keyboard augmented with this technique. Findings show that using gestures for non-alphanumeric input is no slower than using keys, and that users strongly prefer gestures to a moded-keyboard interface."

  "Abstract": "Mobile touch devices have become increasingly popular, yet typing on virtual keyboards whilst walking is still an overwhelming task. In this paper we analyze; firstly, the negative effect of walking on text-input performance, particularly the users' main difficulties and error patterns. We focused our research on thumb typing, since this is a commonly used technique to interact with touch interfaces. Secondly, we analyze how these effects can be compensated by two-hand interaction and increasing target size. We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape). Results show that independently of hand condition, mobility significantly decreased input quality, leading to specific error patterns. Moreover, it was shown that target size can compensate the negative effect of walking, while two-hand interaction does not provide additional stability or input accuracy. We finish with implications for future designs."

  "Abstract": "The lack of tactile feedback on touch screens makes typing difficult, a challenge exacerbated when situational impairments like walking vibration and divided attention arise in mobile settings. We introduce WalkType, an adaptive text entry system that leverages the mobile device&#65533;s built-in tri-axis accelerometer to compensate for extraneous movement while walking. WalkType&#65533;s classification model uses the displacement and acceleration of the device, and inference about the user&#65533;s footsteps. Additionally, WalkType models finger-touch location and finger distance traveled on the screen, features that increase overall accuracy regardless of movement. The final model was built on typing data collected from 16 participants. In a study comparing WalkType to a control condition, WalkType reduced uncorrected errors by 45.2% and increased typing speed by 12.9% for walking participants."

We take a series of questions as a joint point of departure to consider the nature and character of &#65533;material interactions&#65533; in HCI. Specifically, we consider theoretical, critical and practical approaches to material interactions and how they inform/become useful to HCI. The panel will include position statements from the panelists as well as high-level audience participation. We envision a fun and intellectually stimulating panel moderated by Prof. Mikael Wiberg consisting of a number of scholars with a well-developed view on digital materialities to fuel a discussion on material interactions - from atoms & bits to entangled practices. These scholars include. Prof. Hiroshi Ishii, Prof. Paul Dourish, Daniela Rosner, Petra Sundstr&#65533;m, Anna Vallg&#65533;rda and Tobie Kerridge.

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1283",
  "Authors": ["Stephen Oney", "Joel Brandt"],
  "Affiliations": ["Carnegie Mellon University", "Adobe Systems"],
  "Abstract": "Programmers frequently use instructive code examples found on the Web to overcome cognitive barriers while programming. These examples couple the concrete functionality of code with rich contextual information about how the code works. However, using these examples necessitates understanding, configuring, and integrating the code, all of which typically take place after the example enters the user's code and has been removed from its original instructive context. In short, a user's interaction with an example continues well after the code is pasted. This paper investigates whether treating examples as 'first-class' objects in the code editor - rather than simply as strings of text - will allow programmers to use examples more effectively. We explore this through the creation and evaluation of Codelets. A Codelet is presented inline with the user's code, and consists of a block of example code and an interactive helper widget that assists the user in understanding and integrating the example. The Codelet persists throughout the example's lifecycle, remaining accessible even after configuration and integration is done. A comparative laboratory study with 20 participants found that programmers were able to complete tasks involving examples an average of 43% faster when using Codelets than when using a standard Web browser."

  "Abstract": "Implementing secure code is an important and oft-overlooked non-functional requirement. Secure programming errors are a subset of program errors that result in many common privacy and security breaches in commercial software. We are seeking to provide interactive support for secure programming in the development environment. In this paper, we have evaluated our prototype tool, ASIDE, which provides real-time warnings and code generation to reduce secure programming errors introduced by programmers. We evaluate the potential use and effectiveness of ASIDE on both novice and professional developers in two comparison user studies. Our results demonstrate that the interactive support can help address this important non-functional requirement, and suggest guidelines for such tools to support programmers."

  "Abstract": "General-purpose software applications are usually not tailored for a specific user with specific tasks, strategies or preferences. In order to achieve optimal performance with such applications, users typically need to transition to an alternative efficient behavior. Often, features of such alternative behaviors are not initially accessible and first need to be customized. However, few research works formally study and empirically measure what drives a user to customize. In this paper, we describe the challenges involved in empirically studying customization behaviors, and propose a methodology for formally measuring the impact of potential customization factors. We then demonstrate this methodology by studying the impact of different customization factors on customization behaviors. Our results show that increasing exposure and awareness of customization features, and adding social influence can significantly affect the user's customization behavior."

  "Abstract": "Despite decades of research into how professional programmers debug, only recently has work emerged about how end-user programmers attempt to debug programs. Without this knowledge, we cannot build tools to adequately support their needs. This paper reports the results of a detailed qualitative empirical study of end-user programmers&#8217; sensemaking about a spreadsheet&#8217;s correctness. Using our study&#8217;s data, we derived a sensemaking model for end-user debugging and categorized participants&#8217; activities and verbalizations according to this model, allowing us to investigate how participants went about debugging. Among the results are identification of the prevalence of information foraging during end-user debugging, two successful strategies for traversing the sensemaking model, potential ties to gender differences in the literature, sensemaking sequences leading to debugging progress, and sequences tied with troublesome points in the debugging process. The results also reveal new implications for the design of spreadsheet tools to support end-user programmers&#8217; sensemaking during debugging."

  "Abstract": "The 1&#8364; filter ('one Euro filter') is a simple algorithm to filter noisy signals for high precision and responsiveness. It uses a first order low-pass filter with an adaptive cutoff frequency. at low speeds, a low cutoff stabilizes the signal by reducing jitter, but as speed increases, the cutoff is increased to reduce lag. The algorithm is easy to implement, uses very few resources, and with two easily understood parameters, it is easy to tune. In a comparison with other filters, the 1&#8364; filter has less lag using a reference amount of jitter reduction."

  "Abstract": "In this paper, we present TeleHuman, a cylindrical 3D display portal for life-size human telepresence. The TeleHuman 3D videoconferencing system supports 360 degree motion parallax as the viewer moves around the cylinder and optionally, stereoscopic 3D display of the remote person. We evaluated the effect of perspective cues on the conveyance of nonverbal cues in two experiments using a one-way telecommunication version of the system. The first experiment focused on how well the system preserves gaze and hand pointing cues. The second experiment evaluated how well the system conveys 3D body postural information. We compared 3 perspective conditions. a conventional 2D view, a 2D view with 360 degree motion parallax, and a stereoscopic view with 360 degree motion parallax. Results suggest the combined presence of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues significantly improved the accuracy with which participants were able to assess gaze and hand pointing cues, and to instruct others on 3D body poses. The inclusion of motion parallax and stereoscopic cues also led to significant increases in the sense of social presence and telepresence reported by participants."

Multiple viewers are allowed to observe both the physical object(s) being augmented and their location dependent annotations at the same time. The system consists of two liquid-crystal (LC) panels within which physical objects can be placed. The back LC panel serves as a dynamic mask while the front panel serves as the data. We first describe the principle of MUSTARD and then examine various functions that can be used to minimize crosstalk between multiple viewer positions. We compare different conflict management strategies using PSNR and the quality mean opinion score of HDR-VDP2. Finally, through a user-study we show that users can clearly identify images and objects even when the images are shown with strong conflicting regions; demonstrating that our system works even in the most extreme of circumstances."

  "Abstract": "An emerging form of telecollaboration utilizes situated or mobile displays at a physical destination to virtually represent remote visitors. An example is a personal telepresence robot, which acts as a physical proxy for a remote visitor, and uses cameras and microphones to capture its surroundings, which are transmitted back to the visitor. We propose the use of spherical displays to represent telepresent visitors at a destination. We suggest that the use of such 360 degree displays in a telepresence system has two key advantages. it is possible to understand the identity of the visitor from any viewpoint; and with suitable graphical representation, it is possible to tell where the visitor is looking from any viewpoint. In this paper, we investigate how to optimally represent a visitor as an avatar on a spherical display by evaluating how varying representations are able to accurately convey head gaze."

Panoramas are typically visualized as rectangular photographs, but this does not provide clear cues for physical directions in the environment. In this paper, we conduct a series of studies with three different shapes. Frontal, Top-Down and Bird's Eye; the last two shapes are chosen be-cause they provide a clearer representation of the spatial mapping between panorama and environment. Our results show that good readability of the panorama is most important and that a clear representation of the spatial mapping plays a secondary role. This paper is the first to provide understanding on how users exploit 360&#176; panoramic over-views to locate objects in the surrounding environment and how different design factors can affect user performance."

  "Abstract": "User experience (UX) research on pervasive technologies faces considerable challenges regarding today's mobile context-sensitive applications. evaluative field studies lack control, whereas lab studies miss the interaction with a dynamic context. This dilemma has inspired researchers to use virtual environments (VEs) to acquire control while offering the user a rich contextual experience. Although promising, these studies are mainly concerned with usability and the technical realization of their setup. Furthermore, previous setups leave room for improvement regarding the user's immersive experience. This paper contributes to this line of research by presenting a UX case study on mobile advertising with a novel CAVE-smartphone interface. We conducted two experiments in which we evaluated the intrusiveness of a mobile location-based advertising app in a virtual supermarket. The results confirm our hypothesis that context-congruent ads lessen the experienced intrusiveness thereby demonstrating that our setup is capable of generating preliminary meaningful results with regards to UX. Furthermore, we share insights in conducting these studies."

  "Affiliations": ["Iowa State University"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper, we describe an experiment designed to evaluate the effectiveness of three interfaces for surveillance or remote control using live 360-degree video feeds from a person or vehicle in the field. Video feeds are simulated using a game engine. While locating targets within a 3D terrain using a 2D 360-degree interface, participants indicated perceived egocentric directions to targets and later placed targets on an overhead view of the terrain. Interfaces were compared based on target finding and map placement performance. Results suggest 1) non-seamless interfaces with visual boundaries facilitate spatial understanding, 2) correct perception of self-to-object relationships is not correlated with understanding object-to-object relationships within the environment, and 3) increased video game experience corresponds with better spatial understanding of an environment observed in 360-degrees. This work can assist researchers of panoramic video systems in evaluating the optimal interface for observation and teleoperation of remote systems."

  "Abstract": "Chronic headaches are one of the top five health problems for young children in the United States, negatively affecting their quality of life and learning opportunities. A clear understanding of children&#65533;s headache characteristics is crucial for delivering appropriate treatment. However, current data collection methods were designed for adults often resulting in insufficient information. In this paper we present a novel method to help children communicate with health care providers and researchers about their headaches. It augments an existing child-centric method called Draw-and-Tell Conversation, which has already been shown to provide more actionable information from children than standard data collection methods. It does so by enabling children to draw their symptoms on a zoomable drawing application, giving them the ability to provide more details and context than on paper. We present a study conducted with nineteen children aged 7 to 12 suggesting that children provided more information about their headaches when using the zoomable drawing application than when drawing on paper. This study provides a rare example of a mobile device used to enhance face-to-face interactions and contributes evidence of a specific benefit of zoomable user interfaces."

The station was designed through an iterative and incremental participatory design process involving medical professionals, game designers, computer scientists, kinesiologists, physical therapists, and eight children with CP. It has been tested through observation of its use, through gathering opinions from the children, and through small experimental studies. With our initial design, only three of eight children were capable of playing a cycling-based game; with the final design, seven of eight could cycle effectively, and six reached energy expenditure levels recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine while pedaling unassisted."

We deploy storytelling and theatrical strategies as a way of moving our thinking outside the familiar constraints of automotive design. These methods help us to extend the concept of a lifelog to consider the \"lives\" of objects and the relationship between humans and non-humans as fruitful areas of design research."

In doing so, the contribution of the paper is twofold. we wish to highlight some aspects of the every-day life of institutionalized elderly people &#65533; trust, sociality, and memory &#65533; which not only provoke reflection on design ideas but also on the socio-technical nexus in which design for the elderly has to take place. This domain, we suggest, is one where the &#65533;parachuting in&#65533; of technology is unlikely to prove successful, for reasons we examine below. Further, we suggest that design for and with the elderly carries with it some specific problems. We illustrate our methodological reflections by means of an ongoing empirical research project which aims at the development of a large-screen display for a residential care home."

  "Authors": ["Matthew Brehmer", "Joanna McGrenere", "Charlotte Tang", "Claudia Jacova"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of British Columbia"],
  "Abstract": "Interruptions in the home pose a threat to the validity of self-administered computerised cognitive testing. We report the findings of a laboratory experiment investigating the effects of increased interruption workload demand on older adults' computerised cognitive test performance. Related work has reported interruptions having a range of inhibitory and facilitatory effects on primary task performance. Cognitive ageing literature suggests that increased interruption workload demand should have greater detrimental effects on older adults' performance, when compared to younger adults. With 36 participants from 3 age groups (20-54, 55-69, 70+), we found divergent effects of increased interruption demand on two primary tasks. Results suggest that older and younger adults experience interruptions differently, but at no age is test performance compromised by demanding interruptions. This finding is reassuring with respect to the success of a self-administered computerised cognitive assessment test, and is likely to be useful for other applications used by older adults."

  "Abstract": "This paper introduces a voice-driven tool applied to an Initial Programming Environment (IPE), which gives motorically challenged individuals the opportunity to learn programming skills; in particular, our project allows programming by voice within Scratch. Although the native Scratch environment allows users to create a program by arranging graphical blocks logically, such visual languages are completely dependent on the use of a mouse and keyboard. This modality of interaction limits users based on physical abilities. Our solution is a tool, called Myna, which is a voice-driven Java application executed parallel to Scratch. Myna processes voice commands from the user, interprets those commands according to a pre-defined grammar, and simulates synonymous actions of a mouse and keyboard within Scratch. The resulting environment assists those with a motor disability (particularly young children) in learning the joy of programming. This extended abstract describes the motivation behind the project, a technical description of Myna, and defines the current work in progress."

  "Abstract": "Cool is an essential characteristic when designing technologies that appeal to teenagers, but is very challenging to understand and design for. This paper describes a study that investigated cool with teenagers using a specially constructed &#8216;Cool Wall&#8217; that allows items to be rated using a simple scale. We present the design of the Cool Wall prototype then the findings from two field studies in which it was used. The studies found that expensive mobile technologies were considered the most cool by teenagers participating in the studies, while items that are gender or age specific often divided opinion. This suggests that HCI practitioners wishing to &#8216;design for cool&#8217; need to carefully understand the their user groups, also that the cool wall described in this paper is one low-cost tool for providing insights into this understanding."

We designed an attractive multimedia tool, considering the family interaction, that uses eco-visualizations, a narrative and cartoon characters. If successful, we would achieve better informed consumption of food and other natural resources, reinforcing positive attitudes within the family."

However, design principles for tangible environments and intelligent support are often at odds. To reconcile these differences, we employ a need validation methodology to understand student needs in an intelligent tangible learning environment. We found that students seek activities that provide them with feelings of discovery, inter-group competition, and an appropriate level of challenge. In addition, students value physical movement, interactivity, and perceived relevance to their learning objectives. We discuss design implications of these findings for combining the benefits of tangible learning and intelligent support systems."

In this paper we present a flexible subscription-based web tool for non-experts to create and manage citizen science campaigns. Using our system, people can author their own campaigns with no programming skills and development infrastructure. We evaluated a functional prototype of our system with three groups having genuine needs to develop and deploy their own mobile citizen science applications.

Our preliminary results demonstrate the educational values of the energy representations in the tool, and we also identify a design tension for map-related energy representations."

It allows users to work rapidly and intuitively at multiple levels of zooming views as their fingertip is hovering over the surface. We evaluated our technique in the context of target search and found that hover-based zoom interaction significantly outperforms the conventional touch-based zoom interaction and touch/hover-based zoom interaction in both objective and subjective measurements. users searched targets more than twice as fast as with the conventional touch-based zoom interaction in our experiment."

The call graph exploration tools significantly increased success rates in typical software maintenance tasks, and using Stacksplorer or Blaze significantly reduced task completion times compared to using the Call Hierarchy or Xcode."

Our advance is to consider how these emotions are perceived by other people, rather than what the target's internal state really is. Because such perception is subjective, we introduce the concept of using a collection of subjective external observations to objectively identify a fact. By treating the difference in perceived state as a probability distribution, we propose a computational model that describes the relationship between the perceived emotion and participants' key nonverbal behaviors, i.e. gaze and facial expressions. We also propose an evaluation method to assess the model by comparing the distributions estimated by using it with those of observers'.

  "Abstract": "Mechanix is a computer-assisted tutoring system for engineering students. It uses recognition of freehand sketches to provide instant, detailed, and formative feedback as a student progresses through each homework problem. By using recognition algorithms, the system allows students to solve free-body diagrams and truss problems as if they were using a pen and paper. However, the system currently provides little support for students to edit their drawings by using free hand sketches. Specifically, students may wish to delete part or the whole of a line or shape, and the natural response is to scribble that part of shape out. We developed a new method for integrating scribble gestures into a sketch recognition system. The algorithm automatically identifies and distinguishes scribble gestures from regular drawing input using three features. If the stroke is classified as a scribble, then the algorithm further decides which shape or which part of shape to be deleted. Instead of using slower brute-force methods, we use geometric-based linear-time algorithms which efficiently detect a scribble gesture and remove the intended shapes in real-time."

  "Abstract": "The past decade has witnessed an explosion in the size and availability of online audio-visual repositories, such as entertainment, news, or lectures. Summarization systems have the potential to provide significant assistance with navigating such repositories. Unfortunately, automatically-generated summaries often fall short of delivering the information needed by users. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that the natural language heuristics used to generate summaries are often optimized with respect to currently-used evaluation metrics. Such metrics simply score automatically-generated summaries against subjectively-classified gold standards without taking into account the usefulness of a summary in assisting a user achieve a certain goal or even overall summary coherence. We have previously shown that an immediate consequence of this problem is that even the most linguistically-complex summarization systems perform no better than basic heuristics, such as picking the longest sentences from a general-topic, spontaneous dialog, or the first few sentences from a news recording. Our hypothesis is that complex systems are in fact better, if measured properly. What is thus needed instead are evaluation metrics (and consequently, automatic summarizers) that incorporate features such as user preferences and task-orientation. For this, we propose an ecologically valid evaluation metric that determines the value of a summary when embedded in a task, rather than how closely a summary matches a gold standard."

From previous studies, the optical axis of the eye is estimated using two calibrated cameras and two light sources. To realize gaze tracking without user calibration, we must estimate the offsets between the optical and visual axes of the eyes. We propose a method for estimating these offsets automatically. We use a particle filter to calculate the offsets based on the fact that true offsets make no distinction between the points of gaze (POGs) that are calculated from the optical axes of the eyes, irrespective of where the user gazes on the display. We evaluated the proposed method by simulation. Furthermore, we developed a prototype system, which was evaluated experimentally."

However, they lack inherent haptic feedback to match this expressiveness. One recent approach to this problem has been to actuate glass plates at high frequency to controllably vary surface friction. This paper extends this work by describing vibration beating, a novel haptic actuation method that increases the range of cues that can be rendered via dynamic variations of surface friction. In order to understand how users perceive the cues it produces a set of 16 stimuli were chosen and two studies that generate and interpret a perceptual map are described. Three distinct clusters of tactile cues are identified, delimited and named. These groupings will form the basis of future work to develop interfaces and interaction techniques based on the vibration beating actuation method."

This system aims to display and playback recorded conversations as if the remote people were talking in front of the viewer. It consists of multiple projectors and transparent screens attached to actuators. The screens displaying the life-size faces are spatially arranged to recreate the actual scene. Screen pose is dynamically synchronized to the actual head motions of the participants to emulate their head motions, which typically indicate shifts in visual attention. Our hypothesis is that physical screen motion with image motion can boost the viewer's understanding of others' visual attention. Experiments suggest that viewers can more clearly discern the attention of meeting participants, and more accurately identify the addressees."

The ability to find related information on other Web sites about selected subsets of the data, however, is currently compromised by the Web's inherent, one document at a time, navigation. In this paper we present work-in-progress on mashpoint, a framework that allows distributed data-powered Web applications to exchange subsets of their data, in effect enabling many-to-many navigation on the Web, at a more granular, data level. We hypothesise that allowing such navigation unlocks novel possibilities for information exploration and interaction on the Web.

Experimental results show with precisely timed alerts (in some cases) it is possible to react more quickly than the worst case which occurs during blink suppression."

  "Abstract": "Human-machine interaction could be enhanced by providing information about the user's state, allowing for automated adaption of the system. Such context-aware system, however, should be able to deal with spontaneous and subtle user behavior. The artificial intelligence behind such systems, hence, also needs to deal with spontaneous behavior data for training as well as evaluation. Although harder to collect and annotate, spontaneous behavior data are preferable to posed as they are representative of real world behavior. Towards this end, we have designed a distributed testbed for multisensory signals acquisition while facilitating spontaneous interactions. We recorded audio-visual as well as physiological signals from 6 pairs of subjects while they were playing a bluffing dice game against each other. In this paper, we introduce the collected database and provide our preliminary results of bluff detection based on spatio-temporal face image signal analysis."

While the younger model&#8217;s mean prediction matches younger human data well (within 3.2%), the older model overestimates older users&#8217; mean task times by 34.6%.

  "Abstract": "Disaster evacuation studies are important but difficult or impossible to conduct in the real world. Evacuation simulation in a virtual world can be an important tool to obtain data on the escape and choice behavior of people. However, to obtain accurate \"realistic\" data, the engagement of participants is a key challenge. Therefore, we describe the making of an engaging evacuation scenario called \"Everscape\", and highlight the collaborative effort of researchers from the informatics and transportation fields. Further, we describe encouraging results from a pilot study, which investigates the level of engagement of participants of the Everscape experience."

  "Abstract": "We propose a new mind map interface method for controlling virtual character&#8217;s artificial intelligence and behavior in games. Commonly used techniques, such as scripting, require an extensive analysis and discrimination of all the possible behaviors that are triggered by the stimuli received by the virtual character. Scripting is also subject to strict syntax rules that may be hard to comprehend by non-expert users. Instead, our method can be easily created by users that do not have any technical background, since they graphically represent the natural process of organizing information in the human brain. Our mind map interface method follows a behavior-based architecture combined with an emotional depth module to control the character&#8217;s behaviors individually in a game. We implemented a graph-based visual editor to ease the definition of the mind map nodes interactively. We also show how mind maps were implemented in the LIFEisGAME (LearnIng of Facial Expressions usIng Serious GAMEs) project as a proof of concept."

Our initial data gathering includes an interview with an expert in aging and physical therapy, and a focus group with older adults on the topics of exercise and technology. Based on these data, an early prototype game has been implemented for the Microsoft Kinect that aims to help encourage older adults to exercise. The Kinect application has been tested for basic usability and found to be promising. Next steps include play-tests with older adults, iterative development of the game to add motivational features, and evaluation of the game&#8217;s success in encouraging older adults to maintain an exercise regimen."

  "Authors": ["Ben Kirman", "Conor Linehan", "Shaun Lawson"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Lincoln"],
  "Abstract": "This paper describes ongoing work in developing social computing systems and services to support serendipitous real life experiences. The paper introduces the location-aware prototype service \"GetLostBot\", which uses the Foursquare API to longitudinally monitor a user&#8217;s check-in locations and intervenes when they have fallen into a predictable routine. Interventions take the form of mysterious walking directions on a map to unknown destinations that challenge the user to take an explorative attitude and go into the unknown. Early results from a user trial suggest that while users are extremely positive about the ideas and concept of delivering serendipity through social computing, in this case there was low engagement with the actual suggested new experiences and activity. Despite this, the act of the intervention itself is reported to still have intrinsic value. This finding is discussed in terms of potential design issues around supporting serendipity in future systems."

Our formative study indicates that CT skills are employed when children are asked to define strategies of common games such as Connect Four. In CTArcade, users can train their own virtual characters while playing games with it. Trained characters then play matches against other virtual characters. Based on reviewing the matches played, users can improve their game character. A basic usability evaluation was performed on the system, which helped to define plans for improving CTArcade and assessing its design goals."

One step towards tying quantitative physiological measures of player arousal to player experience reports are Biometric Storyboards (BioSt). They can visualise meaningful relationships between a player&#8217;s physiological changes and game events. This paper evaluates the usefulness of BioSt to the game industry. We presented the Biometric Storyboards technique to six game developers and interviewed them about the advantages and disadvantages of this technique."

In this study, we verify that the preference towards female nude photos was increased by modulating the frequency of the false heartbeat. We also discuss the suitable implementation of our method in applications such as movie viewing and daily communication."

  "Abstract": "In this paper we present a game design and evaluation model centered on the concept of participation, the way players take part in gameplay activity, from which gameplay experience emerges. The variety and subjectiveness of experiences enabled by the videogame medium lead us to consider the challenge of how to frame the notion of participation in a model of gameplay experience, that could serve as a guide for designers. The proposed model aims to contribute to an informed game design process by focusing on six perspectives of player participation. Playfulness, Challenge, Embodiment, Sociability, Sensemaking and Sensoriality. These perspectives are then exercised along three operational levels. Intention, Artifact and Participation - the setting of gameplay experience goals, the characterization of the videogame object, and the evaluation of the player experience."

However, it is still difficult for ordinary people to model the real-life objects and design their paper-folding patterns. In this paper we present ``Snap-n-Fold'', an origami-generating system based on real-life objects' structures captured by a camera. It is based on the algorithm which combines object extraction, structure skeletonization, and origami generation. Users only need to capture the desired object through the camera to create origami folding pattern. Snap-n-Fold can be implemented on both PC and mobile platforms such as iOS and Andriod, therefore users can model the real-life objects using origami by only taking a snap-shot of the objects anytime and anywhere."

Then, custom stress recognition software analyses the streams of data in real-time and associates stress levels to each event. Both contextual data and stress levels are aggregated in a searchable journal where the user can reflect on his/her physiological responses."

Physiotherapy, including prescribed exercises performed independently by patients in their homes, is a key treatment for many sufferers. However, many fail to complete home exercises, prolonging recovery periods or accelerating decline. Pervasive health technologies, capable of monitoring users in their homes, are ideally suited to address this problem. This paper describes user research with a group of three physiotherapists and eleven current physiotherapy patients to understand the problems and user needs underlying non-compliance with home exercise regimes. The user research adopted a speed dating approach and culminated with recommendations relating to the design of feedback, scheduling systems and privacy."

Our findings indicate that not only the characteristics of the users themselves are associated with sustained engagement with a weight loss site, but also that usage of particular features on the site results in higher return rates. These findings support a push for designers to understand their users and features of their site, in order to maximise engagement with their target audiences."

To design a platform that is both innovative and useful to patients, we conducted a series of design research studies with patients including focus groups, interviews and surveys. Results suggest a demand for this type of platform, openness towards sharing medical information anonymously, and the inherent complexity of information searches in this environment.

  "Authors": ["Shivashankar Halan", "Brent Rossen", "Michael Crary", "Benjamin Lok"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Florida"],
  "Abstract": "We propose a methodology to help people improve the accuracy of their mental model of a conversational partner by creating a virtual human representation of the partner. By creating a virtual human, the users will be able to transfer their mental model of the partner to a virtual human representation. Other people can then interact with the virtual human and provide feedback. The feedback will help the creator reduce the gap between their mental model of a partner and the actual qualities of the partner. Reducing this gap in perception is important in learning interpersonal skills. We implemented this methodology in a health professions course using Virtual People Factory, an online application for creating and interacting with virtual humans. The applicability of the methodology to reduce gaps in perception models was investigated through a user study with health professions students (n=32). The results indicate that students can reduce gaps in perceptions of conversational partners by creating virtual humans."

The control of the amount of physical activity is done through a newly defined system variable we call the Interaction Tempo. Moreover, the detection of this physical activity is done in a non-invasive manner using a computer vision system. Both the control potential of physical activity by the Interaction Tempo and the quantification of this physical activity by the computer vision system have been validated against the change in heart rate of the users. This provides a safe, unencumbered, comfortable and natural system for children play and opens the door to apply it in other exertion interfaces."

Previous work in multimodal home care systems has looked at how reminders might be disruptive [1] or socially appropriate [5]. However, previous work has not looked specifically at how reminder content is paired with a multimodal presentation, especially when that presentation is not speech or text based, for example an abstract visual or olfactory presentation. In order to explore these issues, we completed a survey that focused on how the content of a reminder might affect a variety of factors such as appropriateness, importance and annoyance. Building on this survey, we are currently completing a series of focus groups that looks at how users pair reminders with multimodal presentations."

  "Abstract": "User input on television typically requires a mediator device such as a handheld remote control. While being a well-established interaction paradigm, a handheld device has serious drawbacks. it can be easily misplaced due to its mobility and in case of a touch screen interface, it also requires additional visual attention. Emerging interaction paradigms like 3D mid-air gestures using novel depth sensors such as Microsoft's Kinect aim at overcoming these limitations, but are known for instance to be tiring. In this paper, we propose to leverage the palm as an interactive surface for TV remote control. Our contribution is two-fold. (1) we have explored the conceptual design space in an exploratory study. (2) Based upon these results, we investigated the accuracy and effectiveness of such an interface in a controlled experiment. Our results show that the palm has the potential to be leveraged for device-less and eyes-free TV interactions &#8211;without any third-party mediator device."

  "Abstract": "MAGIC (Manual and Gaze Input Cascaded) pointing methods use eye gaze as a complementary input for the primary input device. This paper introduces a novel MAGIC pointing technique to provide fast and accurate selection. Cursor sensitivity is reduced near eye focus to allow fine selection, and increased away from target to improve selection speed. MAGIC-SENSE is tested against a traditional mouse and a gaze only pointing method using an ISO 9241-9 compliant circular Fitts&#8217; Law experiment. Using MAGIC-SENSE, subjects achieved lower error rates without compromising movement times compared to mouse-only method. A local calibration method that can boost all MAGIC pointing techniques is discussed."

  "Affiliations": ["VU Amsterdam", "VU Public Result"],
  "Abstract": "Researchers studying virtual coaching have identified a variety of characteristics associated with heightened motivation, but have not, to date, identified a mechanism underlying the success of particular coaches. This project tests two possible explanations for how coaches heighten motivation. the first is the straightforward explanation that coaching heightens self-efficacy, which in turn raises motivation; the second is the more novel idea that the quality of the pseudo-relationship between the virtual coach and the trainee is key to motivation. In an experiment comparing three systematically differing coaches, virtual coaches heightened both self-efficacy and parasocial interaction in some coaching conditions, but only parasocial interaction explained the patterns of results for intrinsic motivation. The findings have important theoretical implications for understanding the effects of parasocial interaction on health behaviors, with practical applications for the design of virtual coaches to improve health."

Everyday objects sojourning in a beam are turned into dedicated projection surfaces and tangible interaction devices. While this has been explored for large projectors, the affordances of pico projectors are fundamentally different. they have a very small and strictly limited projection ray and can be carried around in a nomadic way during the day. Thus it is unclear how this could be actually leveraged for tangible interaction with physical, real world objects. We have investigated this in an exploratory field study and contribute the results. Based upon these, we present exemplary interaction techniques and early user feedback."

The results show that users physically navigate to shift fluently among different parts of the display and between parallel and joint group work."

Collaborative consumption, a new evolutionary step in SNS, enables the sharing of personal services, thus holding the potential to strengthen social integration and enable an independent lifestyle for the elderly. We therefore developed a local, service-oriented collaborative consumption platform called \"Bring Dich ein!\" with the purpose of facilitating social interaction across generations as well as the trade of peer-to-peer services. The platform was fully implemented in a participatory development process and evaluated in an extended pilot phase. The qualitative evaluation shows good usability for the elderly and high potential for the proposed concept within the target group."

We also report on different group techniques and usage patterns observed while using a pico projector. A future part of this on going study will compare mobile tablets with the same existing mobile solution in a museum environment."

VizWiz, a system for answering visual questions for blind users, has shown that crowdsourcing can be used for assistive technology in such domains. Our work extends the VizWiz model by enabling users to interact with the crowd via a real-time feedback loop. We introduce Legion.View, a system that enables such a real-time feedback loop for visual questions between users and crowd workers. Legion.View sends audio questions and streaming video to the crowd, and forwards feedback about the position and orientation of the camera and answers to questions back to users."

  "Affiliations": ["University of Rochester"],
  "Abstract": "Much of the current work in crowdsourcing is focused on increasing the quality of responses. Quality issues are most often due to a small subset of low quality workers. The ability to distinguish between high and low quality workers would allow a wide range of error correction to be performed for such tasks. However, differentiating between these types is difficult when no measure of individual success is available. We propose it is possible to use higher quality workers to compensate for lower quality ones, without explicitly identifying them, by allowing them to observe and react to the input of the collective. In this paper, we present initial work on eliciting this behavior and discuss how it may be possible to leverage self-correction in the crowd for better performance on continuous real-time tasks."

Basically, a video player displays only the current image and a timeline to interact with the entire video content. Rewinding and forwarding to a specific scene are thus little practicable for selecting the best video moments. Our proposal is the addition of an informative transparency overlay showing the salient information about a soccer game and allowing new multi-touch interactions. This audio emotional curve tends to describe crowd reactions and speaker excitements revealing the best soccer events. Our experiment shows that multi-touch selections based on this curve improve efficiency and fun."

This kind of search can be referred to as opportunistic search. The area of opportunistic search in meetings has not yet been studied. Our research is based upon this motivation. We propose an augmented tangible tabletop system with a semi-ambient conversation-context-aware surface as well as foldable paper browsers for supporting opportunistic search in collocated meetings.

The method is novel in that the user does not receive the results of the recognition process, except at the end of a phrase. The method is justified over soft keyboards in terms of a Frame Model of Visual Attention, which reveals both the presence and advantage of reduced visual attention. With less on-going feedback to monitor, there is a tendency for the user to enter gestures more quickly. Preliminary testing reveals reasonably quick text entry speeds (>20 wpm) with low errors rates (<5%)."

However, the full range of applications where TUIs can be utilized in practice is unclear. To resolve this problem, the benefits of TUIs must be analyzed and matched to an application domain where they hold advantages over more traditional systems. Since TUIs require users to use their hands in order to interact with the system, there is the possibility for these systems to leverage motor learning to help users perform specific tasks. In this paper we will describe an early attempt to understand how motor learning can be used to create a tangible password system. A novel tangible password system was created and a small study conducted in order to identify future research objectives."

Telecare is expected to play an important role in addressing some of the challenges of an ageing population.

This paper describes a participatory design project involving 25 designers, 6 service users, 11 potential future service users and 2 telecare suppliers. six concept designs were created for a wearable alarm button in two half-day workshops. Our main contribution is to present the design features considered most important to users, which can be incorporated into future product designs and inform other wearable alarm systems for older people. As a result of the project, a leading supplier has invited users to participate in their research and development activities for the first time."

For non-native English readers, it is challenging to understand first-hand information written in English under time constraints. Traditional readability enhancement research has focused on enhancing reading comprehension and user satisfaction, but average reading times for non-native readers have remained the same or even worse. In this paper, we investigate useful techniques for readers when reading web pages under time constraints, i.e., having skim reading capability. We propose two techniques to help non-native readers to skim read web pages. (1) content spotlight, masking and filtering; and (2) semantic data extraction and in-place translation. Froggy GX is a prototype system that implements proposed techniques to provide skim-reading support for non-native readers."

We propose a data-driven model for quality control in the context of crowdsourcing systems with the goal of assessing the quality of each individual contribution for parallel distributed tasks (allowing multiple people working on a same task). The model is initiated with a data training process providing a rough estimate for several quality-related performance measures (e.g. time spent on a task). The initial estimates are combined with observations of results produced by workers to estimate the quality for each individual contribution. We conduct a study to evaluate the model in the context of improving speech recognition-based text correction using MTurk services. Results indicate that the model accurately predicts quality for more than 92% of the non-negative (useful) contributions and 96% of the negative (useless) ones."

We de-scribe our case study in user-centered design of a do-main-specific language (DSL) for computer music. Since the potential usability problems of a DSL is large-ly unforeseeable in the early phase of the design, we took an approach that begins with the analysis of the usability problems in an existing DSL and then use the analysis for redesign of the DSL and design of a new DSL. The frameworks provided by the previous HCI studies are introduced into the design process. Such an approach is also valuable for claim-evidence corre-spondences for usability claims, which have been lack-ing in language design today."

Inspired by logical theories of intention as well as experimental results on human productivity, and leveraging the power of optimization algorithms, we seek to reinvent the digital calendar. First, we increase the expressive power of calendar systems by deriving new entity types that go beyond simple events to better represent human intentions, plans, and goals. Next, we build on social psychological research to characterize the properties of a schedule best engineered for human productivity. Finally, we develop an optimization framework and algorithm to generate these schedules from a set of entities. With these tools combined, we transform the digital calendar from a passive repository into an active scheduling assistant."

We take a more granular approach to explaining what people are doing in online communities and how motivations and habits explain their use of specific features. In the context of the peer-production community Everything2 we employ both server log data and self-report, finding that habit is a non-conscious-driven behavior that is more associated with less cognitively-demanding tasks than content production."

We address a challenge to many existing studies of motivation in online contexts. they are based on survey self-reports, which are susceptible to effects such as social desirability bias. In addition we investigate a second challenge to the extant research on motivation in the context of MTurk. a failure to examine potential differences between MTurk workers (Turkers) from different parts of the world, especially those from the US and India, MTurk's two largest worker groups. Using a survey technique called the list experiment, we observe distinct profiles of motivation and patterns of social desirability effects among Turkers in the US and India. Among US Turkers, we find that social desirability encourages over-reporting of each of four motivating factors we examined. The over-reporting was particularly large in the case of money as a motivator. In contrast, among Turkers in India we find a more complex pattern of social desirability effects, with workers under-reporting ``killing time'' and ``fun'' as motivations, and drastically over-reporting ``sense of purpose.'' We conclude by discussing these results and proposing implications for future research and design."

Incorporating about 10 years of server data from the online peer-production community Everything2, we looked at how specific features of voting predicted deletion of posts. We found that not all types of voting are the same. negative voting of users was the strongest factor explaining deletion of a Write-up. Receiving a positive vote from a member with higher status decreases the chances of deletion, while receiving a positive vote from a user with neutral status has a very little effect on the deletion of content."

  "Key": "sp106",
  "Authors": ["Stuart Card"],
  "Affiliations": ["Stanford University"],
  "Abstract": "Human-Computer Interaction now is almost a different discipline than at the time of the first CHI conference. The field has moved from command-line interfaces for time-sharing to gesture interfaces for brain wave sleep monitors on your telephone. As Hal Varian has pointed out, we are in one of those unusual combinatorial periods in history where technology offers us a rich set of recombinable components that have been perfected but not yet incorporated into the fabric of society. Furthermore, significant innovations can now be done by smaller teams at more rapid rates and lower cost than before. In fact, the technology has allowed the rise of a digital culture of DIY hobbyists, exemplified by the Maker, Instructables, and Quantified Self Movements, who emphasize exploring the newly possible and just-in-time self-education, There are at least two interesting implications for HCI, I think. First is that we are in a new golden age for HCI, like the heady days when the GUI was being invented. New I/O devices are needed, new major interaction paradigms are possible, and CHI conferences should become more interesting. Second, the state of current technology and the spirit of the Maker Movement suggest a means for making progress on one of HCI&#8217;s oldest structural problems. how to ground the field, accelerate its progress, and make it cumulative by fashioning theories and incorporating them into practice. It is this latter point on which I wish to dwell. In this talk, I will attempt to sketch out, in the spirit of the times, what an interaction science for HCI could look like, how it might be incorporated into practice, and how it might be taught.

  "Abstract": "Users are increasingly nomadic, carrying computing power with them. To gain rich input and output, users could annex displays and input devices when available, but annexing via VGA cable is insufficient. This article introduces XICE, which uses wireless networks to connect portable devices to display servers. Network connections eliminate cables, allow multiple people to share a display, and ease input annexation. XICE mitigates potentially malicious input, and facilitates comfortable viewing on a variety of displays via view-independent coordinates. The XICE-distributed graphics model greatly reduces portable device CPU usage and extends portable device battery life."

In most approaches, however, users have to cope with heterogeneous interfaces and information organization, as well as a lack of support for collaboration with mobile and remote users outside the smart space. In this paper, we present ReticularSpaces; a multi-display smart space system built on the principles of activity-based computing. The focus of ReticularSpaces is to support. (i) unified interaction with applications and documents through ReticularUI, a novel distributed user interfaces design; (ii) management of the complexity of tasks between users and displays; (iii) mobile users in a local, remote or `nomadic' settings; and (iv) collaboration among local and remote users. We describe the motivation, design, and architecture of ReticularSpaces, and report from a preliminary feasibility study. The study shows that participants found ReticularSpaces useful and effective, but at the same time reveals new areas for research on smart environments."

  "Abstract": "When multiple users are simultaneously sharing a workspace, it is not always clear what should happen when a user invokes an undo action. In this paper we explore different user interfaces for undo/redo for co-located collaborative workspaces, such as large interactive whiteboards. A preliminary study revealed that users expect neither a global nor personal undo, but rather a regional undo. We propose and evaluate three automatic regional undo/redo techniques (clustering, workspace, field of view) designed for a large interactive whiteboard. The results of the evaluation showed that an undo technique based on users&#65533; field of view was most preferred, while the content-based clustering technique produced most errors. We conclude with potential improvements to the developed techniques, and propose a set of design recommendations for implementing regional undo/redo on large interactive surfaces."

  "Authors": ["Hao L&#252;", "Yang Li"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Washington", "Google Research"],
  "Abstract": "Multi-touch gestures have become popular on a wide range of touchscreen devices, but the programming of these gestures remains an art. It is time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to handle the complicated touch state transitions that result from multiple fingers and their simultaneous movements. In this paper, we present Gesture Coder, which by learning from a few examples given by the developer automatically generates code that recognizes multi-touch gestures, tracks their state changes and invokes corresponding application actions. Developers can easily test the generated code in Gesture Coder, refine it by adding more examples, and once they are satisfied with its performance integrate the code into their applications. We evaluated our learning algorithm exhaustively with various conditions over a large set of noisy data. Our results show that it is sufficient for rapid prototyping and can be improved with higher quality and more training data. We also evaluated Gesture Coder's usability through a within-subject study in which we asked participants to implement a set of multi-touch interactions with and without Gesture Coder. The results show overwhelmingly that Gesture Coder significantly lowers the threshold of programming multi-touch gestures."

  "Key": "paper423",
  "Authors": ["Kenrick Kin", "Bj&#246;rn Hartmann", "Tony DeRose", "Maneesh Agrawala"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Pixar Animation Studios"],
  "Abstract": "Current multitouch frameworks require application developers to write recognition code for custom gestures; this code is split across multiple event-handling callbacks. As the number of custom gestures grows it becomes increasingly difficult to 1) know if new gestures will conflict with existing gestures, and 2) know how to extend existing code to reliably recognize the complete gesture set. Proton is a novel framework that addresses both of these problems. Using Proton, the application developer declaratively specifies each gesture as a regular expression over a stream of touch events. Proton statically analyzes the set of gestures to report conflicts, and it automatically creates gesture recognizers for the entire set. To simplify the creation of complex multitouch gestures, Proton introduces gesture tablature, a graphical notation that concisely describes the sequencing of multiple interleaved touch actions over time. Proton contributes a graphical editor for authoring tablatures and automatically compiles tablatures into regular expressions. We present the architecture and implementation of Proton, along with three proof-of-concept applications. These applications demonstrate the expressiveness of the framework and show how Proton simplifies gesture definition and conflict resolution."

  "Type": "Paper",
  "Key": "paper1130",
  "Authors": ["Tom Ouyang", "Yang Li"],
  "Affiliations": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Google Research"],
  "Abstract": "Personal user-defined gesture shortcuts have shown great potential for accessing the ever-growing amount of data and computing power on touchscreen mobile devices. However, their lack of scalability is a major challenge for their wide adoption. In this paper, we present Gesture Marks, a novel approach to touch-gesture interaction that allows a user to access applications and websites using gestures without having to define them first. It offers two distinctive solutions to address the problem of scalability. First, it leverages the 'wisdom of the crowd', a continually evolving library of gesture shortcuts that are collected from the user population, to infer the meaning of gestures that a user never defined himself. Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut. These approaches effectively bootstrap a user's personal gesture library, alleviating the need to define most gestures manually. Our work was motivated and validated via a series of user studies, and the findings from these studies add to the body of knowledge on gesture-based interaction."

  "Affiliations": ["Telecom Paristech"],
  "Abstract": "We report a comparative ethnographic study of a proximity-based mobile 'video game' (Dragon Quest 9) in Japan. the Nintendo DS game terminals may 'recognize' one another and allow players to exchange game resources when they are close to one another. Because different communication infrastructures are available, situations of encounter are shown to be potentially seamful and to support multi-layered participation frames. Our observations show a variety of encounter formats, among whom 'timid' encounters are the most characteristic of the kind of sociality which may develop in urban public places turned into proximity-sensitive 'hybrid ecologies' The normative order which governs such encounters is marked by a tension between the minimality expected of encounters with strangers in urban spaces, and the concern for identification and focused interaction that derives from being engaged in proximal digital communication. These empirical observations and framework of analysis offer insights for the design and the understanding of proximity-based mobile technologies."

We apply a naturalistic and longitudinal logs-based approach to collect real usage data from 24 iPhone users in the wild. These data are used to describe smartphone usage and analyze revisitation patterns of web browsers, native applications, and physical locations where phones are used. Among our findings are that web page revisitation through browsers occurred very infrequently (approximately 25% of URLs are revisited by each user), bookmarks were used sparingly, physical traversing patterns mirrored virtual (internet) traversing patterns and users systematically differed in their web use. We characterize these differences and suggest ways to support users with enhanced design of smartphone technologies and content."

  "Abstract": "Over the last few years, mobile applications demonstrating Augmented Reality (AR) &#8211; such as Layar, Junaio and Google Goggles &#8211; have been introduced to consumers. We conducted an online survey to explore the user experience (UX) of early stage mobile AR applications available in the market in spring 2011, covering both location-based AR browsers and image recognition AR applications for object-based interaction. We identify various types of experiences such applications have evoked by qualitatively analyzing 84 users&#8217; narratives of their most satisfying and unsatisfying experiences. The results highlight, for example, experiences of awareness of surroundings, empowerment, positive surprise, amazement and fascination from the novelty value, as well as some examples of immersion and social connectivity. The analysis indicates that the applications have not yet reached their potential in evoking a multifaceted user experience that is characteristic especially to AR. This work helps in understanding the experiential design potential in mobile AR and points out UX issues to further focus on in design."

  "Abstract": "Previous research on conversational, competitive, and cooperative systems suggests that people respond differently to humans and AI agents in terms of perception and evaluation of observed team-mate behavior. However, there has not been research examining the relationship between participants' protective behavior toward human/AI team-mates and their beliefs about their behavior. A study was conducted in which 32 participants played two sessions of a cooperative game, once with a 'presumed' human and once with an AI team-mate; players could 'draw fire' from a common enemy by 'yelling' at it. Overwhelmingly, players claimed they 'drew fire' on behalf of the presumed human more than for the AI team-mate; logged data indicates the opposite. The main contribution of this paper is to provide evidence of the mismatch in player beliefs about their actions and actual behavior with humans or agents and provides possible explanations for the differences."

Modeling the process of human adaptation to agents is important for designing intelligent interface agents and adaptive user interfaces that learn a user's preferences and behavior strategy. However, few studies on human adaptation to such an agent have been done. We propose a human adaptation model for a two-player game. We prepared an on-line experimental system in which a participant and an agent play a repeated penny-matching game with a bonus round. We then conducted experiments in which different opponent agents (human or robot) change their strategy during the game. The experimental results indicated that, as expected, there is an adaptation phase when a human is confronted with a change in the opponent agent's strategy, and adaptation is faster when a human is competing with robot than with another human."

  "Authors": ["Eric Gilbert"],
  "Affiliations": ["Georgia Institute of Technology"],
  "Abstract": "Social translucence is a landmark theory in social computing. Modeled on physical life, it guides designers toward elegant social technologies. However, we argue that it breaks down over modern social network sites because social networks resist its physical metaphors. In this paper, we build theory relating social translucence to social network structure. To explore this idea, we built a tool called Link Different. Link Different addresses a structural awareness problem by letting users know how many of their Twitter followers already a saw link via someone else they follow. During two months on the web, nearly 150K people used the site a total of 1.3M times. Its widespread, viral use suggests that people want social translucence, but network structure gets in the way. We conclude the paper by illustrating new design problems that lie at the intersection of social translucence and other unexplored network structures."

In this paper we provide an in-depth analysis of how the news broke and spread on Twitter. We confirm the claim that Twitter broke the news first, and find evidence that Twitter had convinced a large number of its audience before mainstream media confirmed the news. We also discover that attention on Twitter was highly concentrated on a small number of 'opinion leaders' and identify three groups of opinion leaders who played key roles in spreading the news. individuals affiliated with media played a large part in breaking the news, mass media brought the news to a wider audience and provided eager Twitter users with content on external sites, and celebrities helped to spread the news and stimulate conversation. Our findings suggest Twitter has great potential as a news medium."

As a forum for sharing news and discussing events, it can provide instant access to the latest updates, but this is not always welcome. In the case of television shows or live sporting events, for example, tweets about them may reveal spoilers to users in different time zones or who are delaying their viewing until later. More broadly, because Twitter is a broadcast medium, users may often want to temporarily or permanently hide content about a very specific given topic. In this paper, we describe the unique challenges to HCI, social computing, and computational linguistics posed by the task of building an interface that blocks all tweets about a specific event or topic. We illustrate some of the challenges through a pilot experiment run for three major television events. the 2009 NFC Championship football game, the 2010 mid-season finale of the show Glee, and the 2010 season premiere of the show 24. While simple techniques achieve very high recall (>98%), spoilers still make it through the filter and precision is extremely poor. We conclude with a description of challenges to the community in implementing this new and increasingly important feature."

  "Abstract": "Nokia Internet Pulse is a system for visualizing current discussion around a particular topic on Twitter. It consists of a time-series of stacked tag clouds consisting of the (interesting) words in tweets that match a topic. Words are sized proportional to frequency and colored according to the emotional content of the tweet. if several people tweet 'I love my Nokia N900', then 'N900' will show up colored bright green, because it's in the same tweet as the word 'love', which the system recognizes as positive. In addition to showing topics of corporate interest ('Nokia', 'N9', etc.), the system is also useful for understanding buzz around individuals ('Rihanna'), conferences ('#chi2012'), topics ('rumor OR rumors'), Twitter-specific phenomena ('RT') and more. Clicking on words shows a list of tweets that contain those words, allowing easy drill-down to view individual tweets. It is available at http.//nip.nokia.com/"

  "Abstract": "Participation is of high relevance to the CHI Design community. Participatory work has been performed with very different intentions. to democratize the design process; to better inform the design of new systems; to engage the public in the construction of their own futures; or simply to appease funding commitments. Whilst this increased attention has lead to a large amount of methodological innovation, very little effort has been spent reflecting on why various participatory approaches should, or should not be, used and how we can assess their impacts on the design process and products. This invited SIG will bring together invited experts who have explored participation to different degrees within their past work to provoke group and plenary audience discussion. The aim of this SIG is to provide an opportunity for discussion and reflection on how and why participative methods are used in HCI research and practice."

Examples include attention-aware adaptations or the combination of gaze and hand gestures for interaction with distant displays. This SIG meeting provides a discussion venue for researchers and practitioners interested in gaze interaction in the post-WIMP era. We wish to draw attention to this emerging field and eventually formulate fundamental research questions. We will discuss the potential of gaze interaction for diverse application areas, interaction tasks, and multimodal user interface combinations. Our aims are to promote this research field, foster a larger research community, and establish the basis for a workshop at CHI 2013."

  "Abstract": "Multi-user interfaces are said to provide new opportunities for users to benefit from &#8216;natural&#8217; interaction in supporting collaboration, compared to individual and non-colocated technologies. We identify three mechanisms potentially accounting for the success of such interfaces. high levels of awareness of others, high levels of control over interface and high levels of transparency of background information. We challenge the idea that interaction over such interfaces is necessarily &#8216;natural&#8217; and argue that everyday interaction involves constraints on awareness, control and transparency. These constraints support smoother interaction. We present a framework characterizing the design of multi-user interfaces in terms of how constraints can be best used to promote collaboration, based on how these mechanisms support transparent and salient interactions. We use this framework first to explain successes and failures of existing designs, then apply it to three case studies, and finally derive criteria for use in designing multi-user interfaces for collaboration."

In a study of 188 very active online enterprise communities, we found systematic differences in size, demographics and participation, aligned with differences in community types. Different types of communities differed in their appropriation of social software tools to create and use shared resources, and build relationships. We propose implications for design of community support features, services for potential community members, and organizations looking to derive value from online groups."

  "Abstract": "This paper reports on the use of social network sites (MySpace and Facebook) by homeless young people, an extraordinary user population, made so in part by its vulnerability. Twenty-three participants of diverse ethnicities, 11 women and 12 men (mean age, 21.7 years), were interviewed in same-sex discussion groups of four participants each. The interviews consisted of questions about the uses, benefits, and harms of social network sites and how people present themselves online. Qualitative analysis of the discussion group transcripts shows how young people explore their identities, cultivate and exploit social ties, experience interpersonal tensions, manage incompatible audiences, and respond to shifting affiliations and transitions. From this analysis, implications for social intervention and technical design are presented, focused on maintaining ties with pro-social family and friends and with maintaining separation between communication spheres of incompatible audiences. This work contributes to the growing literature on vital, deeply human experiences that have become associated with social network sites."

  "Abstract": "There is an increasing spread of flexible software applica-tions that can be modified by adding components (some-times called plug-ins or add-ons). A popular example in the software development domain is Eclipse, a flexible devel-opment environment that can be extended with literally thousands of different plug-ins. However, searching, in-stalling and configuring new plug-ins requires complex overhead work that is only weakly addressed by existing support mechanisms. Recent research has highlighted the related practices of learning about new plug-ins and tailor-ing software tools as being highly cooperative, situated, socially embedded, and often connected to particular work situations. Based on an empirical study in small software enterprises, we develop an understanding of appropriation as a social and collaborative activity. We then suggest de-sign principles for appropriation support that are grounded in the practices we have found in the field, and present a prototypical implementation of the concept that extends existing mechanisms of sharing tools and tool-knowledge."

Through a study of 614 staff members at a large university, we show how social capital, network characteristics, and use of Facebook are related to how useful individuals find Facebook to be for informational purposes and their propensity to seek different types of information on the site. We find that bridging social capital and engagement with one&#8217;s network through directed communication behaviors are important predictors of these dimensions of information seeking; furthermore, a number of demographic and usage behavior differences exist between those who choose to engage in information-seeking behaviors on Facebook and those who do not. Finally, when predicting information-seeking behaviors, we identify a significant interaction between users&#8217; perceptions of Facebook as appropriate for purposes beyond the purely social and their engagement with their network."

  "Abstract": "Examples have been widely used in the area of web design to help web authors create web pages. However, without actually understanding how an example is constructed, people often have trouble extracting the elements they want and incorporating them into their own design. This paper introduces WebCrystal, a web development tool that helps users understand how a web page is built. WebCrystal con-tributes novel interaction techniques that let the user quickly access HTML and CSS information by selecting questions regarding how a selected element is designed. It pro-vides answers using a textual description and a customized code snippet that can be copied-and-pasted to recreate the desired properties. WebCrystal also supports combining the styles and structures from multiple elements into the generated code snippet, and provides visualizations on the web page itself to explain layout relationships. Our user study shows that WebCrystal helped both novice and experienced developers complete more tasks successfully using significantly less time."

  "Abstract": "Recently questioning and answering (Q&A) communities that facilitate knowledge sharing among people have been introduced to the mobile environments such as Naver Mobile Q&A and ChaCha. These mobile Q&A services are very different from traditional Q&A sites in that questions/answers are short in length and are exchanged via mobile devices (e.g., SMS or mobile Internet). While traditional Q&A sites have been well investigated, so far little is known about the mobile Q&A usage. To understand mobile Q&A usage, we analyzed 2.4 million question/answer pairs spanning a 14 month period from Naver Mobile Q&A and performed a complementary survey study of 555 active mobile Q&A users. We find that mobile Q&A is deeply wired into users' everyday life activities--its usage is largely dependent on users' spatial, temporal, and social contexts; the key factors of mobile Q&A usage are accessibility/convenience of mobile Q&A, promptness of receiving answers, and users' satisficing behavior of information seeking (i.e., minimizing efforts and settling with good enough information). We also observe that users tend to seek more factual information attributed to everyday life activities than they do on traditional Q&A sites and that they exhibit unique interaction patterns such as repeating and refining questions as coping strategies in seeking information needs. Our main findings reported in the paper have significant implications on the design of mobile Q&A systems."

  "Abstract": "A dominant way in which we organize our world is through social interactions. Much research has made use of social context as a way to support information storage and re-finding. However, they tend to focus only on the virtual side of sociality, and downplay the role of physicality in social interaction. In our research, we investigate how a person's physical-social interactions, in the form of co-presence, can be employed to support digital information management. We designed and implemented a system based on this concept and evaluated it in three two-month long case studies. Our system associates digital information used in social situations with co-present individuals through the use of automatic or manual tagging. Our findings showed that although the three participants varied greatly in their information filing and information use strategies, they all accessed digital information using people or groups of people, thereby supporting our initial premise. However, we found that the need to use digital information during social interactions arises only when there is a shared focus in the form of, for example, a large display, or when there is a social purpose for the information, for instance to share it with other meeting members at a later time. Our observations suggest the need for further research and innovation in technology affordances for real-time information use in physical-social interactions."

  "Abstract": "While interacting with mobile devices, users may press against touch screens and also exert tangential force to the display in a sliding manner. We seek to guide UI design based on the tangential force applied by a user to the surface of a hand-held device. A prototype of an interface using tangential force input was implemented utilizing a force sensitive layer and an elastic layer and used for the user experiment. We investigated user controllability to reach and maintain target force levels and considered the effects of hand pose and direction of force input. Our results imply no significant difference in performance when applying force holding the device in one hand and in two hands. We also observed that users have more physical and perceived loads when applying tangential force in the left-right direction compared to the up-down direction. Based on the experimental results, we discuss considerations for user interface applications of tangential-force-based interface."

  "Abstract": "In this paper, we report about a large-scale in-situ study of tactile feedback for pedestrian navigation systems. Recent advances in smartphone technology have enabled a number of interaction techniques for smartphone that use tactile feedback to deliver navigation information. The aim is to enable eyes-free usage and avoid distracting the user from the environment. Field studies where participants had to fulfill given navigation tasks, have found these techniques to be efficient and beneficial in terms of distraction. But it is not yet clear whether these findings will replicate in in-situ usage. We, therefore, developed a Google Maps-like navigation application that incorporates interaction techniques proposed in previous work. The application was published for free on the Android Market and so people were able to use it as a navigation system in their everyday life. The data collected through anonymous monitoring suggests that tactile feedback is successfully adopted in one third of all trips and has positive effects on the user's level of distraction."

  "Abstract": "Funneling and saltation are two major illusory feedback techniques for vibration-based tactile feedback. They are often put into practice e.g. to reduce the number of vibrators to be worn on the body and thereby build a less cumbersome feedback device. Recently, these techniques have been found to be applicable to eliciting 'out of the body' experiences as well (e.g. through user-held external objects). This paper examines the possibility of applying this phenomenon to interacting with virtual objects. Two usability experiments were run to test the effects of funneling and saltation respectively for perceiving tactile sensation from a virtual object in an augmented reality setting. Experimental results have shown solid evidences for phantom sensations from virtual objects with funneling, but mixed results for saltation."

  "Authors": ["Chris Harrison", "Scott Hudson"],
  "Affiliations": ["Disney Research, Pittsburgh", "Carnegie Mellon University"],
  "Abstract": "Touch input is constrained, typically only providing finger X/Y coordinates. To access and switch between different functions, valuable screen real estate must be allocated to buttons and menus, or users must perform special actions, such as touch-and-hold, double tap, or multi-finger chords. Even still, this only adds a few bits of additional information, leaving touch interaction unwieldy for many tasks. In this work, we suggest using a largely unutilized touch input dimension. shear (force tangential to a screen's surface). Similar to pressure, shear can be used in concert with conventional finger positional input. However, unlike pressure, shear provides a rich, analog 2D input space, which has many powerful uses. We put forward five classes of advanced interaction that considerably expands the envelope of interaction possible on touchscreens."

Many ungrounded force-feedback devices rely on the gyro effect to produce torques on the human body, but their active control systems render them extremely bulky for implementation in small mobile devices. We present GyroTab, a relatively flat handheld system that utilizes the gyro effect to provide torque feedback. GyroTab relies on the user to produce an input torque and provides feedback by opposing that torque, making its feedback reactive to the user&#65533;s motion. We describe the implementation of GyroTab, discuss the kinds of feedback it generates, and explore some of the psychophysical results we obtained from a study with the device."

  "Abstract": "We present a method for obtaining lab-quality measurements of pointing performance from unobtrusive observations of natural in situ interactions. Specifically, we have developed a set of user-independent classifiers for discriminating between deliberate, targeted mouse pointer movements and those movements that were affected by any extraneous factors. To develop and validate these classifiers, we developed logging software to unobtrusively record pointer trajectories as participants naturally interacted with their computers over the course of several weeks. Each participant also performed a set of pointing tasks in a formal study set-up. For each movement, we computed a set of measures capturing nuances of the trajectory and the speed, acceleration, and jerk profiles. Treating the observations from the formal study as positive examples of deliberate, targeted movements and the in situ observations as unlabeled data with an unknown mix of deliberate and distracted interactions, we used a recent advance in machine learning to develop the classifiers. Our results show that, on four distinct metrics, the data collected in-situ and filtered with our classifiers closely matches the results obtained from the formal experiment."

  "Abstract": "We present a general-purpose implementation of a target aware pointing technique, functional across an entire desktop and independent of application implementations. Specifically, we implement Grossman and Balakrishnan&#65533;s Bubble Cursor, the fastest general pointing facilitation technique in the literature. Our implementation obtains the necessary knowledge of interface targets using a combination of pixel-level analysis and social annotation. We discuss the most novel aspects of our implementation, including methods for interactive creation and correction of pixel-level prototypes of interface elements and methods for interactive annotation of how the cursor should select identified elements. We also report on limitations of the Bubble Cursor unearthed by examining our implementation in the complexity of real-world interfaces. We therefore contribute important progress toward real-world deployment of an important family of techniques and shed light on the gap between understanding techniques in controlled settings versus behavior with real-world interfaces."

  "Abstract": "Various systems for hand tool skill training have been developed in the domain of haptic displays. These systems typically present force to a learner&#65533;s palm by directly actuating the tool. However, this approach is sometimes ineffective because learners have difficulty sensing the haptic feedback from the tool when they are holding it tightly. Thus, we propose a different approach (OCHD) that effectively guides the learner&#65533;s hand by presenting force to the back of his/her hand as if an instructor is holding it. A preliminary experiment showed that OCHD effectively guides users with less actuator drive force than cases where the tool is directly actuated."

  "Abstract": "We describe the design and analysis of a Fitts' law experiment, conducted in a multiple-display environment (MDE), in which the physical gap between displays and the proximity of targets to the gap systematically varied. Participants achieved decreasing throughput values (a combined measure of movement time and accuracy in a target acquisition task) under increasing gap sizes. Participants likewise performed relatively poorly in tasks involving monitor crossing over all gap conditions, especially so when motion either originates or terminates very close to the gap. Both results could be considered surprising since in either case, the amount of mouse movement needed to successfully execute the task does not change based on physical gap size or a target's proximity to the edge. Fitts' law may underestimate the difficulty of movement tasks in MDEs."

However, this model and its existing extensions are still limited for 2D pointing task especially when the effects of movement direction (&#952;) remain in the task. In this paper, we employ the concept of projection to account for the effects of target width (W) and height (H) on movement time so that we seamlessly integrate the four factors, i.e. &#952;, amplitude (A), W and H, into the new extension of Fitts' law, which can uncover not only the periodicity of the asymmetrical impacts of W and H with the variation of &#952; but also their interrelation. Carrying out two experiments, we verify that the vertical projection of W and the horizontal projection of H in the line of movement direction can be viewed as the determinants of movement time. Finally, we offer recommendations for 2D pointing experiments and discuss the implications for interface designs."

To improve on that, we propose gaze-supported interaction as a more natural and effective way combining a user's gaze with touch input from a handheld device. In particular, we contribute a set of novel and practical gaze-supported selection techniques for distant displays. Designed according to the principle gaze suggests, touch confirms they include an enhanced gaze-directed cursor, local zoom lenses and more elaborated techniques utilizing manual fine positioning of the cursor via touch. In a comprehensive user study with 24 participants, we investigated the potential of these techniques for different target sizes and distances. All novel techniques outperformed a simple gaze-directed cursor and showed individual advantages. In particular those techniques using touch for fine cursor adjustments (MAGIC touch) and for cycling through a list of possible close-to-gaze targets (MAGIC tab) demonstrated a high overall performance and usability."

In this paper we show that creation of a scripted or recorded video of an expert's think-aloud session augmented by an animation of their scanpaths can result in an effective aid for learners of visual search. Because the creation of such a video is relatively easy, the benefits-to-cost ratio may potentially be substantial, especially in settings where learned visual scanning strategies are indicators of expertise. We suggest that two such examples are examinations of Chest X-Rays and histological slides. Results are presented where straightforward construction of an instruction video provides measurable benefit to novice as well as experienced learners in the latter context."

Standard metrics such as words per minute and keystrokes per character yield information only about the effectiveness of the technology and the interaction techniques developed for eye typing. We conducted an extensive study with almost five hours of eye typing per participant and report on extended qualitative and quantitative analysis of the relationship of dwell time, text entry rate, errors made, and workload experienced by the participants. The analysis method is comprehensive and stresses the need to consider different metrics in unison. The results highlight the importance of catering for individual differences and lead to suggestions for improvements in the interface."

Gaze-based graphical passwords are a particularly promising means for shoulder-surfing-resistant authentication, but selecting secure passwords remains challenging. In this paper, we present a novel gaze-based authentication scheme that makes use of cued-recall graphical passwords on a single image. In order to increase password security, our approach uses a computational model of visual attention to mask those areas of the image that are most likely to attract visual attention. We create a realistic threat model for attacks that may occur in public settings, such as filming the user's interaction while drawing money from an ATM. Based on a 12-participant user study, we show that our approach is significantly more secure than a standard image-based authentication and gaze-based 4-digit PIN entry."

  "Abstract": "Bandwidth caps, a limit on the amount of data users can upload and download in a month, are common globally for both home and mobile Internet access. With caps, each bit of data consumed comes at a cost against a monthly quota or a running tab. Yet, relatively little work has considered the implications of this usage-based pricing model on the user experience. In this paper, we present results from a qualitative study of households living with bandwidth caps. Our findings suggest home users grapple with three uncertainties regarding their bandwidth usage. invisible balances, mysterious processes, and multiple users. We discuss how these uncertainties impact their usage and describe the potential for better tools to help monitor and manage data caps. We conclude that as a community we need to cater for users under Internet cost constraints."

  "Authors": ["Jessie Chin", "Wai-Tat Fu"],

  "Abstract": "An empirical study was conducted to investigate how older and younger users learned by performing exploratory search of health information using an interface that recommended relevant links based on browsing histories. While older and younger users gained both factual and structural knowledge about the health topics, significant age differences were observed. Our results showed that processing of recommended and regular Web links imposed distinct demands on cognitive abilities, which at least partially explained the observed age differences in the search process. The use of recommended links was positively associated with general knowledge, while the use of regular Web links was positively associated with processing capacity. Results also showed that the recommended links benefited both younger and older adults by broadening the exploration of information, which led to better learning. Implications on designs of health information interfaces that facilitate exploratory search and learning for different age groups were discussed."

  "Abstract": "Minorities are the fastest growing demographic in the U.S. and the poverty level in the U.S. is the highest it has been in 50 years. We interviewed middle to upper class, suburban, white American parents and low-income, urban, African-American parents to understand how each group incorporates technology into their lives. Participants had teens in their homes and devices like computers and cell phones played a powerful and preeminent role in family life. Our results show that socioeconomic differences both reflect and reinforce technology use at home. Specifically, low socioeconomic status families share devices more often and low socioeconomic status teens have more responsibility and independence in their technology use. We argue that that as low socioeconomic status families become the majority demographic, the CHI community needs to better understand how to design for these groups."

  "Authors": ["Aur&#233;lien Tabard", "Juan David Hincapi&#233; Ramos", "Jakob Bardram"],
  "Affiliations": ["IT University of Copenhagen"],
  "Abstract": "In this paper we present a field trial of the eLabBench, a digital tabletop-based laboratory bench designed to support the exploratory practices of molecular biologists in the laboratory. The eLabBench supports the organization of personal information, capture of experimental work for later access, and the use of a variety of computational resources directly at the lab bench. We deployed the eLabBench in a biology laboratory for 16 weeks, and invited seven molecular biologists to run experiments on it. We report on how they used the bench and how it fitted within their larger experimental process. The main impact of the eLabBench lies in the changes it sparked off in preparing, running, and documenting lab experiments. By supporting computation at the bench and management of physical objects in the office, the eLabBench blurred the separation between office and laboratory work. Based on our observations, we discuss how interactive systems for laboratories such as the eLabBench can support a more exploratory or design-oriented way of 'doing' science."

  "Abstract": "Scientific inquiry can be more authentic and meaningful to students when using personal and peer-collected data. The challenges of organizing and evaluating a potentially large amount of data can be overcome through the use of annotations (title, tags, and audio notes). We created Zydeco, a multi-component system that students use to collect annotated multimedia data from a museum (using a smartphone app), and then create a scientific explanation with their personal and peers' data (using a tablet app). We ran a classroom study with 54 students (ages 11-13) investigating how students searched for, evaluated, and used annotated data to construct a scientific explanation. We found that tags supported data interpretation, while title searching and panning through the unfiltered data set supported finding and using data."

Interviews of instructors and students have revealed that novice biologists have difficulty understanding phylogenetics. Moreover, misinterpretations of phylogenetics are common among college-level students.

We conducted an experimental study with 56 participants, comparing students' conceptual learning and engagement using Phylo-Genie as. 1) a multi-touch tabletop interface and 2) a pen and paper activity. Our findings show that the tabletop implementation fosters collaborative learning by engaging users in the activity. We also shed light on the way in which our design principles facilitated engagement and collaborative learning in a tabletop environment."

Results indicate that our tool is useful for a variety of teacher and learner needs, including awareness of time spent and resource use. Tools like SAM can also be deployed in other settings that require awareness and self-reflection, e.g. in personal informatics and health monitoring, where motivated users will value the flexible mechanisms to analyze trending data."

  "Abstract": "Automated detection of excessive visual search (ES) experienced by a user during software use presents the potential for substantial improvement in the efficiency of supervised usability analysis. This paper presents an objective evaluation of several methods for the automated segmentation and classification of ES intervals from an eye movement recording, a technique that can be utilized to aid in the identification of usability problems during software usability testing. Techniques considered for automated segmentation of the eye movement recording into unique intervals include mouse/keyboard events and eye movement scanpaths. ES is identified by a number of eye movement metrics, including. fixation count, saccade amplitude, convex hull area, scanpath inflections, scanpath length, and scanpath duration. The ES intervals identified by each algorithm are compared to those produced by manual classification to verify the accuracy, precision, and performance of each algorithm. The results indicate that automated classification can be successfully employed to substantially reduce the amount of recorded data reviewed by HCI experts during usability testing, with relatively little loss in accuracy."

  "Type": "Paper",

  "Authors": ["Radu Jianu", "David Laidlaw"],
  "Affiliations": ["Brown University"],
  "Abstract": "Subtle changes in analysis system interfaces can be used purposely to alter users' analytic behaviors. In a controlled study subjects completed three analyses at one-week intervals using an analysis support system. Control subjects used one interface in all sessions. Test subjects used modified versions in the last two sessions. a first set of changes aimed at increasing subjects' use of the system and their consideration of alternative hypotheses; a second set of changes aimed at increasing the amount of evidence collected. Results show that in the second session test subjects used the interface $39%$ more and switched between hypotheses $19%$ more than in the first session. They then collected $26%$ more evidence in the third than in the second session. These increases differ significantly ($p<0.05$) from near constant control rates. We hypothesize that this approach can be used in many real applications to guide analysts unobtrusively towards improved analytic strategies."

  "Type": "Paper",

  "Authors": ["Vidhya Navalpakkam", "Elizabeth Churchill"],
  "Affiliations": ["Yahoo! Research"],
  "Abstract": "Previous studies have used mouse tracking as a tool to measure usability of webpages, user attention and search relevance. In this paper, we go beyond measurement of user behavior to prediction of the resulting user experience from mouse patterns alone. Specifically, we identify mouse markers that can predict user frustration and reading struggles at reasonably high accuracy. We believe that mouse-based prediction of user experience is an important advance, and could potentially offer a scalable way to infer user experience on the web. In addition, we demonstrate that mouse tracking could be used for applications such as evaluating content layout and content noticeability; we apply this in particular to advertisements. More generally, it could be used to infer user attention in complex webpages containing images, text and varied content, including how attention patterns vary with page layout and user distraction."

We address these problems by adding real-time feedback to the AR overlay. We conducted a controlled experiment comparing AR with and without feedback, and with standard textual and graphical instructions. Results show significant benefits for mobile AR with feedback and reveals some problems with the other techniques."

Results show. (a) significant differences in overall retrieval time between PC and Mac that arise from different organizational strategies rather than interface design; (b) the default Windows presentation is suboptimal &#65533; if changed, retrieval time could be reduced substantially and (c) contrary to our expectations, folder depth did not affect step duration.

However, little is known about the relationship between the structural properties of communication and performance in these teams. This study examined the effect of communication structure, specifically hierarchical and small-world structures on the delivery performance and quality outcomes of a large-scale new product development project. Our longitudinal analyses revealed that structuring communication patterns in a hierarchical manner significantly improves delivery performance. However, hierarchical communication has a detrimental effect on quality while small-world communication structures improved the quality outcomes of development teams. We discuss the implications of these results for collaborative tools that support communication tradeoffs"

MRP systems are physically embodied mobile videoconferencing systems that remote co-workers control. These systems allow remote users, pilots, to actively initiate conversations and to navigate throughout the local environment. To investigate ways of encouraging team-like behavior among local and remote co-workers, we conducted a 2 (visual framing. decoration vs. no decoration) x 2 (verbal framing. interdependent vs. independent performance scoring) between-participants study (n=40). We hypothesized that verbally framing the situation as interdependent and visually framing the MRP system to create a sense of self-extension would enhance group cohesion between the local and the pilot. We found that the interdependent framing was successful in producing more in-group oriented behaviors and, contrary to our predictions, visual framing of the MRP system weakened team cohesion."

The results showed that participants in the intergroup condition, with both location-based and shared identity faultlines, performed at a higher level than participants in the strangers condition, with only the location-based faultline. In the intergroup condition, the performance effects of location and shared identity were roughly equal and did not affect each other differentially in combination."

TTP uses lightweight video recordings to pre-record your contributions to a meeting, which are played on a tablet that serves as a proxy for you during the meeting. Reactions and responses in the meeting are also captured in video to give you feedback of what happened at the meeting. A working prototype of TTP was deployed and studied within four developer teams in their daily stand-up meetings. The study found that the affordances of video helped integrate the time traveler into the social context of the meeting, although the current prototype was better at enabling the time traveler to contribute to the meeting than it was in conveying the meeting experience back to the time traveler."

  "Affiliations": ["MIT Media Lab"],
  "Abstract": "A long-standing goal in rehabilitation science is to apply neuromechanical principles of human movement to the development of highly functional prostheses and orthoses. When well-designed and properly customized for an individual, these devices not only traverse physical limitations but also become very much a part of the wearer's physical self. Critical to this effort is the understanding of how humans interact with their own limbs, and the development of actuator technologies and control methodologies that interact with the human in manner compatible with their natural interaction. In this lecture, I present several examples of prosthethic limbs and orthotic devices designed to support comfortable and efficient use, highly precise control, and ease of use. These examples are then used to motivate design strategies for prosthetic and orthotic devices. Bio. Hugh Herr is Associate Professor within MIT's Program of Media Arts and Sciences, and The Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology. His primary research objective is to apply principles of biomechanics and neural control to guide the designs of wearable robotic systems for human rehabilitation and physical augmentation. In the area of human augmentation, Professor Herr has employed cross bridge models of skeletal muscle to the design and optimization of a new class of human-powered mechanisms that amplify endurance for cyclic anaerobic activities. He has also built elastic shoes that increase metabolic economy for running, and leg exoskeletons for walking load-carrying augmentation. In the area of assistive technology, Professor Herr&#8217;s group has developed powered orthotic and prosthetic mechanisms for use as assistive interventions in the treatment of leg disabilities caused by amputation, stroke, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. Professor Herr has authored or coauthored over 60 technical publications in biomechanics and wearable robotics. He was the recipient of the 2007 Heinz Award for Technology, Economy, and Employment."

Imagery&#8212;which subsumes digital imagery&#8212;goes well beyond sketching and beyond storyboards, screenshots and wireframes. We will address how a broader framework for visual thinking and imagery in HCI can play a role in raising the visual standards of HCI research and practice. Workshop participants will investigate possibilities for developing a culture of curatorial gaze in HCI, in order to (i) promote collection of digital images as a method appropriate for a design-oriented discipline, (ii) invite others to contribute to a genre of working and corpus of imagery unique to HCI, and (iii) to expand the approaches that design-oriented HCI may productively and creatively draw upon.",

However, current user interfaces (UIs) often lack adequate support for 3D interactions. 2D metaphors still dominate in GUI design, 2D desktop systems are often limited in cases where natural interaction with 3D content is required, and sophisticated 3D user interfaces consisting of stereoscopic projections and tracked input devices are rarely adopted by ordinary users. In the future, novel interaction design solutions are needed to better support the natural interaction and utilize the special features of 3D technologies. In this workshop we address the research and industrial challenges involved in exploring the space where the flat digital world of surface computing meets the physical, spatially complex, 3D space in which we live.

  "Abstract": "The increasing ubiquity of computing devices coupled with recent empirical research on the factors that affect the likelihood of conflict provide HCI researchers with new opportunities to conduct research on interactive systems designed to prevent, de-escalate and recover from conflict. Approaches used by HCI researchers in this field have included the use of a multi-lifespan research initiative to support peace and reconciliation after genocide, CSCW to facilitate communication, visualization to help detect landmines, and calming technology to support individuals desiring interactive systems that scaffold non-violent interactions. In this workshop we plan to further explore these ideas and discuss existing and future challenges.",

  "Abstract": "Increasingly products need to be cool, wow, fun, rather than merely being 'functional' in order to appeal to consumers. Product innovation then turns into not only working out how to apply technologies to realize some useful product function, but also in how to create an appealing and alluring experience. The core question one would like to see answered already early on in the development process is, of course, how we can make sure that the final product is going to be fun, pleasurable, appealing (in addition to being functional and usable). However, when looking at the literature, no real, concrete, hands-on answers are popping up yet. On the other hand, in industry and academia much tacit knowledge and experience must exist, about what worked before and what not. Analyzing systematically successful product introductions, tapping into that tacit knowledge, may help to derive heuristics that can support new product and service development, and aid in a better understanding of this elusive concept.",

  "Location": "Room 19AB",
  "Abstract": "This workshop will explore how defamiliarization - a process of slowing down perception - can be exploited as a bridge between usability and innovation. Victor Shklovsky, a Russian literary critic, coined the term &#8216;defamiliarization&#8217;, which he defined as the literary technique of slowing down a reader&#8217;s recognition of what the author is describing in order to increase the vividness of the reader&#8217;s perception. [Margolin 2005] In interface design, defamiliarization can be used to bring users&#8217; attention to the interface itself because of a temporary lack of fulfilment of expectations [Peterson, M.G., Iversen, O.S., Krogh, G.P 2004; Sengers, Gaver 2006]. This concept is particularly promising for the user interface in the context of &#8216;radical&#8217; innovation. it can be used as a tool to facilitate the uptake of such innovation, by serving as a source of delight for the user in the user experience. Radical innovation presents substantial obstacles both to usability and to usability testing [Rogers, Y. Rutherford, A. Bibby, P. 1992]. such innovation stops users in their tracks by intentionally frustrating expectations. Defamiliarization, as some recent research has argued, can respond to this problem by causing users to step back from the process they are engaged in (i.e., trying to engage with an interface) to experience features of the interface itself, and to gain pleasure and fun from that interaction [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005]. In the course of that step back, the innovative feature is discovered, and the user re-enters the primary process of &#8216;working with&#8217; the interface. A handful of designers are incorporating defamiliarization into their design strategies [Bell, Blythe, Sengers, 2005; Sengers, Gaver, 2006]. For instance, at Canonical, a major part of our design work on the Ubuntu operating system is concerned with &#8216;radical&#8217; innovation. We have substantial experience with such innovation threatening usability as it challenges conventions and habits. We have begun to employ defamiliarized user journeys as a facilitator of usability. There are two major aspects of this work. 1.Creating defamiliarized experiences that bring attention to the technology itself without introducing usability challenges, thereby supporting discovery; 2.Evaluating defamiliarization. A central question for us is. how can we assess this technique as part of usability testing and qualitative feedback? As the literature evidences, there are many ways to use defamiliarization in design. &#8226; juxtaposing incongruities &#8226; creating unexpected contexts &#8226; exaggerating information &#8226; providing minimal representations &#8226; creating ambiguity &#8226; using extreme characters There are other methods that practitioners have not recognised but that they may use implicitly. Workshop Goals Clarify ways defamiliarization can be successfully applied to interface design to create compelling experiences; Determine the reach and usefulness of defamiliarization for innovation; Explore techniques that enhance the role defamiliarization can play in ease of use -- bridging, cues, etc; Define user testing approaches to assess the success of defamiliarization efforts.",

As technology&#65533;s growth in domestic, social and intimate contexts suggests a new consideration of how identity is invoked, we propose to examine philosophical commitments, methodological implications, and pragmatic aspects of putting performativity to work, identifying blind spots and obstacles that hamper research and practice in this area. And we use hands-on critique, panel discussion and brief presentations, to explore how HCI can respond to the challenge of who we are and what we might become in our pursuit of digitally mediated futures.",

The aim of this workshop is to discuss the current (and near-future) technologies and create a research agenda for how we can design, implement and evaluate new and more natural interaction forms and interfaces for mobile devices.

Specific topics include psychologically based data, design methods and tools, user interface media and tools, and introduction to user interface architecture. In each, we will cover research, technology under development, and current application. Sources for follow-on information will be given. The intended audience is made up of professionals in computer-related fields who have not yet had a systematic exposure to the discipline of computer-human interaction, typically first-time attendees of the CHI conference. CHI professionals who wish to examine how their work relates to the field as a whole should also attend. Instructors' Background. Keith Butler is Principal Research Scientist and Affiliate Professor of Human Centered Design and Engineering at the University of Washington, where he leads research in health care informatics. Robert Jacob is Professor of Computer Science at Tufts University, where his research interests are new interaction media and techniques and user interface software. David Kieras is Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan, where he holds a joint appointment in Psychology.",

  "Abstract": "An aspect of social computing is to use information and communication technologies to support the formation and collective work of communities, whether they be enacted mostly offline or online. Supporting communities through computing technologies can help to facilitate a wide range of collective outcomes, ranging from engaged citizenship, knowledge management, health support and more. However, creating social computing platforms that support communities is also difficult, with points of potential collapse at any point in the lifestyle of a project. In this course, we will mix discussion of the research in this area with exercises designed to help attendees become aware of the opportunities in designing social computing platforms to support communities, as well as the complexities involved when those technologies intersect with multiple levels of human social systems. In the discussions, we&#8217;ll discuss conceptions of community from sociology, psychology and other social sciences. We&#8217;ll describe how using technology changes the traditional processes by how communities are formed and supported. We&#8217;ll describe the lifecycle of the social computing for community process, from goals to outcomes. Finally, we&#8217;ll discuss different generations of thought regarding technology-supported communities, and how the next generation of socio-technical design is likely to unfold. Exercises will include reading and discussion questions of several \"real-life\" examples of community design projects. In addition, attendees will work in groups with instructors to create a design proposal for an online community, using course concepts to define all stages of the creation of the project. At the end of this course, students should be able to define the goals of using technology to support communities, have an understanding of some best practices in approaching this overall issue, and be able to articulate (and avoid) common stumbling blocks in creating technology-enabled communities.",

  "Abstract": "The web has created opportunities for products to quickly reach markets in any part of the globe. How do you ensure that a product created for one market will be usable in others? It requires knowledge of how nationality, language, and cultural biases impact the design and use of technology products. Exposure to the variations in those respective areas is critical as is using a UX process that takes these variations into account from the beginning. This challenging issue will be discussed and illustrated through the use of humorous photographs and videos as well as drawing upon good and bad examples of recent technology products such as web sites, desktop software, mobile apps, and consumer electronics.",

  "Abstract": "Agile methods, Scrum in particular, are now widely used in the development community. UX professionals who work with Agile teams find that Agile approaches create roadblocks to their participation. Minimal up-front planning means there&#8217;s no time for user research or UX design; short sprints leave little time for considered interface design; and sprint reviews leave no place for usability testing or other validation of the sprint&#8217;s work. UX designers find that their old role relationships and procedures no longer work, their skills and techniques devalued, and there&#8217;s no clear guidance on how to contribute. But, looking at their base principles, Agile methods should be friendly to UX participation. Continuous user feedback is core to Agile&#8212;and who better to supply it than UX designers? But many Agile values and attitudes work against the needs of UX design. Agile methods were created by developers, for developers, without much consideration for user interaction. In this course, we arm UX designers with concepts and techniques enabling them to participate effectively in Agile projects. We show why Agile methods make sense from the developers&#8217; point of view&#8212;and how principles driving Agile methods can be used to support UX involvement. We also show where Agile methods work against the UX goal of a coherent, consistent interface and provide strategies to accomplish a coherent design anyway. We describe proven Agile/UX best practices for integrating the two perspectives. Finally, we step back and look at project scope. Agile methods address small-scale projects&#8212;how to scale them up is debated in the Agile community. We show how to plan a user-centered Agile project of any scale, from iterative fixes to whole systems",

  "Abstract": "Online communities are among the fastest growing sections of the Internet and provide members with information, companionship, social support and entertainment. Although as a class these online communities are very successful, the success of particular ones varies widely and many fail. To become or remain successful, online communities must meet a number of challenges that are common to offline as well as online groups and organizations. For example, online communities must handle the start-up challenge. early in their lifecycle they have few members to generate content and little content to attract members. Throughout their lifecycle, they must recruit and socialize newcomers, encourage commitment and contribution from members, solve problems of coordination and encourage appropriate behavior among members and interlopers alike. This tutorial is organized around two of these design challenges &#8211; starting a community and getting members to contribute to it. The social sciences can tell us a lot about how to make thriving online communities. Economics and various branches of psychology offer theories of individual motivation and of human behavior in social situations. Properly interpreted, they can inform choices about how to get a community started and motivate contributions. After taking this tutorial, students will appreciate the value of using social science research as the basis for social design. They will have had an introduction to the social science literature relevant to problems of encouraging contributions in online communities and starting a community from scratch. Through exercises, they will appreciate how to translate theory and evidence into designs. They will have pointers to where to learn more. The tutorial is based on the presenters&#8217; new book, Kraut & Resnick (2012). Building successful online communities. Evidence-based social design. Cambridge MA. MIT Press. Participants will receive prints of relevant book chapters.",

  "Abstract": "The most commonly reported approach to usability process improvement is for an organization to start with usability testing as this has recognized value, even though the benefits are limited by the difficulty of making significant improvements late in the lifecycle. The perceived benefits of testing are then used to gradually justify activities earlier in the lifecycle. The difficulty with this approach is that it usually only involves relatively junior management. When personnel change, or economies are being made in the organization the usability work can be vulnerable. The course will suggest a more structured approach to usability process improvement, by auditing the extent to which the good practice embodied in ISO TR 18529 is implemented in typical projects, and identifying areas for organizational improvement. The course recommends use of material from ISO standards not just because they are standards, but because they contain the most comprehensive and systematic information available, which represents the consensus of international experts in the field. Each ISO 18529 activity can be assessed as not done, partially done, largely done or fully done, as part of systems development. This can be carried out relatively informally in a process improvement workshop, or as part of a more formal process assessment of usability maturity (analogous to the software process assessment that can be carried out using the SEI CMM - Capability Maturity Model). This information enables an organization to decide how much improvement is desirable in particular areas, or on an activity-by-activity basis. Case studies will be presented of assessments of different degrees of formality that have been carried out in three organizations. The course is suitable for anyone interested in assessing usability maturity and improving usability capability. Basic familiarity with the area of user-centered design is assumed, but no prior knowledge of ISO standards is needed.",

  "Abstract": "If you don't measure it you can't manage it. User-research is about more than rules of thumb, good design and intuition. it's about making better decisions with data. Is Product A preferred more than Product B? Will more users complete tasks on the new design? Learn how to conduct and interpret appropriate statistical tests on small and large sample data then communicate your results in easy to understand terms to stakeholders. Features -- Get a visual introduction or refresher to the most important statistical concepts for applied use. -- Know which statistical test to use and when -- Be able to compare two interfaces or versions (A/B Testing) by showing statistical significance (e.g. Product A takes 20% less time to complete a task than Product B p <.05). -- Clearly understand both the limits and data available from small sample usability data through use of confidence intervals. Audience Open to anyone who's interested in quantitative user research. Participants should be familiar with the process of conducting usability tests or research as well as basic descriptive statistics such as the mean, median and standard deviation and have access to Microsoft Excel. Participants will receive an Excel calculator which will perform the statistical calculations. The presentation will be a mix of enthusiastic instruction, with movie-clips, pictures, demonstrations and interactive exercises all aimed at helping make the abstract topic of statistics concrete, memorable and actionable.",

  "Location": "Room 15",
  "Abstract": "Online communities are among the fastest growing sections of the Internet and provide members with information, companionship, social support and entertainment. Although as a class these online communities are very successful, the success of particular ones varies widely and many fail. To become or remain successful, online communities must meet a number of challenges that are common to offline as well as online groups and organizations. For example, online communities must handle the start-up challenge. early in their lifecycle they have few members to generate content and little content to attract members. Throughout their lifecycle, they must recruit and socialize newcomers, encourage commitment and contribution from members, solve problems of coordination and encourage appropriate behavior among members and interlopers alike. This tutorial is organized around two of these design challenges &#8211; starting a community and getting members to contribute to it. The social sciences can tell us a lot about how to make thriving online communities. Economics and various branches of psychology offer theories of individual motivation and of human behavior in social situations. Properly interpreted, they can inform choices about how to get a community started and motivate contributions. After taking this tutorial, students will appreciate the value of using social science research as the basis for social design. They will have had an introduction to the social science literature relevant to problems of encouraging contributions in online communities and starting a community from scratch. Through exercises, they will appreciate how to translate theory and evidence into designs. They will have pointers to where to learn more. The tutorial is based on the presenters&#8217; new book, Kraut & Resnick (2012). Building successful online communities. Evidence-based social design. Cambridge MA. MIT Press. Participants will receive prints of relevant book chapters.",

  "Abstract": "The most commonly reported approach to usability process improvement is for an organization to start with usability testing as this has recognized value, even though the benefits are limited by the difficulty of making significant improvements late in the lifecycle. The perceived benefits of testing are then used to gradually justify activities earlier in the lifecycle. The difficulty with this approach is that it usually only involves relatively junior management. When personnel change, or economies are being made in the organization the usability work can be vulnerable. The course will suggest a more structured approach to usability process improvement, by auditing the extent to which the good practice embodied in ISO TR 18529 is implemented in typical projects, and identifying areas for organizational improvement. The course recommends use of material from ISO standards not just because they are standards, but because they contain the most comprehensive and systematic information available, which represents the consensus of international experts in the field. Each ISO 18529 activity can be assessed as not done, partially done, largely done or fully done, as part of systems development. This can be carried out relatively informally in a process improvement workshop, or as part of a more formal process assessment of usability maturity (analogous to the software process assessment that can be carried out using the SEI CMM - Capability Maturity Model). This information enables an organization to decide how much improvement is desirable in particular areas, or on an activity-by-activity basis. Case studies will be presented of assessments of different degrees of formality that have been carried out in three organizations. The course is suitable for anyone interested in assessing usability maturity and improving usability capability. Basic familiarity with the area of user-centered design is assumed, but no prior knowledge of ISO standards is needed.",

Perhaps you have some idea and you think you&#8217; want to do research through design, or perhaps you think that research for design is more what you&#8217;re about? Based both on the recent work published at CHI and DIS (Zimmerman et al 2007 & Zimmerman et al 2010) as well as the work of Horvath (Horvath 2007, 2008) we&#8217;ll define the continuum of design research and how it relates to both classical mono-disciplinary research and design practice, we&#8217;ll help you find your way in the wonderful world of design research. This course is hands-on and while we do spend some time in lecture-mode we will spend a the majority of the time in disucssion and using the concept of prototyping to understand Design Research and where your own research fits into the whole thing. This course is aimed at early stage reserchers with 0-7 years experience, students (both MS and PhD) and anyone new to HCI, Design, or Design Research. This course is taught in two parts, and between the two sessions you will spend 10-30 minutes making your prototype. We provide all the materials, you provide your content. Attendance at both sessions is be necessary if you want to be able to follow what we will do in the course.This course has been taught as a required module for PhD students at Delft for several years as well as to a PhD summer school where students found it not only interesting, but very helpful to clarify their research program and where it fits into design research.",

  "Abstract": "With six billion cellular subscriptions, the mobile phone (or \"cellphone\") is an essential part of everyday life. It&#8217;s a business tool to clinch important deals; a \"remote control\" for the real world, helping us cope with daily travel delay frustrations; a \"relationship appliance\" to say goodnight to loved-ones when away from home; a community device to organize political demonstrations. This course is about applying interaction design approaches to the mobile arena. It provides an understanding of what makes for successful future mobile user experiences; ones that really connect with what people want, and operate in straightforward, satisfying ways. As a practice, interaction design owes much to the long-established discipline of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the associated usability industry. Interaction design, though, extends the mainstream practices. It is more about crafting the \"customer experience\" rather than a process that focuses on \"ease-of-use\". Interaction designers have to have passion and heart. whereas usability is often seen as a privative &#8211; something you only notice when it is not there &#8211; interaction design is about making a statement. This course is about shifting the mobile design perspective away from \"smart\" phones, to people who are smart, creative, busy, or plain bored. Our aim is to help attendees to provide users with future products and services that can change their (or even the whole) world. The course will both introduce interesting and empowering mobile design philosophies, principles and methods as well as giving specific guidance on key consumer application areas such as pedestrian navigation and location aware services. Our aim is to inspire attendees to strive for breathtakingly effective services. We want attendees to leave the course with a fresh perspective on their current projects and an eagerness to build a long-term better future for mobile users.",

Applying them effectively requires determining their applicability (and precedence) in specific situations. It also requires balancing the trade-offs that inevitably arise in situations when design rules appear to contradict each other. By understanding the underlying psychology for the design rules, designers and evaluators enhance their ability to interpret and apply them. Explaining that psychology is the focus of this two-part course. The first part focuses on perception; the second part focuses on cognition.",

However, there are challenges to successfully integrating the two. Issues include different mindsets, experiences, practices and goals which create a gulf between UX people and agile developers. Meridium Inc. has partnered with Virginia Tech with the support of an NSF STTR grant to find ways to integrate UX into agile teams. In our approach, extreme scenario-based design (XSBD), we combine elements from several agile and usability processes including XP, Scrum and scenario-based usability engineering. It has been successfully used at Meridium in several projects. In this course, our goal is to present our approach to integrating UX into agile as well as high level practices shared between the different integration approaches. We will encourage critical thinking, reflection and active discussion of the issues surrounding agile UX through a group-based hands-on design activity combined with retrospectives and sharing of real-world experiences.",

The CHI community has acknowledged children as important users by featuring an 'HCI for Kids' community this year. We believe that it is critical that the HCI community continue to lead the way in supporting the best possible design of technology for children. To this end, this course will offer a balance of traditional lecture and hands-on design activities, and will cover techniques which balance the voices and contributions of adults and children. We will also ground these techniques in information on the history of co-design with children, as well as child development as it relates to the design of technology for children. We will additionally focus on the roles of the adult in and intergenerational co-design team, including addressing practical issues of beginning a co-design team. This course will include a historical overview of co-designing with children. We will also address understanding how child development should be considered in technology design and the technology design process. The course will include hands-on experience using techniques for designing new technologies with and for children. It will also offer participants an understanding of the role of the adult in co-design processes with children, including consideration of practical issues in co-design. The audience for this course requires no special background. We welcome and encourage attendance by industry professionals, academics, and students from a wide variety of communities (e.g., design, computer science, information studies, and psychology).",

  "Abstract": "With six billion cellular subscriptions, the mobile phone (or \"cellphone\") is an essential part of everyday life. It&#8217;s a business tool to clinch important deals; a \"remote control\" for the real world, helping us cope with daily travel delay frustrations; a \"relationship appliance\" to say goodnight to loved-ones when away from home; a community device to organize political demonstrations. This course is about applying interaction design approaches to the mobile arena. It provides an understanding of what makes for successful future mobile user experiences; ones that really connect with what people want, and operate in straightforward, satisfying ways. As a practice, interaction design owes much to the long-established discipline of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and the associated usability industry. Interaction design, though, extends the mainstream practices. It is more about crafting the \"customer experience\" rather than a process that focuses on \"ease-of-use\". Interaction designers have to have passion and heart. whereas usability is often seen as a privative &#8211; something you only notice when it is not there &#8211; interaction design is about making a statement. This course is about shifting the mobile design perspective away from \"smart\" phones, to people who are smart, creative, busy, or plain bored. Our aim is to help attendees to provide users with future products and services that can change their (or even the whole) world. The course will both introduce interesting and empowering mobile design philosophies, principles and methods as well as giving specific guidance on key consumer application areas such as pedestrian navigation and location aware services. Our aim is to inspire attendees to strive for breathtakingly effective services. We want attendees to leave the course with a fresh perspective on their current projects and an eagerness to build a long-term better future for mobile users.",

  "Abstract": "UI design rules, guidelines, and heuristics are not simple recipes to be applied mindlessly. Applying them effectively requires determining their applicability (and precedence) in specific situations. It also requires balancing the trade-offs that inevitably arise in situations when design rules appear to contradict each other. By understanding the underlying psychology for the design rules, designers and evaluators enhance their ability to interpret and apply them. Explaining that psychology is the focus of this two-part course. The first part focuses on perception; the second part focuses on cognition.",

  "Abstract": "Many in the agile and user experience (UX) communities have identified the need to integrate UX into agile organizations. However, there are challenges to successfully integrating the two. Issues include different mindsets, experiences, practices and goals which create a gulf between UX people and agile developers. Meridium Inc. has partnered with Virginia Tech with the support of an NSF STTR grant to find ways to integrate UX into agile teams. In our approach, extreme scenario-based design (XSBD), we combine elements from several agile and usability processes including XP, Scrum and scenario-based usability engineering. It has been successfully used at Meridium in several projects. In this course, our goal is to present our approach to integrating UX into agile as well as high level practices shared between the different integration approaches. We will encourage critical thinking, reflection and active discussion of the issues surrounding agile UX through a group-based hands-on design activity combined with retrospectives and sharing of real-world experiences.",

To this end, this course will offer a balance of traditional lecture and hands-on design activities, and will cover techniques which balance the voices and contributions of adults and children. We will also ground these techniques in information on the history of co-design with children, as well as child development as it relates to the design of technology for children. We will additionally focus on the roles of the adult in and intergenerational co-design team, including addressing practical issues of beginning a co-design team. This course will include a historical overview of co-designing with children.

  "Abstract": "High quality user experience (UX) has become a central competitive factor of products in mature consumer markets. Improving UX during product development and research requires evaluation, but traditional usability testing methods are not adequate for evaluating UX. The evaluation methods for investigating how users feel about the tested system are still less known in the HCI community. Since 2008, the instructors have been collecting a comprehensive set of 80 UX evaluation methods both from academia and industry, which is now available at www.allaboutux.org/all-methods. This course will cover the following topics. - the general targets of UX evaluation - the various kinds of UX evaluation methods available for different purposes (an overview) - how to choose the right method for the purpose - the basics of a sample of UX methods of different types - guidance on where to find more information on those methods By the end of this course, you will be able to choose suitable methods for your specific user experience evaluation cases. Our target audience consists of researchers and practitioners who want to get acquainted with user experience evaluation methods. The participants should have basic understanding of the user-centered design process, and preferably experience on usability studies.",

  "Abstract": "You can&#8217;t just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they&#8217;ll want something new. This comment by Steve Jobs generated a heated discussion within the high tech community that continues to rage. It&#8217;s being held up as evidence that user-centered design is a waste of time, there&#8217;s no need to expend the effort needed to get customer input since they can&#8217;t tell you anything useful. Is Steve Jobs right? Only if you take his quote literally. Jobs is correct in saying that asking customers, \"What do you want?\" and then giving it to them is a prescription for failure. But what do we use instead as our source of innovation? Our own ideas based on our creativity? Or is there a better way? In this course, we show how the best ideas are produced when a designer&#8217;s inner \"design compass\" is educated by customer data. We discuss how successful innovation&#8212;practical innovation&#8212;arises from a deep understanding of customer needs. We explain how customer data is used to reveal customer needs, generate insights and produce designs that would not have otherwise happened. We show several real-world examples of how teams discovered new product ideas by using customer data, illustrated with the actual customer data and its connection to the new idea. Participants interact with actual customer data so they can experience its power for generating ideas",

  "Abstract": "Web applications with video content as well as television sets including network connections have become increasingly popular. The social nature of watching video and television drives developers of both types of applications to explore the integration of successful social media like Facebook or Twitter with streaming video. Moreover, several apps are being created for smartphones and tablets, which act as a second screen that allows remotely communicating with friends while watching. These types of applications can be called social TV, allowing remote viewers to interact with each other via the television set, smartphones, tablets or the PC. Features include remote talking or chatting while watching television, sending recommendations, leaving comments, showing what you watch or sharing video clips. This course studies current developments on social television and online video applications, providing participants first hand knowledge on how to analyze, design and evaluate them. The term &#8216;sociability&#8217; is used to indicate these interface aspects that support and enhance social interaction with and through new technologies and applications, and social interaction design is a way of including these sociability aspects in the design process. The specific nature of social video watching, such as enjoying a television program while communicating or using television content as conversation starter, warrant the use of a specific design process and guidelines, focusing on social interaction and sociability. During the course, participants will learn in a very practical way how to design and evaluate social features of these emergent applications. Based on their extensive experience in designing and performing user tests of social television, and using real world examples, the instructors will explain the practical issues and will highlight key challenges for the CHI community.",

  "Abstract": "High quality user experience (UX) has become a central competitive factor of products in mature consumer markets. Improving UX during product development and research requires evaluation, but traditional usability testing methods are not adequate for evaluating UX. The evaluation methods for investigating how users feel about the tested system are still less known in the HCI community. Since 2008, the instructors have been collecting a comprehensive set of 80 UX evaluation methods both from academia and industry, which is now available at www.allaboutux.org/all-methods. This course will cover the following topics. - the general targets of UX evaluation - the various kinds of UX evaluation methods available for different purposes (an overview) - how to choose the right method for the purpose - the basics of a sample of UX methods of different types - guidance on where to find more information on those methods By the end of this course, you will be able to choose suitable methods for your specific user experience evaluation cases. Our target audience consists of researchers and practitioners who want to get acquainted with user experience evaluation methods. The participants should have basic understanding of the user-centered design process, and preferably experience on usability studies.",

  "Abstract": "This tutorial aims to help user interface designers and developers to understand the issues involved in multi-device interactive applications, which can be accessed through mobile and stationary devices even exploiting different interaction modalities (graphical, vocal, &#8230;). It will provide a discussion of the possible solutions in terms of concepts, techniques, languages, and tools, with particular attention to Web environments. The tutorial will deal with the various strategies in order to adapt, distribute, and migrate the user interface according to the context of use. It will consider how to address such issues both when authoring multi-device interfaces and when user interfaces for different devices are dynamically adapted, distributed, or even migrated seamlessly across them to follow the mobile user. Thus, it will discuss task continuity across multiple devices in distributed and migratory interfaces and related usability issues. In particular, it will consider. - Issues in multi-device interfaces - The influence of the interaction platforms on the suitability of the possible tasks and their structure - Authoring multi-device interfaces - Types of rules for adapting user interfaces to different devices - Model-based design of multi-device interfaces - Approaches to automatic adaptation - How to address adaptation to various platforms with different modalities (graphical, vocal, &#8230;) - Distributed user interfaces - User interfaces able to migrate and preserve their state The tutorial will be interesting for interactive software developers and designers who want to understand the issues involved in multi-device interactive applications and the space of the possible solutions. Likewise, user interface designers would benefit in that they could work more effectively and make their choices more explicit in designing pervasive interactive services. In addition, other researchers who would like to have an update on the state of art and research results in the field will find the tutorial of interest.",

  "Abstract": "Web applications with video content as well as television sets including network connections have become increasingly popular. The social nature of watching video and television drives developers of both types of applications to explore the integration of successful social media like Facebook or Twitter with streaming video. Moreover, several apps are being created for smartphones and tablets, which act as a second screen that allows remotely communicating with friends while watching. These types of applications can be called social TV, allowing remote viewers to interact with each other via the television set, smartphones, tablets or the PC. Features include remote talking or chatting while watching television, sending recommendations, leaving comments, showing what you watch or sharing video clips. This course studies current developments on social television and online video applications, providing participants first hand knowledge on how to analyze, design and evaluate them. The term &#8216;sociability&#8217; is used to indicate these interface aspects that support and enhance social interaction with and through new technologies and applications, and social interaction design is a way of including these sociability aspects in the design process. The specific nature of social video watching, such as enjoying a television program while communicating or using television content as conversation starter, warrant the use of a specific design process and guidelines, focusing on social interaction and sociability. During the course, participants will learn in a very practical way how to design and evaluate social features of these emergent applications. Based on their extensive experience in designing and performing user tests of social television, and using real world examples, the instructors will explain the practical issues and will highlight key challenges for the CHI community.",

Based both on the recent work published at CHI and DIS (Zimmerman et al 2007 & Zimmerman et al 2010) as well as the work of Horvath (Horvath 2007, 2008) we&#8217;ll define the continuum of design research and how it relates to both classical mono-disciplinary research and design practice, we&#8217;ll help you find your way in the wonderful world of design research. This course is hands-on and while we do spend some time in lecture-mode we will spend a the majority of the time in disucssion and using the concept of prototyping to understand Design Research and where your own research fits into the whole thing. This course is aimed at early stage reserchers with 0-7 years experience, students (both MS and PhD) and anyone new to HCI, Design, or Design Research. This course is taught in two parts, and between the two sessions you will spend 10-30 minutes making your prototype. We provide all the materials, you provide your content. Attendance at both sessions is be necessary if you want to be able to follow what we will do in the course.This course has been taught as a required module for PhD students at Delft for several years as well as to a PhD summer school where students found it not only interesting, but very helpful to clarify their research program and where it fits into design research.",

  "Abstract": "People are constantly making small choices and larger decisions about their use of computing technology, such as. - 'Shall I use this new application as a replacement for my current one?' - 'Which privacy settings are best for me? Should I even take the trouble to figure them out?' - 'Shall I make a contribution to this on-line community?' - 'If so, which of the two available methods should I use?' The ways in which users make these 'preferential' choices can involve a wide range of processes, such as anticipation of consequences of actions, social influence, affective responses, and intuition based on prior learning. This course offers an up-to-date synthesis of relevant research in psychology, illustrated with HCI examples, that will enable you to analyze systematically the choices made by the users that you are interested in. This type of analysis will be useful in the design and interpretation of studies that involve users' preferential choices and in the generation of strategies for helping users to make better choices. ORIGINS. This course was successfully introduced at CHI 2011. FEATURES. - Discuss, with reference to concrete examples, representative types of choice and decision problem faced by users of computing technology. - Learn how to go beyond current HCI analyses of these problems by applying concepts and results from several relevant areas of psychological research. - Take away supplementary materials that expand on the discussion in the course and help you to apply its analytical framework in your own work. AUDIENCE. HCI researchers, students, and practitioners who want to understand and support the choices and decisions of users of the systems that they design or study. PRESENTATION. Lecture segments + familiarization with worksheets designed for later independent use. COURSE WEBSITE. http.//dfki.de/~jameson/chi12-course-jameson/",

  "Abstract": "Research and Design for Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an essential focus for the CHI community, but the topic presents unique challenges in its definition, its concrete impact on User Experience as a discipline and field of research, and its tactical implementation in day-to-day practitioners&#8217; work. In this advanced course, we will briefly recap the key learnings of the related CHI course &#8216;Introduction to Research and Design for Sustainability&#8217;, and will then focus on helping participants internalize and solidify those learnings in studio-style exercises, in which we introduce well- scoped case study problems to the participants to apply specific sustainability research and design frameworks, methods, and approaches. This course targets researchers as well as practitioners alike, who are currently working in, or are interested in the field of Research and Design for Sustainability. Even though the course will touch on industrial/product design for sustainability, its main focus will be on software products and holistic experiences. Experienced researchers or professionals are welcome to participate in this course, as are those having attended the related &#8216;Introduction to Research and Design for Sustainability&#8217;. Both instructors have been involved in Sustainable Research and Design for a number of years, one in a research and educational setting (at Indiana University - Bloomington), the other in a corporate R&D environment (most recently at Samsung Research). Eli Blevis leads the Sustainable Interaction Design research group at Indiana. Daniela Busse has been working on various Sustainability projects since 2006 (e.g. on Energy Management, Carbon Labeling, Business Design for Sustainability). Both have co-authored several CHI panels, workshops and a SIG on sustainable HCI, were invited speakers at the National Science Foundation Workshop for an HCI & Sustainability research agenda in 2010, and are recognized as leading figures in Sustainable HCI.",

Unfortunately, this step is often skipped in software development. Many designers jump right into sketching and prototyping the UI before they understand the application at a conceptual level. The result is incoherent, overly-complex applications that expose concepts that are irrelevant to the users&#8217; tasks. This course covers. - What conceptual models are, and how they can improve the UI design process, - Perils and pitfalls of not designing a conceptual model, - Object/actions analysis (part of designing a conceptual model), - An example conceptual model for a specific application, - Benefits of Conceptual Analysis. object taxonomy, lexicon, task scenarios, object-model, - A hands-on exercise in performing Object/Actions analysis for a simple application.",

Although prior experience with agile methods is not needed, there will be only a brief background description of agile methodology, so prior knowledge of these methods would be an asset. The course does not focus on a particular agile methodology. We will teach agile adaptations to the timing, granularity, and communication of user centred design methods, with a particular focus on methods to interactively elicit observed user behavior (such as contextual inquiry, and formative usability testing and rapid prototyping). Participants in this tutorial will learn. &#8226; advantages of a healthy agile UX practice over waterfall UX &#8226; skills and attitudes to hone to do user-centred design on an agile team &#8226; how to collaborate with other agile team members &#8226; parallel-track/\"staggered sprint\" timing of agile UX activities &#8226; how to break both UX work and design implementation into iteration-sized chunks &#8226; tactics for incorporating user research into agile projects &#8226; how to communicate effectively with agile teams &#8226; some suggestions for improving non-co-located agile teamwork",

  "Abstract": "People are constantly making small choices and larger decisions about their use of computing technology, such as. - 'Shall I use this new application as a replacement for my current one?' - 'Which privacy settings are best for me? Should I even take the trouble to figure them out?' - 'Shall I make a contribution to this on-line community?' - 'If so, which of the two available methods should I use?' The ways in which users make these 'preferential' choices can involve a wide range of processes, such as anticipation of consequences of actions, social influence, affective responses, and intuition based on prior learning. This course offers an up-to-date synthesis of relevant research in psychology, illustrated with HCI examples, that will enable you to analyze systematically the choices made by the users that you are interested in. This type of analysis will be useful in the design and interpretation of studies that involve users' preferential choices and in the generation of strategies for helping users to make better choices. ORIGINS. This course was successfully introduced at CHI 2011. FEATURES. - Discuss, with reference to concrete examples, representative types of choice and decision problem faced by users of computing technology. - Learn how to go beyond current HCI analyses of these problems by applying concepts and results from several relevant areas of psychological research. - Take away supplementary materials that expand on the discussion in the course and help you to apply its analytical framework in your own work. AUDIENCE. HCI researchers, students, and practitioners who want to understand and support the choices and decisions of users of the systems that they design or study. PRESENTATION. Lecture segments + familiarization with worksheets designed for later independent use. COURSE WEBSITE. http.//dfki.de/~jameson/chi12-course-jameson/",

  "Abstract": "Research and Design for Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an essential focus for the CHI community, but the topic presents unique challenges in its definition, its concrete impact on User Experience as a discipline and field of research, and its tactical implementation in day-to-day practitioners&#8217; work. In this advanced course, we will briefly recap the key learnings of the related CHI course &#8216;Introduction to Research and Design for Sustainability&#8217;, and will then focus on helping participants internalize and solidify those learnings in studio-style exercises, in which we introduce well- scoped case study problems to the participants to apply specific sustainability research and design frameworks, methods, and approaches. This course targets researchers as well as practitioners alike, who are currently working in, or are interested in the field of Research and Design for Sustainability. Even though the course will touch on industrial/product design for sustainability, its main focus will be on software products and holistic experiences. Experienced researchers or professionals are welcome to participate in this course, as are those having attended the related &#8216;Introduction to Research and Design for Sustainability&#8217;. Both instructors have been involved in Sustainable Research and Design for a number of years, one in a research and educational setting (at Indiana University - Bloomington), the other in a corporate R&D environment (most recently at Samsung Research). Eli Blevis leads the Sustainable Interaction Design research group at Indiana. Daniela Busse has been working on various Sustainability projects since 2006 (e.g. on Energy Management, Carbon Labeling, Business Design for Sustainability). Both have co-authored several CHI panels, workshops and a SIG on sustainable HCI, were invited speakers at the National Science Foundation Workshop for an HCI & Sustainability research agenda in 2010, and are recognized as leading figures in Sustainable HCI.",

Unfortunately, this step is often skipped in software development. Many designers jump right into sketching and prototyping the UI before they understand the application at a conceptual level. The result is incoherent, overly-complex applications that expose concepts that are irrelevant to the users&#8217; tasks. This course covers. - What conceptual models are, and how they can improve the UI design process, - Perils and pitfalls of not designing a conceptual model, - Object/actions analysis (part of designing a conceptual model), - An example conceptual model for a specific application, - Benefits of Conceptual Analysis. object taxonomy, lexicon, task scenarios, object-model, - A hands-on exercise in performing Object/Actions analysis for a simple application.",

  "Abstract": "Speech remains the 'holy grail' of interaction, as this is the most natural form of communication that humans employ. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. While the accuracies of understanding speech input are still discouraging for many applications under less-than-ideal conditions, several interesting areas are yet to be explored that could make speech-based interaction truly hands-free. The goal of this course is to inform the HCI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for HCI researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition works, what are its limitations, and how it could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms.",

  "Abstract": "One novel part of the design of interactions between people and computers, related with the facet of securing user satisfaction, is the capability of systems to adapt to their individual users showing empathy. Being empathetic implies that the computer is able to recognize user&#8217;s affective states and understand the implication of those states. Automatic detection of affective states requires the computer. to sense information; to process and understand information integrating several sources that could range from brain-waves signals and biofeedback readings, passing from gestures recognition, to posture and pressure sensing; and to apply algorithms and data processing tools to understand user&#8217;s affective states. Through this course, attendees will. a) Learn about sensing approaches used to detect affective states. brain-computer interfaces, face-based emotion recognition systems, eye-tracking system, and physiological sensors &#8211;including skin conductivity, posture, and pressure sensors&#8212;. b) Understand the pros and cons of the diverse sensing approaches used to detect affective states. c) Learn about the data that is gathered from each device and understand its characteristics. d) Learn about approaches and tools to pre-process, synchronize, and analyze data. This course is open to researchers, practitioners, and educators interested in incorporating affective computing as part of their adaptive and personalized technology toolbox. The presentation will be a mix of enthusiastic instruction with demonstrations and exercises, all aimed to help making the topic concrete, memorable, and actionable.",

Making products and applications learnable, efficient and pleasant to use are certainly goals, but every designer dreams of creating something more &#65533;something so great that people crave it, long for it, must have it. Marketers call it &#65533;a must have&#65533;, &#65533;compelling&#65533;, or &#65533;insanely great&#65533;. But most of the rest of us just call it Cool. Over the past decades, Cool has evolved into a marketing imperative. an overarching requirement for many designs. Companies spend billions organizing to cultivate &#65533;innovation&#65533; so they can reliably create it. And a new generation, with vastly different expectations on Cool design, is coming of age. But Cool is hard to pin down&#65533;there&#65533;s no accepted way to define it, measure it, or design for it. Like glamour, it is an ineffable yet powerful quality depending on a host of subtle factors. This course presents a set of core attributes that make products and applications Cool. These design attributes emerged from an extensive cross-generational contextual research project understanding how people from ages 15 to 60 experience &#65533;cool&#65533; and its relationship to value and impact on their lives. We present core Cool concepts based on the research, using real product and service examples to illustrate the material. We include the application of Cool concepts to productivity business applications. Attendees participate in an exercise to evaluate products they use, own and/or are designing to how Cool attributes apply and affect them. We end with an analysis of the development of key cool technologies revealing the real effort required to create cool products.

  "Abstract": "One novel part of the design of interactions between people and computers, related with the facet of securing user satisfaction, is the capability of systems to adapt to their individual users showing empathy. Being empathetic implies that the computer is able to recognize user&#8217;s affective states and understand the implication of those states. Automatic detection of affective states requires the computer. to sense information; to process and understand information integrating several sources that could range from brain-waves signals and biofeedback readings, passing from gestures recognition, to posture and pressure sensing; and to apply algorithms and data processing tools to understand user&#8217;s affective states. Through this course, attendees will. a) Learn about sensing approaches used to detect affective states. brain-computer interfaces, face-based emotion recognition systems, eye-tracking system, and physiological sensors &#8211;including skin conductivity, posture, and pressure sensors&#8212;. b) Understand the pros and cons of the diverse sensing approaches used to detect affective states. c) Learn about the data that is gathered from each device and understand its characteristics. d) Learn about approaches and tools to pre-process, synchronize, and analyze data. This course is open to researchers, practitioners, and educators interested in incorporating affective computing as part of their adaptive and personalized technology toolbox. The presentation will be a mix of enthusiastic instruction with demonstrations and exercises, all aimed to help making the topic concrete, memorable, and actionable.",

  "Abstract": "Since manual creation of user interfaces (UIs) is hard and expensive, automated generation may become more and more important in the future. Instead of generating UIs from simple abstractions, transforming them from high-level models should be more attractive. This course shows how human-computer interaction can be based on discourse modeling, even without employing speech or natural language. This topic is innovative, since it treats HCI interaction design and user-interface generation on the level of human-human communication. Communicative acts as abstractions from speech acts can model basic building blocks (\"atoms\") of communication, like a question or an answer. When, e.g., a question and an answer are glued together as a so-called adjacency pair, a simple \"molecule\" of a dialogue is modeled. Deliberately complex discourse structures can be modeled using relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The content of a communicative act can refer to ontologies of the domain of discourse. Taking all this together, we created a new discourse metamodel that specifies what discourse models may look like. Such discourse models can specify a communicative interaction design. In this course, this modeling approach is explained in some detail, with a focus on the discourse models. Exercises both of understanding and creating such models are included as well. This course also demonstrates how such an interaction design can be used for automated user-interface generation. This is based on model-transformation rules according to the model-driven architecture.

  "Day": "5/10/2012",
  "Time": "9:30 am - 10:50 am",
  "Location": "Room 13A",
  "Abstract": "Prototyping tools are making it easier to explore a design space so many different ideas can be generated and discussed, but evaluating those ideas to understand whether they are better, as opposed to just different, is still an intensely human task. User testing, concept validation, focus groups, design walkthroughs, all are expensive in both people's time and real dollars. Just as crash dummies in the automotive industry save lives by testing the physical safety of automobiles before they are brought to market, cognitive crash dummies save time, money, and potentially even lives, by allowing designers to automatically test their design ideas before implementing them. Cognitive crash dummies are models of human performance that make quantitative predictions of human behavior on proposed systems without the expense of empirical studies on running prototypes. When cognitive crash dummies are built into prototyping tools, design ideas can be rapidly expressed and easily evaluated. This course reviews the state of the art of predictive modeling and presents a tool that integrates rapid prototyping with modeling. Participants will bring their own laptops and learn to mock-up an interactive system and create a model of skilled performance on that mock-up. The course ends with a review of other tools and a look to the future of predictive modeling. AUDIENCE Designers, usability professionals and software developers who want to evaluate alternative designs alternatives. No prior knowledge of prototyping, psychology or predictive human performance modeling is required. INSTRUCTOR Dr. Bonnie E. John has more than 25 years experience in HCI. A CHI Academy member now at IBM Research, Dr. John was head of CMU's Masters Program in HCI for a dozen years, researches both human performance modeling and software engineering, and has consulted regularly in government and industry.

  "Abstract": "Prototyping tools are making it easier to explore a design space so many different ideas can be generated and discussed, but evaluating those ideas to understand whether they are better, as opposed to just different, is still an intensely human task. User testing, concept validation, focus groups, design walkthroughs, all are expensive in both people's time and real dollars. Just as crash dummies in the automotive industry save lives by testing the physical safety of automobiles before they are brought to market, cognitive crash dummies save time, money, and potentially even lives, by allowing designers to automatically test their design ideas before implementing them. Cognitive crash dummies are models of human performance that make quantitative predictions of human behavior on proposed systems without the expense of empirical studies on running prototypes. When cognitive crash dummies are built into prototyping tools, design ideas can be rapidly expressed and easily evaluated. This course reviews the state of the art of predictive modeling and presents a tool that integrates rapid prototyping with modeling. Participants will bring their own laptops and learn to mock-up an interactive system and create a model of skilled performance on that mock-up. The course ends with a review of other tools and a look to the future of predictive modeling. AUDIENCE Designers, usability professionals and software developers who want to evaluate alternative designs alternatives. No prior knowledge of prototyping, psychology or predictive human performance modeling is required. INSTRUCTOR Dr. Bonnie E. John has more than 25 years experience in HCI. A CHI Academy member now at IBM Research, Dr. John was head of CMU's Masters Program in HCI for a dozen years, researches both human performance modeling and software engineering, and has consulted regularly in government and industry. She has taught CHI courses since 1992.",

In this course the attendees will learn a design and execution of empirical experiments to evaluate experience of mobile applications used in different contexts of daily life, as opposite to (theoretical) application&#8217;s simulation or modeling. The methodology is based on a mixed methods approach. qualitative and quantitative methods. This course firstly presents a generic methodology for measurements-based performance evaluation of a mobile communication system and its service(s), and for evaluation of user experience, and second, it presents two case studies of application of this methodology. The performance evaluation aims at analysis of, for example, mobile system bottleneck or scalability characteristics, or at analysis of its application response time, as these metrics contribute to the overall experience of the mobile service use. The presented methodology has been derived from previous studies on performance of communication networks and QoE/QoS evaluation in a large-scale user studies using Experience Sampling Method and Day Reconstruction Methods. The methodology includes detailed steps for objectives determination, system instrumentation, and measurements execution and performance evaluation activities. The course illustrates use of the methodology for a performance evaluation of MobiHealth system and its vital sign tele-monitoring service provided to a mobile patient wearing a Wireless Body Area Network, and for entertainment, information and communication applications evaluated in a large-scale Android users study.",

  "Abstract": "The problem with previous approaches to the selection of UCD methods is that they start with the method, rather than the purpose for which the method is used. The tool uses the detailed set of human centered activities in ISO TS 18152 as a basis for prioritizing human centered design activities and identifying the types of methods to use. It then uses criteria based on ISO TR 16982 to identify which method is most appropriate. Creating a tool has made it practical to apply the comprehensive but complex principles in these standards. The course will explain the process, supported by the Usability Planner tool. 1. Identify the human centered design activities that are relevant for a particular project. 2. Select from a checklist the objectives and constraints associated with the project, including the importance of usability, the budget, timescales, skills available and the user and task characteristics. 3. Optionally prioritize the human centered design activities, based on an assessment of either the estimated cost benefits, or the importance of reducing project risk. 4. The tool will then recommend the most appropriate methods for each activity, in a prioritized list of activities. Further information is provided about each method, including links to the Usability Body of Knowledge. Audience &#8226; Usability specialists and project managers who need to justify UCD activities, or who want to broaden the range of methods that they use, or who want advice on which methods to use in a new situation. &#8226; Educators and trainers who help students decide which methods to use. &#8226; Anyone who is interested in a more systematic approach to user-centered design. Some familiarity with usability and user centered design is assumed, but no specific prior knowledge is needed. Usability Planner is available at http.//www.usabilityplanner.org/",

  "Location": "Room 15",
  "Abstract": "This 80-minute course is an &#65533;advanced class&#65533; on designing Conceptual Models, and is intended as a companion to Jeff Johnson&#65533;s introductory course &#65533;Designing What to Design. a Task-Focused Conceptual Model&#65533;. Both courses are based on the position that a good conceptual model should be a central concern of application developers. A conceptual model can act as a basis for clear thinking while designing, as a basis for the keeping development coherent and &#65533;clean&#65533;, and - most importantly - providing a user with the resources they need to support their work. This more advanced course addresses a collection of specific issues in building good conceptual models. It discusses both essential issues - ones that an application design must address (e.g., object/operation modeling, supporting learning, CM vs UI, object identity including synchronizing and saving), and also optional issues - ones that a design can choose to address in order to achieve better usability (e.g., trouble handling, macros, growing the application including both anticipated and unanticipated evolution). The course suggests a simple six-step practice for developing conceptual models. identify the issue, design user behavior (use case), give examples of usage (scenario), define user needs (resources), define the conceptual model to deliver these resource, retell the examples using the CM (scenario + CM). Participants will work in small groups to experience building a conceptual model to address an issue of their choice. Difficulties that arise will be shared in a whole-group discussion. This course is intended for those engaged in designing applications in circumstances of all kinds. Through presentation, small group design, and whole-group discussion, the course provides designers with the chance to explore some of the harder problems of building conceptual models.",
