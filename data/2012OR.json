  "Abstract": "Repository Basics - Getting Started with Islandora \n\nLength of Session (.5 day) \n\nAttendees accommodated (40) \n\nTechnology and facility requirements (Wireless Internet/Computer Lab) \n\nAny other supplies or support required (None. Attendee laptops optional.) \n\n* Overview \n\nIslandora is a digital asset management system that provides out-of-the-box repository solutions (Solution Packs) for a wide range of digital collections and research domains. Islandora combines the Drupal CMS and the Fedora repository software, together with additional open source applications (including Solr), to deliver a wide range of functionality. The proposed workshop will provide users with information about the Islandora software framework, and allow users to test drive a full Islandora installation using the online Islandora sandbox. \n\nAfter the system overview (including a review of the 2012/13 Roadmap for Solution Packs and new features) the instructors will lead participants through the basic functions of an Islandora installation, including new features introduced over the past year. The instructors will make themselves available for the 2nd half of the session and throughout the conference for additional advice/information on running Islandora. \n\nThis session is intended for all audiences and levels. No prior knowledge of Islandora or repositories is required. If users wish, they can come with digital objects they would like to add (PDF or image collections preferred) and describe in a repository, although sample collections will be provided. \n\nThe session will end with a brief description of how the community can participate in the development of the Islandora ecosystem, including code contributions, content models, documentation and more. \n\n* Learning Outcomes \n\n** Users can create a collection in Islandora, upload objects to the collection, and manage the collection using a suite of collection management tools. \n\n** Users understand basic Islandora technologies, and sources for support and additional documentation. \n\n** Users understand and have the opportunity to utilize collaborative research features in a repository."

  "Abstract": "OERPub is a new API for publishing OER (Open Education Resources) that was adapted lightly from SWORD V2. The purpose for the OERPub API is to enable an ecosystem of tools and services that support transforming, remixing, adapting, and translating OER. \n\nFeatures were added to SWORD to specialize it for OER and it has been implemented in Connexions (an open repository). We have also created a client that transforms content in general purposes formats like Word, Open Office, HTML, and Google Docs into semantic formats and then uses the API to publish the resulting content. When institutional authors submit scholarly works such as textbooks, conference proceedings, or journal articles to Connexions, they often need to archive the materials within their institutional arrchives (DSpace Fedora, Eprints). \n\nIn this workshop we will extend the OERPub client to optionally deposit to DSpace institutional archives using SWORD V2 at the same time as the materials are being published in Connexions. The first part of the workshop will be spent on design discussion, and then we will extend the client to deposit to both Connexions and DSpace. If participants are interested in EPrints or Fedora, we will pursue prototype implementations for those also. Attendees should be familiar with SWORD for publishing and an institutional repository. Since we will be actively extending existing software, software development skills or user experience skills will be priority for attendees. \n\nPresenters.

  "Abstract": "DSpace XMLUI has replaced the older DSpace user interface option, JSPUI, as the de-facto standard, at least when it comes to receiving new features. XMLUI -- also called Manakin -- offers very powerful options for customising the look and feel of a DSpace repository. Unfortunately, this power comes at the price of complexity and a rather steep learning curve. \n\nThis full-day workshop is targeted towards Repository Managers and people in similar roles who are somewhat technically inclined but are not necessarily software developers or coders. The goal of the workshop is to teach the participants hands-on skills to customise DSpace XMLUI while writing minimal code (or none at all)."

  "Abstract": "Many research datasets could be profitably reanalyzed, but are in danger of being lost since they are never properly archived. Institutional Repositories are charged with preserving scholarly products, but not all feel prepared to curate and archive research data. Institution-wide data repositories may co-exist with others within and beyond their institution, subject-based archives serving national and international communities, and publisher repositories. The workshop will offer service providers in these contexts a snapshot of the current landscape, and share examples, models and metaphors to help plan future development. We aim to map points of consensus and concern around repository roles in supporting data reuse and developing the infrastructure for that. \n\nThe workshop includes short presentations but the emphasis is on informal and open discussion. \n\nPresentations will include. an overview of the UK landscape by Simon Hodson, JISC Programme Manager 'Managing Research Data'; plus ICPSR’s project to team with IRs to curate and preserve social science data; Digital Curation Centre’s programme of ‘institutional engagements’; and developments at the Universities of Bath, Oxford, and Hull.

  "Abstract": "How we did it in the UK and where we’re going. The UK has been fortunate in having support from JISC and projects like the RSP to build a national infrastructure. This workshop looks at what we did and how we went about it and we hope give some pointers to the way networks can be supported and develop elsewhere. \n\nThis workshop will showcase research repositories in UK higher education. It would demonstrate how widespread the network is, how coordinated the UK is as a community, what the Repositories Support Project has done to encourage this, the role of United Kingdom Council of Research Repositories and what JISC has done in terms of a national approach to support and development. \n\nDelegates from outside the UK will have the opportunity to get an in depth understanding of the repository network in the UK and also to talk to repository staff about their experiences of integrating the repository into the institution. No specialist knowledge or skills are required. \n\nWorkshop outline. \n\n* Introduction by JISC to the programmes which have supported repository development over the last seven years and to future plans for repository development and support in the UK – including the UKRepositoryNet+ service. \n\n* The current picture of UK repositories and the work of the RSP in supporting them. \n\n* The role of UKCoRR (United Kingdom Council of Research Repositories) \n\nThere will then be a number of concurrent sessions where UK staff will use their institutions as a case study to engender discussion about what can be achieved. They will focus on two main themes. \n\n* The integration of research repositories with university systems, processes and policies especially those connected with research management. \n\n* Projects and initiatives to promote the repository within the institution in order to increase the deposit of full text items. This will have multi-disciplinary focus and include arts and humanities content as well as STEM subjects. \n\nOrganised and led by. \n\n* Repositories Support Project \n\nThe Repositories Support Project, a JISC-funded initiative which aims to increase open access to research outputs through building repository capacity, knowledge and skills within UK higher education institutions. It provides advice and guidance through face to face support and through its website and publications. In addition, it organises regular events and training for UK higher education staff."

  "Authors": ["Paul Walk", "Emma Tonkin", "Torsten Reimer"],
  "Affiliations": ["UKOLN ISC, University of Bath, United Kingdom"],
  "Abstract": "Text mining tools and technologies have a long history in the repository world,where they have been applied successfully for a variety of purposes. These vary from pragmatic aims such as enabling document search and browse facilities, linking related documents, identifying copies or facilitating the deposit process, to support tools for academic research. The latter category includes supporting research on the basis of a large body of documents, facilitating access to and reuse of existing work, and connecting the formal academic world with areas such as the traditional and social media. The Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) have funded a number of projects and initiatives in both areas, notably NaCTeM and the ResDis programme. Research areas as diverse as biology, chemistry, sociology and criminology have seen effective use made of text mining technologies. \n\nHowever, the uptake and hence the impact of these tools has been uneven. Several obstacles to development and deployment are frequently cited, including the maturity, complexity, and in some instances cost of software packages, as well as scarcity of relevant technical skills. Text mining methods and tools can be fragile and complex, requiring significant set-up time and effort. Projects making use of text mining may also suffer from legal obstacles, such as copyright and intellectual property considerations. The benefit to be gained from deployment of text-mining tools in areas such as institutional repositories or as a research tool in its own right may be difficult to predict without a costly pilot project. \n\nA horizon scan of the current text mining environment is to be carried out in Spring 2012, collecting viewpoints from JISC-funded projects, academia and industry on how a broad variety of text mining tools, techniques and approaches can directly benefit the end user. In particular, the reviewers focus on achievable goals and ensuring minimal overhead. \n\nThis workshop brings the authors from this publication face-to-face with participants, and will begin with presentations describing a variety of text mining applications, each of which will focus upon practically achievable use cases, tools, and outcomes. Attendees will learn about available tools, technologies, and methods, and will have time to discuss their own use cases with the workshop presenters. Presenters are encouraged to provide hands-on experience with the tools that they have developed and used."

  "Authors": ["Eloy Rodrigues"],
  "Affiliations": ["Confederation of Open Access Repositories"],
  "Abstract": "Open Access repositories, whose number has been steadily rising, are an important component of the global e-Research infrastructure. But each individual repository is of limited significance for research, as the real value of repositories lies in the potential to interconnect them to create a network of repositories, a network that can provide unified access to research outputs, be (re-) used by machines and researchers and provide the basis for developing value-added services. However, in order to achieve this potential, we need interoperability. Over the past year, members of the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) have been working to develop a framework – the COAR Interoperability Roadmap – in an effort to support repository managers and administrators as they work through the host of issues related to interoperability – how and where to get started with interoperability implementations, what services interoperability can support, and how to enhance existing repository implementations by adding new services through emerging developments within interoperability. \n\nBased on the first public draft version of the COAR Interoperability Roadmap, (available June 2012), this workshop will present an overview of the current and emerging services that interoperability initiatives make possible. We will cover interoperability standards and protocols in connection to these services. Examples of services that will be covered include. usage statistics, mass ingest processes, web standards compliance, maximizing web visibility, support for international and regional networks, and integrating repositories into research administration workflows. \n\nIn short, this workshop will help participants to make sense of the interoperability landscape, learn understand which standards and protocols support which services, and how to develop a strategy for interoperability at their institutions. \n\nAs part of the workshop, we will engage participants in a dialogue and seek input to consider before the final version of the COAR Interoperability Roadmap is released."

  "Abstract": "EThOS is the national e-theses database that aggregates metadata and full-text theses of the UK’s HE institutions. The workshop will examine interoperability challenges between EThOS and the 100+ IRs which it supports. It will be a chance for the EThOS team to report on recent developments, and for repository managers and EThOS contacts to share knowledge about EThOS procedures and issues. Outcomes from the workshop might be a \"Top 10\" hints for repository managers to take back to their institution, a \"Top 10\" quick fixes for the EThOS developers to take away, and a longer term wish-list to help with future EThOS planning. \n\nIt will consist of two parts. \n\nPart 1. A round-up presentation of recent progress by BL colleagues, followed by discussion on specific areas of EThOS as defined by the participants. We’ll gather questions and areas for discussion in advance via listservs, and use those as the basis for a panel discussion and Q&A session. \n\nPart 2. Community-developed technical solutions. A quick fire round-up of technical solutions that are being developed by repository tech teams in universities. See what solutions colleagues are working on, learn how you can use or develop them further, ask technical questions to help get the most out of EThOS.

This rapid development has fulfilled our original aims. to streamline the deposit process; increase content through digitisation; disseminate content to demonstrate Durham research excellence. \n\nEThOS plays a crucial role in enlarging our external audience and increasing our content through the digitisation service. We were among the first to interoperate with EThOS in both directions, being harvested by the OAI-PMH protocol, as well as developing a procedure for mass download through web services. We will present what technical challenges we overcame to publish digitised content in our service and how we set up the underlying EPrints software to play nicely with the harvesting process, to avoid record duplication or embargoed metadata leaking. Our Java compatible mass download tool could be easily adopted in other repositories such as Fedora or DSpace. \n\nChris Awre, University of Hull \n\nFedora, EThOS and the Hull experience \n\nFedora has enabled us to manage our small-ish e-thesis collection in a flexible manner. Using Fedoraÿÿs OAI-PMH interface we have been successfully harvested by EThOS, but are keen to further develop other interoperability routes. We have not yet moved towards bulk download, but do have questions/needs around managing complex e-theses (or enhanced publications) and addressing corrections to files. \n\nPresenters.

  "Type": "Workshops",
  "Key": "TheplaceofSoftwareinResearchDataManagementandRepositories",
  "Authors": ["Neil Chue Hong"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom"],
  "Abstract": "In recent years, scientific research has been augmented by the use of computer software for data capture, simulation, data analysis, and more. It has increasingly focused on the use of software carried out by communities of researchers that span disciplines, laboratories, organisations, and national boundaries. This permeation of the use of software into the mainstream of research across all disciplines has meant that it is increasingly difficult to reproduce and reuse the work of other researchers. The reproducible research principle requires the full computational environment to be published as well as the paper where the results are reported. \n\nThis raises the question of whether the current preservation policies and digital repositories are capable of handling software as a digital object that requires preservation. Whilst many of the mechanisms developed to handle datasets could be applied to software, there are certain features of software that make it a special edge case of a digital object. \n\nThis workshop will focus on the technical and policy issues regarding the deposit of software in repositories, as well as identifying how software residing in repositories could be made available and linked to datasets and publications. It will also assess the current and desired place of software in research data management policies. A panel will discuss current approaches, and then participants will be encouraged to contribute to the generation of a set of recommendations for repository owners, repository developers, and researchers developing software. \n\nBy bringing together those with an interest in ensuring the longer term development and use of software for research, including researchers, developers, research computing specialists, software engineers, and repository owners, the goal of this workshop is to understand what changes are required to facilitate the promotion of software to a first class digital object and research output."

  "Authors": ["Stacy T Kowalczyk", "Beth Plale"],
  "Affiliations": ["Indiana University, United States of America"],
  "Abstract": "Workflow systems can help librarians, technologists, and repository managers streamline processing by integrating existing, well known software (such as JHOVE ) with repository specific needs. At ingest, workflow systems can orchestrate processes to verify and validate formats, create derivative files, and create structural and administrative metadata. Workflows can automate a wide variety of preservation actions such as format normalization, metadata extraction from data files, and provenance and preservation metadata generation. Curation processes such as fixity verification, format migration, and preservation metadata updates can be automated with workflows as well. In addition to the administrative functions of ingest, preservation, and curation, workflows can provide additional functionality for dissemination processes such as converting file formats on demand for rendering, providing \"snippets\" of data files for discovery, and packaging numerous large files into a single compressed file, such as zip or tar, for faster and more efficient delivery. \n\nThis 3-hour workshop will provide an overview of workflow systems, a set of generic workflow components specifically developed for ingest, preservation, curation and ongoing access to materials that can be re-used by the workshop participants in their own repositories, hands-on experience using the Trident Workflow Workbench to compose workflows using the preservation and curation components provided, and a roadmap to creating customized components."

  "Abstract": "\"Tim O'Reilly, says it best. \"Innovation is no longer about who has the most gifted scientists or best equipped labs. It's about who has the best architecture of participation.\" Open source is the most viable means through which a higher education institution can create this ‘architecture of participation.’\" \n\n~ From Jim Whitehurst’s article \"Open source. Narrowing the Divide between Education, Business and Community\" \n\nABSTRACT. \n\nOpen source projects provide a unique opportunity for collaborative partners to collectively advance the technology and community for the benefit of all participants. Such collaborations give institutions with similar goals a way to combine design, development, funding and support efforts into a common solution that is more robust than a solution any single institution can create or maintain on its own. Certainly multi-institutional collaboration may face challenges and tradeoffs, especially during the start up phase; as the Hydra Project motto suggests, \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" This panel will explore the effective (and less than effective) pathways to a fruitful collaboration based on the panelists’ various project experience. The discussion will explore the following questions. \n\n• What are the benefits of open source collaboration? \n\n• What are the costs of collaboration? \n\n• What do you really have to do to make it work? are the responsibilities of collaborative partners? \n\n• How do you find (the right) collaborative partners? \n\n• What types of technical structures enable effective co-development? \n\n• What types of group structure are optimal/necessary? \n\n• What are some common pitfalls of a collaboration? \n\n• What are some of the key goals/agreements/behaviors/etc. to strive for? \n\n• What are some of the key goals/agreements/behaviors/etc. to avoid? \n\n• Why have your collaborations have gone well, or at times not so well? \n\n• What common legal or policy framework for software contributions, licensing and distribution do you have and how were those agreements reached? \n\n• What was the process for the formal project agreement and negotiations between institutions? \n\nPANELIST BIOGRAPHIES. \n\nTom Cramer \n\nChief Technology Strategist & Associate Director of Digital Library Systems and Services, Stanford University Libraries \n\nTom is one of the founding members of the Hydra Project (http.//projecthydra.org), the first adopter of Blacklight (http.//projectblacklight.org) outside of Virginia, and one of the social architects behind the International Image Interoperability Framework and the Digital Manuscripts Interoperability projects. He’s convinced that collaborative, open source efforts are the best (and only) way to develop and sustain solutions that meet the needs of researchers that are too big for a single institution to chew, and too esoteric for industry to address profitably. \n\nJon W. Dunn \n\nDirector of Library Technologies and Digital Libraries, Indiana University Libraries \n\nJon Dunn is co-Director of the Variations on Video project (http.//variationsonvideo.org/), a partnership between Indiana University and Northwestern University that is developing an open source software system to enable academic libraries and archives to easily provide online access to audio and video collections, supported in part by the US Institute of Museum and Library Services. He has a wide variety of experience in collaborative projects in the digital library space, including co-leading the Sakaibrary project, a joint effort of Indiana University and the University of Michigan Library to develop integration between library services and course management systems, and participating in the Digital Library Federation’s Aquifer project to build a federated digital library of content related to American social history. \n\nValorie Hollister \n\nDirector of Community Programs, DuraSpace \n\nVal leads the overall community strategy for the organization ensuring that the priorities, projects and development efforts are targeting the greatest need in the community. Val also develops and implements the framework to facilitate community collaboration and networking for both the DSpace and Fedora Commons projects. Her efforts include facilitating various community groups (Solution Communities, DSpace Ambassadors, DSpace Community Advisory Team), working to build consensus on each group's roles and priorities as well as pushing forward on specific projects. \n\nREFERENCES. \n\n\"Open source.

  "Abstract": "The German project Open Access Statistics (OAS) aims to increase the acceptance of Open Access among authors and users of scholarly publications by gathering internationally comparable usage statistics, and by providing a lasting infrastructure for the collection and processing of usage data. \n\nUsage statistics reflect the level of interest in accessing the content of an individual article and thereby enable item-level, usage-based assessment. Moreover, recommendation services and relevance criteria can be developed on the basis of usage patterns. \n\nIn order to enable the comparison of usage statistics internationally, irrespective of publication platform, resource type, country of origin, language, and thematic area, OAS and its national and international partners have agreed on uniform standards for the collection, exchange, and analysis of usage data. For the purpose of long-term gathering and processing internationally comparable usage data and statistics from a wide variety of repositories, OAS has developed robust and lasting infrastructure components."

  "Abstract": "The scholarly record is the foundation of knowledge creation, generated and sustained over centuries by the research community. It is at risk of neglect and loss if not copied and preserved digitally. \n\nDigital technology has enabled unprecedented growth of knowledge in science and the humanities. But this knowledge is inherently vulnerable. Current preservation processes do not provide complete coverage of the scholarly record. Over time, reliance on common approaches, technologies and organizations creates risk of common points of failure in securing long-term preservation of the record. \n\nThe Digital Preservation Network (DPN) initiative proposes to develop a diverse ecosystem that can ensure the survival of scholarship in digital form for future generations. The system envisioned is scalable, sustainable, and complementary to existing collection and preservation efforts. The system builds on existing repository platforms already in production and at scale. It federates these repositories by creating an ecosystem that replicates all content deposited for preservation purposes. \n\nDPN will build upon the higher education community’s current investments to create sufficient diversity of preservation approaches to assure access to the digital scholarly record forever. At the time of writing twenty-six organizations* from the USA have agreed to participate in the start and planning of this initiative with the goal of creating an organization by the end of 2012 to guide this important work. \n\nThis presentation will give an overview of the DPN initiative and describe the work completed thus far, as well as future work defined by the participating members. Although current members of DPN are solely in the USA to date, the members are interested in establishing international partners, beyond the initial launch phase."

  "Abstract": "Under-resourced, undirected, and lacking a clear value proposition, thus Dorothea Salo's 'Innkeeper at the Roach Motel,' captured the predicament of many first-generation library-based institutional repositories (IR) in the U.S. The lessons of 'Innkeeper' have been hard-learned, and to properly address them requires investment, strategy, and service vision far beyond one that establishes the IR as a standalone service managed by a maverick manger, or a part of one. To fully realize the vision of the IR as the essential infrastructure (Lynch 2003) for the seat of scholarly communication services on campus and to overcome the early stumbles across the community, a more holistic approach to service provision is required. \n\nInstitutional digital repositories, because they offer both preservation and access, make fine partners for emergent library-publishing programs offering a suite of services. We offer a detailed case study of Columbia University’s digital repository, Academic Commons (http.//academiccommons.columbia.edu), showing how its placement within Columbia’s Center for Digital Research and Scholarship has helped us double in size within a single year, provided us with strong partner relationships that have furthered the discussion of Open Access on campus, and even helped the Center itself generate increased interest in its services, all while giving Columbia University Libraries’ subject librarians additional tools that they can deploy to better serve their departments."

The DX is a bundle of commodity Dell X86 hardware with the CAStor Object Storage Platform software from a company called Caringo. The primary features of interest for us were the system's built-in support for replication and a health processor which continuously validates the fixity and copies of all the objects in storage. It also has features of 'cloud storage' such as an HTTP-based interface, support for custom metadata headers, and the lack of a traditional filesystem. \n\nOur presentation will briefly describe our project, and it will then go into more details about our decision to deploy the DX storage platform and how we integrated the DX with Fedora by developing a customized Akubra storage plugin.

Nearly 40% of these are manufacturing organizations. Steelcase Inc., a global office furniture manufacturer headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, now joins this group of centenarian manufacturers. \n\nMajor celebrations and anniversaries are often driving forces for collecting oral histories and other related memorabilia. Oral history projects can be costly to undertake, and with limited anniversary budget, Steelcase did not want to ignore this opportunity. Being a global company, they are looking to collect oral histories from anyone around the world who has a Steelcase Story to tell. \n\nTwo years ago, as part of the preparation of organizing historic records for the anniversary needs, Steelcase invested in a private digital repository.

The system is called City Research Online (CRO). Contrary to the title, the system created is not \"totally integrated\" (in fact far from it!). However the author was able to draw upon experiences learned in his previous role as Repository Manager at LSE, as well as those from the broader repository community, to implement automation of processes and systems integration. These lessons were implemented in light of the fact that City was relatively late in setting up its repository, and benefited from lessons learnt by other institutions. The paper details the set-up at City; explains how decisions made on the set-up were informed by past lessons; and examines the level of integration judged by a number of different criteria."

  "Authors": ["Karen Cariani"],
  "Affiliations": ["WGBH Educational Foundation, United States of America"],
  "Abstract": "In the burgeoning field of digital humanities, media collections have an opportunity to become significantly more important as primary source research materials. Media presents an overwhelming challenge to under resourced cultural institutions that lack the funds to properly store, migrate, preserve, and provide access. Media, as digital files, are exponentially more migratable, preservable, and accessible if curators and archivists have the appropriate tools to manage and preserve these digital materials. \n\nVisual and audio documentation of our culture is increasingly born digital, and as analog recordings are digitized for preservation and access, cultural heritage institutions with media collections must become digital asset managers. Digital asset management (DAM) systems exist to manage access, repositories for preservation, and content management systems for web access. These systems are expensive and complicated to maintain, license, and develop. None fully accommodate digital media, and there is no one solution to preserve our digital heritage and facilitate the best opportunities for scholarly and public access. \n\nMany recent projects have enhanced the open landscape of media preservation and access tools. But many of these solutions are complicated and difficult to implement, particularly for small cultural heritage institutions, and public media stations. The American Archive inventory project has demonstrated that the many public media stations across the country have been keeping valuable cultural heritage materials. In addition, they continue to capture events and culture every day through their local productions. These new productions are being created in digital formats. These stations need a digital preservation and storage solution that is easy to implement. However no one is focusing on a media preservation system to manage large time-based files, particularly around verification and notification of where the assets are stored. \n\nThis project seeks to develop a digital preservation system for media files based on Hydra, utilizing a Fedora repository that can be easily implemented and hooked into storage systems for preservation. This stack is the best suited for handling large media files, with flexible data management, workflow modeling, and interface needs for public media organizations with few technical resources for implementation. We will also address the complicated workflows needed to capture for long-term storage the born digital media material created today, which will become our history tomorrow."

With each change to an eprint, the history displays the EPrints XML associated with the item as it was before and after the change, including the unchanged metadata. When an item has been intensively revised, the readability of the audit trail decreases and it becomes difficult to identify the core information. In order to address this issue, we propose a Summary View for each eprint. The Summary View presents the history of changes in a table that includes only the information about the relevant changed fields. We have implemented this method to display embargo history, and propose a discussion of the potential generalizability of this approach to all other eprint fields."

This paper will outline Hylandora; the four levels of interoperability between Hydra and Islandora; strategies and opportunities for convergence between the two projects; and areas where initial investigations indicate that it makes the most sense for the projects to continue to specialize. The discussion will conclude with design implications for Fedora, as the early Hylandora work has made clear that interoperability could be facilitated by pushing certain functionality into Fedora.

  "Abstract": "The preservation community has to adopt to what has been coined the data deluge (Hey & Trefethen, 2003). A logistic growth of available information as a consequence of the increasing size of single entities like images and the increase in the amount of content creators. The e-Science community for example has to employ new modes of data analysis in order to handle the amount of data resulting from modern experiments since the sheer volume of output data renders sequential processing impractical. Similarly in digital media archiving the requirements in regard to volume have increased proportional to the rate of growth of content published. Web archiving for example requires the ingestion of tens of thousands of files on a daily basis. This increase in volume poses new challenges for digital preservation in terms of performance and scalability. By implementing the Akubra API for the Hadoop file system, the processing power of distributed hardware infrastructures can be used to run preservation tasks in a parallel manner without exporting data beforehand via time consuming copy operations."

  "Abstract": "Repository communities in OpenAIRE. Experiences in building up an Open Access Infrastructure for European research \n\nNajla Rettberg, \n\nGöttingen State and University Library, University of Göttingen, Germany; \n\nDr. Birgit Schmidt, \n\nGöttingen State and University Library, University of Göttingen, Germany \n\n1. A European Research Infrastructure \n\nThe OpenAIRE initiative supports researchers in disseminating and providing the widest possible visibility of their research output . Now in its third year (2009 – 2012), the project has gained a wide insight into the issues and challenges involved in establishing an Open Access repository infrastructure to facilitate this process. OpenAIREplus , a sister project (2011 – 2014), is now embarking on its mission to support researchers access and deliver research data, and other associated information, via linking from Open Access publications. This paper will outline the range of activities the two initiatives are working on, and some of the challenges and issues involved in setting up an Open Access participatory infrastructure for scientific information. \n\n2. Linked up Open Access repositories \n\nOpenAIRE (Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe) is a 3-year European Commission (EC) funded initiative and has established a service based on the self-archiving of peer-reviewed articles, where authors deposit a copy of their peer-reviewed manuscript into an Open Access repository at the time of publication. The success of OpenAIRE is based on a two-tier approach whereby the data infrastructure is supported by both technological and networking activities. \n\nThe project has so far established a thriving European networking structure of National Open Access Desks (NOADs) in each partner country, who support European researchers at a local level with the publication deposit process within OpenAIRE. They work to promote the concept of openness and access to a wider range of materials produced by researchers. These actions at a national level serve to create communities of practice which can in turn build up this pan-European infrastructure. This involves advocating, training stakeholders, providing guidelines and disseminating information about the initiative and Open Access in general. \n\nThe technical team works to build the infrastructure supporting this collaborative Open Access environment, building functionalities for storage, deposition, mediation services for users to access the OpenAIRE information space – that is the realm of openly accessible publications and perspectively linked research data in the context of European research funding. More detailed information about these technical activities (with special reference to OpenAIREplus) can be found in a separate abstract submission for this conference \n\n3. Services for Users \n\nThe OpenAIRE portal offers a range of services to users. It provides free access to FP7 publications, offers depositing services, and various types of statistics which to some degree indicate the impact of the research funds. The portal team has created a set of tools to expose content as well as usage statistic services. In a new release of the portal, scheduled for later this year, repository managers will be able to receive processed usage statistics, per publication and per repository. A Helpdesk supports researchers with Open Access issues, such as self-archiving and copyright issues . It also supports data providers for joining the OpenAIRE infrastructure, and policy makers for implementing Open Access policies. A set of guidance documents for different identified stakeholders have also been produced, addressing authors, repository managers, research institutions and journals who wish to be compliant with the EC’s OA policies and the OpenAIRE system . \n\n4. The Challenges Faced \n\nSetting up a collaborative infrastructure based on local repositories doesn’t come without its challenges. Some of the issues the team is fine-tuning solutions to are. \n\n• Raising publication numbers. the project is undertaking a number of initiatives to increase content, and this paper will outline some of the steps taken to identify and collect FP7 publications, for example at project level, through to exploiting publisher content. \n\n• Highlighting incentives to researchers for depositing in Open Access. stressing factors such as increased citation figures and higher impact factors is something the project is following up. Making deposits as easy as possible is another area which is being developed, as well as bringing attention to researchers of existing mandates. \n\n• Raising awareness of the Open Access mandate among EC project coordinators. this is being tackled by creating guidance documents. Examining how EC officers can disseminate information on Open Access requirements, in addition to planning pertinent training sessions have also been identified as solutions. Creating a workflow for research administrators before and during projects will also help raise the profile of Open Access in research activities. \n\n• Repository repository compliancy with OpenAIRE. encouraging compliancy has been the focus of a number of efforts. The team has strived to make technical requirements as low-barrier as possible, encouraged the creation and use of plug-ins for popular platforms, and provided user friendly guides. Efforts such as ‘compliancy month’ have helped to raise compliancy numbers. \n\n5. Creating an Enriched Research Environment \n\nThe recently launched parallel project OpenAIREplus widens the network further to 41 participating partners and aims to bridge the gap between publications and associated data. This 30 month project will operate alongside OpenAIRE, and will focus on opening up the infrastructure to data sources from subject-specific communities to provide metadata about research data and publications, facilitating the linking between these objects. The ability to link within a publication out to a citable database, or other research data material, is fairly innovative and this project will enable users to search, browse, view, and create relationships between different information objects. \n\nSome of the challenges that the project might be working with are. \n\n• Identification of data repositories. an initial survey of the regional communities indicates that data initiatives vary in number and focus across regions. In some regions only a few institutional data repositories have been brought to our attention. OpenAIREplus would like to open up to content from reputable repositories. Identifying quality requirements and criteria is an initial challenge. \n\n• Data deposit. the culture of deposit varies enormously within disciplines, as seen from the discipline-specific studies OpenAIRE has carried out (mentioned below). The project is starting to think about incentives for researchers to deposit data, from either a funding requirement level, or from the perspective of giving clear, practical incentives as to how sound data management can bring recognition and raise impact to researchers’ scholarly output. \n\n• Promoting good data management. working on tools and guidance to assist researchers is one of the aims of OpenAIREplus. Actively embedding them into the daily workflow of researchers will be a potential theme and something that the networking team is starting to think of strategies to advocate. \n\n6. Enhanced Publications \n\nAs part of the its research activities, the project will explore how links between text-based publications and research data are managed in different scientific fields. This complements a previous study in OpenAIRE on current disciplinary practices and future needs for infrastructural Open Access services, taking into account the variety within research approaches . These studies will also feed into the liaison side of the infrastructure and incorporated into dissemination and training materials. On a technical level the infrastructure will develop services to manage these enriched publications. publications linking to associated information such as datasets, licenses, funding and project information. Ultimately, portal services will be supported that will allow the user to manage these enhanced publications. \n\n7. Sustaining the Service \n\nA study on addressing sustainability issues and financing models for the collection and dissemination of OA publications and data, with specific reference to OpenAIRE will also be produced. The results of these studies will be customised and incorporated into advocacy materials disseminated by the networking team. \n\nAnother service area is the expansion of the OpenAIRE Helpdesk to promote the continuum of publications and data sets in the minds of European researchers, repository and research managers. The OpenAIRE guidelines will be updated and best practice for research data will be identified. \n\nThe paper will also touch on the other areas tackled in the project with regard to the culture of sharing data. A study on the ‘Licensing of publications and research data’ will investigate the legal requirements for different kinds of usage of research data in an Open Access infrastructure. \n\nAcknowledgments.

Many students have identified Twitter and other social media channels as useful sources of data for their initial investigations, but lack either the technical knowledge or the time to create their own software to download and store data from the services’ respective APIs. \n\nThis paper describes our attempt to adapt a repository to capture real-time data from a popular social media service (Twitter) in order to facilitate student projects. We describe the implementation of two designs for Tweet ingest, both of which are shown to be flawed with respect to the scale of the data capture problem. The wider aim of this work is (a) to improve the ingest and curation of streams of rich media items (not limited to Twitter) and (b) to embed the repository at the very start of the research process and workflow, improving the relationship between the researcher and the repository by increasing the value of the repository as a research enabler."

Additionally, the data itself is more important than the code that handles it, and therefore the code changes far more frequently than the data. This highlights the necessity for reusable software that focuses on data transformations.Stemming from this observation, the hereby presented open source framework and toolkit aims at facilitating the often appearing transformation tasks. The source data can be in the form of records in a legacy database, conforming to deprecated formats, or simply satisfying internal ad hoc needs. The framework has been used in numerous real-life use cases, some of which are presented in the article. Contributions from the open source community are welcome and are greatly facilitated by the framework's modular and extensible nature."

  "Abstract": "Native content deposit interfaces of popular repository softwares such as DSpace and EPrints have changed little since their introduction over a decade ago. The more recent emergence of SWORD, a means of abstracting the deposit interface from the underlying repository software, provides opportunities for experimenting with new deposit methods. The Developer Challenge event at recent Open Repositories conferences has provided award-winning examples. The JISC DepositMO Project has developed two new repository deposit interfaces, in the process both contributing to and using the new SWORDv2 protocol. These interfaces aimed to reposition deposit in the context of popular authoring and desktop management tools, also to reschedule repository deposit from end-of-creation to an in-progress activity, thereby seeking to change the culture, or modus operandi (the ‘MO’ of DepositMO), of repository deposit. These interfaces have been extensively tested with users. This paper illustrates use of these interfaces and summarises the test results. We discovered it is possible to demonstrate an initial wow! factor for repository deposit, but this is harder to sustain in practice. Briefly, we describe a short follow-on proposal, which aims to adapt and apply these tools to demonstrate increased rates of deposit of repository content."

It examines the development of a ‘party infrastructure’ by the National Library of Australia (NLA) through dedicated project funding from the Australian National Data Service (ANDS). \n\nModelled on distributed authority control, the party infrastructure aggregates public data about ‘parties’ (people and organisations) from participating Australian repositories and metadata store solutions and issues public, unique, resolvable and persistent identifiers. These identifiers and their associated information are accessible through the National Library’s Trove service, ANDS’ Research Data Australia service, and through machine-to-machine interfaces that allow participating institutions to pull the identifiers back into their local systems. More than just another identifier, the party infrastructure works as an identity resolution service where records from different repository sources for the same party are grouped under a single party identifier issued by the National Library of Australia. \n\nA number of difficult challenges were faced and the lessons learned in developing the infrastructure including. workflow models; data requirements; privacy concerns; automatic matching rules and rates; machine-to-machine interfaces; staffing requirements; institutional barriers; and relationship to other author identification initiatives such as the global Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) initiative."

  "Abstract": "Every year the UK Higher Education community downloads large volumes of geospatial data from EDINA's geospatial data delivery services. Researchers and students are deriving new geospatial datasets from this source data. In recognition of the value these new derived datasets can play to the academic community, EDINA has set up ShareGeo as a repository to encourage the sharing and reuse of derived geospatial data. DSpace has been customised to offer a repository that eases both the deposit and discovery of geospatial data. ShareGeo interoperates with other components of the UK academic spatial data infrastructure by exposing it's metadata for harvesting by GoGeo, the national academic geospatial metadata discovery service. ShareGeo is a DSpace repository for geospatial data sharing. \n\nTo meet the needs of those in academia working with geospatial data, DSpace has been customised to offer an enhanced map-based search whereby those searching for geospatial data can use geography in combination with standard keyword searching to identify datasets of interest. The deposit process has also been customised to enable automatic extraction of geo-specific metadata. The DSpace OAI metadata harvesting interface has been enabled to ensure harvesting of content by the UK academic geoportal increases the discoverability of data deposited into ShareGeo. Other customisations include a SWORD-based plugin to offer data deposit directly into ShareGeo from the most commonly used Geographical Information System (GIS) software found in UK academia."

The main changes were. the addition of specific qualifiers to the Metadata Dublin Core scheme, the modification of the submission form, the integration of the MeSH Thesaurus as controlled vocabulary and the optimization of the advanced search tool. Another key point during the setting up of the repository was the initial batch ingest of the documents."

Edinburgh DataShare is a multi-disciplinary institutional data repository, based on DSpace, set up by the Data Library to allow Edinburgh University researchers to deposit, share, and license their data resources for online discovery and use by others, either openly or in a controlled way if requested. \n\nOn Figshare researchers can publish figures, datasets, tables, videos, anything. All file formats can be published, including videos and datasets that are often demoted to the supplemental materials section in current journals. Up to 1GB of data can be stored privately for free, and users have unlimited space for publicly available research. All data is stored under CC license to encourage frictionless sharing. \n\nEdinburgh DataShare has been customised to offer its own look and feel, with a selection of standards-compliant metadata fields useful for discovery of datasets, through Google and other search engines. A persistent identifier and suggested citation are provided and all data is stored under ODC, PDDL licenses, or unlicensed with a valid rights statement to encourage sharing and re-use. \n\nBoth of these platforms offer a lot to researchers but rather than working in relative isolation, can the platforms trade socio-technical solutions to encourage best practice and researcher engagement in the process of making publicly funded research outputs available for re-use? Where can these projects collaborate in order to aid the research community? What are the technical and ‘political’ problems associated with such collaborations?"

This project builds on recent EPrints for publications developments at the University, while drawing on in-house research data management expertise at the UK Data Archive. The project commenced with a requirements gathering exercise based around extensive interviews and data inventories of a number of departments and research groups within the University selected for the diversity of their data types. The technical strand aims to customise EPrints to meet these requirements while also trialling the use of protocol-based deposit for users and data citation functionality. Sample data will be gathered from many of the consulted research groups followed by ingest of this sample data into our test-bed repository. We will report on the initial stages of the project and present challenges faced and solutions proposed."

  "Abstract": "Big Data is already here, and it’s not always what we think. What is the biggest insight that we have learned in fifteen years of building and stewarding digital collections? That we can never guess every way that our collections will be used. More and more researchers want to use collections as a whole, mining and organizing the information in novel ways. Researchers increasingly use algorithms to mine the rich information and tools to create pictures that translate that information into knowledge. Datasets are not just scientific and business tables and spreadsheets. our collections are now considered data. This paper presents four case studies from the Library of Congress around large data collections and developing tools that can operate at a layer on top of repository collections to support research activities."

  "Abstract": "Web applications frequently leverage copies of resources made available by remote web servers, repositories or databases. As resources are created, modified, deleted, or moved, these applications face the challenge of remaining synchronized with the source server. Several approaches exist to help meet this challenge in cases where 'good enough' synchronization is acceptable, or within homogeneous environments. However, no commonly accepted Web-based solutions exist where precise resource coverage or low synchronization latency are required. \n\nMotivated by the need to synchronize resources for applications in the realms of cultural heritage and research communication, the National Information Standardization Organization and the Open Archives Initiative have recently launched the ResourceSync project that aims to design an approach for resource synchronization that is aligned with current web architecture and meets the needs of different communities. \n\nI will discuss some motivating use cases and provide a perspective on the resource synchronization problem from initial discussions. I will also describe two experiments which probe different aspects of the problem space. 1) synchronization of a rapidly evolving linked data collection (http.//live.dbpedia.org/) based on a server pushing notifications out when its resources change, and 2) synchronization of repository content such as arXiv (http.//arxiv.org/) to support both a mirror network and externally operated services.

  "Key": "BeyondBibliographicMetadataAugmentingtheHKUIR",
  "Authors": ["David Palmer"],
  "Affiliations": ["The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong S.A.R. (China)"],
  "Abstract": "The HKU Scholars Hub (The Hub) is the institutional repository of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), which from 2005 has placed items in open access. However in 2009, a new university initiative appeared, Knowledge Exchange, which recognizes the 3rd mission of universities, to engage with their communities, for bilateral benefit. In this regard The Hub received funding from the HKU Office of Knowledge Exchange, to make HKU research and researchers highly visible, in the expectation that this will greatly increase opportunities for contract and collaborative research, the creation of cross-institutional multidisciplinary teams for e-research, etc. \n\nTo answer this need, The Hub hosted in DSpace, needed to quickly augment existing bibliographic metadata, add metadata on other objects, such as people, grants, patents, etc., and augment this metadata as well. \n\nBibliographic Metadata. We receive a data feed of publication metadata from the HKU Research Output System (ROS) database, managed by the HKU Registry. This metadata is usually dirty and thin. To ameliorate we created several procedures. 1) A web service on ROS, to receive a DOI or ISBN, and then auto-populate the record with data from CrossRef or OCLC, without any other input from the user. Our next planned step, is to refuse entry into ROS, without a DOI or ISBN in most cases. 2) Thin metadata from ROS, and even data from CrossRef or OCLC, can be augmented, or further cleansed, to add more value, and of course more access points for search engine optimization. We have had an on-going project for several years to clean HKU metadata in Scopus. Therefore the Scopus AU-IDs for HKU people are \"mostly\" correct. We now use the Scopus API, matching on corresponding AU-IDs, to bring back publisher supplied metadata on HKU publications. After giving HKU authors one last time to deny ownership to this metadata, we overlay our existing thin and dirty metadata with full and correct metadata. 3) To show publication metadata authored previous to authors’ HKU tenure, we retrieve RIS or XML data from Scopus, or from author supplied EndNote files. 4) With correct DOI, we can bring in on-the-fly, corresponding citation counts from Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed Central, etc. \n\nAuthor Metadata. We created ResearcherPages for each of the approximately 1,400 scholars, eligible to apply for grant funding. These pages show their publication lists linked to fulltext, or remotely subscribed fulltext. However, we soon found that some disciplines do not value publications as indications of scholarly worth. For these we added other types of metadata, such as Awards, which greatly pleased the Faculty of Architecture, and those receiving teaching awards. Other facets that we added were, HKU Committees, Supervision of Graduate Students, Grants, Bibliometrics, etc. \n\nThesis Metadata. HKU has three separate, and separately controlled silos for thesis metadata and fulltext objects, each with issues of dirty or thin metadata. a) Graduate School, b) Student Information Service (Registry), and c) library catalogue records. The first two of these are dark databases, allowing no public access. We have had to create processes to update each silo with supplementary data from the others. For The Hub, this means that we can now show for each supervisor, complete lists of supervised students, with a correct thesis title hyperlinked to the fulltext thesis, also in The Hub. At the other end of the hyperlink, the record for a thesis will now show a link to a supervisor. We have become a publisher in CrossRef, and are issuing DOI numbers to each HKU thesis. This will make them more visible, and eventually allow us to show citation counts beside each thesis. \n\nGrant Metadata. We import this metadata from a dark database controlled by the Registry. It is now publicly accessible in the Hub showing hyperlinks to the ResearcherPages of PI and Co-I, as well as to grants of similar sponsor, panel, etc. Recently we found ways to hyperlink from the Grant record, to a publication resulting from that grant. \n\nPatent Metadata. We receive metadata from the HKU Technology Transfer Office, which is limited and focused upon patents in the US. We have built VBnet scripts to use the patent publication or issued number, search on the patent offices of the US, China, EU, Japan and others to bring back complete metadata, which includes priority dates, patent numbers of application, continuation, and of corresponding patents by the same HKU inventors in other jurisdictions, aka., \"patent family\". We then use these newly received numbers to retrieve metadata for their complete records and display in The Hub. In the end, we have patent records that show a complete history from application to issuance and hyperlinkage to patents in the same family. \n\nAll of this increased metadata, which is augmented, and becoming cleaner, has increased the utility of the Hub, and enabled content re-use. 1) We can now show hyperlinked visualizations of networked people, based upon co-authorship, co-investigatorship, same committee, same keyword in publication, patent, research interest, etc. 2) We provide a web service for the HKU departments to extract from The Hub metadata and build author profiles in their departmental pages. 3) Some HKU offices, realizing that we can present better data and attract more eyes, have asked us to take-over services that they once provided. 4) We can send files of augmented and clean metadata back to our original data providers, thus allowing their records to benefit from our work. 5) We use Thomson Reuter provided API to auto-create and auto-populate the TR ResearcherID for each of our 1,400 authors. \n\nEach Hub record on people, publication, grant, and patent will show download and view counts. These internal measures, anecdotes, and external measures, such as the Webometrics \"Ranking Web of World Repositories\" indicate that we have succeeded in making visible the research and researchers of HKU."

  "Abstract": "Research data and its associated metadata are no longer considered as simply research by-products; it is now used by researchers to validate, reproduce, and extend research. This has led to a growing importance for research institutions to make available Research Data Management (RDM) platforms which. automate data capture, support further curation, enable collected data to be organised, support licensing for re-use, facilitate access and discovery, enable long term preservation, facilitate publication, simplify data re-use, and enable citation. \n\nThese platforms must fit in with researchers’ tools, workflows, instrumentation, methodologies and their environment. As each of these are likely to vary from discipline to discipline, it is unrealistic to believe that a singular approach by a research institution to RDM will consistently meet researchers’ needs. Indeed, research institutions should expect to accommodate a range of RDM platforms for their researchers. \n\nOver the past 6 years, Monash University has had a wealth of experience in research data management, through. leadership of national RDM projects, determining RDM solutions for various research disciplines; and developing and deploying innovative research capabilities within the university. \n\nThis paper, informed by these experiences, provides some useful guidance in the selection, development, deployment, and engagement of institutional infrastructure for research data management."

Digital images are a container for much of the information content on the Web. images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, and even digitized archival materials. Yet much of the Internet’s scholarly image-base is locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally-built Web applications that sit atop distributed repositories of content. For the past two years, Stanford University has led two international collaborations with the objective of unlocking access to image-based research assets to a marketplace of service and tool developers, and through them a global network of scholars. By supporting the co-evolution of tools for image access with common repository API’s, each project is extending the reach of repositories to global audiences, empowered to use best-of-breed tools and content from any participating repository to fuel their research."

  "Abstract": "The Digital Humanities has long been an active area of development, and is typified by varied and creative approaches to presenting collections and scholarly discourse in the humanities. Projects are often \"one-offs\" from a technology perspective, that reflect a single scholar’s (or group of scholars) vision for a specific area of humanities research. They can also be large digitization projects designed to present a corpus of work to the larger community of scholars and the public, with little attention paid to special software, interfaces or textual analysis features. Taken as a whole these systems and collections provide a rich landscape for digital humanities research, and one that is getting richer. This session will highlight this effort via a panel of collaborators working towards similar goals using a collaborative approach to building platform-agnostic software that also integrates into a single framework for scholarship in the Digital Humanities. Panel participants will include representatives from the EMiC Project, Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) project, the TEI Archival Publishing and Access Service (TAPAS) Project, initiatives at the New York Public Library, and the Islandora software project."

  "Abstract": "OERPub is a new API for publishing OER (Open Education Resources) that was adapted lightly from SWORD V2. The purpose for the OERPub API is to enable an ecosystem of tools and services that support transforming, remixing, adapting, and translating OER. Repositories that support semantic formats (which make the content remixable), however, are hard to grow and maintain, because they need specialized tools for creating and editing content in those formats. Repositories aren't well-suited to try and build all the infrastructure that authors and consumers of the content need. Thus the need for simple and clear API's that empower the wider community to provide those tools and services. In this talk we will cover the additional features that were added to SWORD to specialize it for OER, the experience implementing the OERPub/SWORD API in Connexions (an open repository), and the experience creating a client that transforms content in general purposes formats like Word, Open Office, HTML, and Google Docs into semantic formats and then uses the API to publish the resulting content."

  "Authors": ["Todd Grappone", "Sharon Farb"],
  "Affiliations": ["UCLA, United States of America"],
  "Abstract": "In a world of rapidly changing technologies supporting multi-modal communication, (international satellite TV, the proliferation of Internet news outlets, Twitter and YouTube), the news industry is transforming. In parallel, \"citizen journalism\" is on the rise, enabled by smart phones, social networks, and blogs. The Internet is becoming a vast information ecosystem driven by mediated events – elections, social movements, natural disasters, disease epidemics – with rich, heterogeneous data. text, image, and video. Meanwhile, the tools and methodologies for users and researchers are not keeping pace. it remains prohibitively labor-intensive to systematically access and study the vast amount of emerging textual and audiovisual news data. In addition, intellectual property regimes currently complicate systematic and user-driven access, use, reuse, remixing, and preservation of the building blocks of news regardless of format, making sharing, using, and preserving the cultural and historical record unachievable. The UCLA Broadcast News Archive seeks to radically transform the traditional library and academic paradigms when it comes to collecting, teaching, and doing research with the news, as well as intellectual property regarding this effort. \n\nThis presentation will highlight the vast potential to discover, share, analyze, use, and reuse both traditional broadcast news sources and those that are newly emerging, which are in some cases contested as hard news. It will feature a discussion of the variety of multimedia content and complex layering of news sources, raising questions of intellectual property, privacy, aggregation, authority, and authenticity as well as the notion of news sources and openness as a fundamental building block of a diverse and informed public. We will provide an overview of the digital archive and the process and approach the UCLA Library and its partners have taken to develop the broadest possible access, use, and reuse of the collection, which will soon be made available to the research community through an interactive news interface and demonstrate how news visuals can be analyzed in conjunction with news texts. As with any multimedia and contemporary collection of rich media, intellectual property and other rights and policy issues are complex and embedded in all aspects of providing broad public access, use, and preservation of the collection. We will share the approach we have taken to maximize the public-good aspect and to make the collection as widely available as possible. We will also discuss an exciting new venture for the archive, a Text and Image Parsing Project, which aims to categorize news by topics and events, analyze selection and presentation biases across networks and media spheres in a statistical and quantitative manner, conduct an experimental investigation of the cognitive consequences of concordant and discordant audio/visual information streams, and model techniques of verbal and visual persuasion. \n\nBackground on the archive. The Communication Studies Archive at UCLA is a cross-disciplinary NSF- and self-funded effort to digitize, analyze, and make available an unprecedented news resource for researchers worldwide. Leveraging the UCLA Library’s growing digital collection of 150,000 hours of television news videos, including 9.7 billion image frames and 730 million words in various languages of closed-captioning news text directed by the UCLA Department of Communication Studies and curated by the UCLA Library, the archive offers a new paradigm for hosting, presenting, analyzing, and preserving audiovisual datasets of social and political news events. More broadly, this dynamic and fast-growing collection and collaboration seeks to establish a scholarly and community record and aggregated resource that can be used by students, faculty, researchers, and citizens worldwide to inform themselves and analyze news, including but not limited to discovery and revealing of spatio-temporal patterns in the interactions of multiple mediated events, themes, trends, historical patterns, omissions, etc. Through an interactive news interface, researchers will have the ability to visualize and interact with computation and statistical results."

  "Abstract": "‘Big Science’ - that is, facilities science with large data volumes and multi-national investments – has data-management problems which are qualitatively different from other disciplines. These differences arise in part from the quantities of data, of course, but possibly more importantly from the cultural, organisational and technical distinctiveness of these academic cultures. \n\nThese differences are such that ‘just read the OAIS spec’ is reasonable Data Management and Preservation (DMP) advice, but this bald prescription can be usefully supported by guidance on OAIS validation, audit and cost modelling. The MaRDI-Gross project was funded by JISC in 2011–12 to produce such guidance, and we will report here on what we have produced, and reflect on the nature of the ‘big-science’ data management culture."

Currently StudentWeb only retains internal information about the lifecycle of the student’s master’s thesis - information which is unavailable to the individual norwegian institutions for archiving purposes. \n\nThis project has used the new SWORDv2 [4] protocol and the DSpace implementation in 1.8.2 to define a submission process between StudentWeb and DSpace which allows for theses to be created, updated and deleted by students - as well as graded and embargoed by lecturers - with seamless deposit into the repository of these changing states. This paper will explore the protocol operations we used from SWORDv2, describe the modifications, plugins and configuration that were necessary in DSpace to achieve the integration, and discuss the overall long-term goals of the project and the approach taken to this large-scale SWORDv2 integration project. \n\n[1] http.//www.uio.no/ \n\n[2] http.//cottagelabs.com/ \n\n[3] https.//studweb.uio.no/as/WebObjects/studentweb2?inst=UiO \n\n[4] http.//swordapp.org/"

  "Abstract": "The present proposal is for a tutorial session in order to inform repository managers and administrators about the compliancy process with the OpenAIRE guidelines. \n\nThe tutorial is directed to repository managers. - Interested in learning more about making their DSpace repository compliant with the OpenAIRE infrastructure to support and monitor the implementation of the FP7 Open Access pilot; - Wanting to help their faculty complying with the Open Access requirements of the European Commission (EC)? - Wanting to add EC project data to their repository records and use OpenAIRE value-added functionality (post authoring tools, monitoring tools through analysis of document and usage statistics)? \n\nIn order to harvest and connect publications to related EC FP7 grant agreement, the OpenAIRE infrastructure requires repositories to adopt the OpenAIRE Guidelines. These are low-barrier requirements for OAI-PMH compliant repositories that build on the oai_dc and DRIVER Guidelines. \n\nWhen the repository is OpenAIRE compliant, its FP7 funded content is harvested periodically, indexed within the OpenAIRE portal and presented in the OpenAIRE search and browse section. In this way, FP7 funded research results deposited in the repository can achieve wider visibility and distribution – and be read, used and cited more widely by the global research community. \n\nResearch managers in institution will be able to compare the institutional performance in FP7 projects with the performance of other institutions in their countries and within the European Union using the OpenAIRE FP7 publication statistics tool. This compliance will also save time for researchers. \n\nRepositories, successfully harvested by the OpenAIRE, are entitled to display the OpenAIRE logo on their website, to certify quality and the global networked status of their content. \n\nThe OpenAIRE project team can help repository managers with targeted advocacy activities to ensure that high quality content is deposited into the repositories and then harvested by the OpenAIRE portal. The OpenAIRE project team reach out to the researchers publishing FP7 funded articles and encourage them to self-archive in repositories. \n\nAgenda. \n\n• OpenAIRE and compliancy with the ERC Scientific Council Guidelines for Open Access and the European Commission Open Access Pilot in FP7. \n\n• How to make the repository OpenAIRE compliant.

In order for software implementations to be successful, user institutions and organizations must be provided the ability to personalize their implementations to highlight their individual strengths, and this means customization. However, with software as large and complex as DSpace can be, and with the great diversity of technical proficiency of the user base, the priority of accessible customization becomes increasingly influential as the community grows. Currently, customization can be a significant hurdle for uninitiated users seeking to personalize DSpace for their institution or organization. This presentation will seek to demystify interface customizations through discussing development tools, the architecture of the most popular interface, troubleshooting best practices, and a combination of these with regard to specific popular topics."

  "Abstract": "The problem facing many DSpace Repository Managers is the complex task of matching content policies with complex business rules. The authorisation and access within the DSpace software is challenging for most Repository Managers, and it dictates that policy is uniform across collections, in reality our collections are a mixture of items and we need flexibility to change and amend policies. We have solved many problems using authentication systems to create access to matching collections but we struggle at the application end matching the access to the system capabilities. There are some things that cannot be solved with authentication. \n\nThese policies can range from. \n\n1. Freely available online \n\n2. Available to campus users only \n\n3. Available to administrators or discrete groups \n\n4. A mixture within an item of some parts being available and others restricted. \n\n5. A mixture of different access for metadata and the associated bitstreams. (some files open and some restricted) \n\nA series of DSpace curation tasks were created to meet the user requirements. Use cases are described and discussed. \n\n1. Digital Theses. ResearchSpace@auckland.ac.nz – managing institutional deposit policies determined by University Statutes \n\n2. Data Curation – satisfying the requirements for data elements ranging from open datasets, to derived data components. \n\n3. Publications and Creative Works – mixed access policies \n\n4. Image collections \n\nSolution \n\nA series of three curation tasks were created and added to processing workflow. dc.rights.accessrights field is used to indicate overall access level of each ResearchSpace item. Three values used in the field are. \"http.//purl.org/eprint/accessRights/RestrictedAccess\", \"http.//purl.org/eprint/accessRights/ClosedAccess\", and \"http.//purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess\". \n\nWhat is a Curation Task? \n\nA Curation Task is a workflow step in the DSpace software that does not involve making changes to the core DSpace code base, it enables software developers to take a business rule and craft this to work in addition to and on top of the application functionality. It further expands the concept of repository as a service where Repository Managers and administrative staff can design their requirements with maximum flexibility. If the policy changes the curation task can be updated and applied to items, collections or parts of items."

  "Abstract": "The scholarly record is the foundation of knowledge creation, generated and sustained over centuries by the research community. It is at risk of neglect and loss if not copied and preserved digitally. \n\nDigital technology has enabled unprecedented growth of knowledge in science and the humanities. But this knowledge is inherently vulnerable. Current preservation processes do not provide complete coverage of the scholarly record. Over time, reliance on common approaches, technologies and organizations creates risk of common points of failure in securing long-term preservation of the record. \n\nThe Digital Preservation Network (DPN) initiative proposes to develop a diverse ecosystem that can ensure the survival of scholarship in digital form for future generations. The system envisioned is scalable, sustainable, and complementary to existing collection and preservation efforts. The system builds on existing repository platforms already in production and at scale. It federates these repositories by creating an ecosystem that replicates all content deposited for preservation purposes. \n\nDPN will build upon the higher education community’s current investments to create sufficient diversity of preservation approaches to assure access to the digital scholarly record forever. At the time of writing twenty-six organizations* from the USA have agreed to participate in the start and planning of this initiative with the goal of creating an organization by the end of 2012 to guide this important work. \n\nThis presentation will give an overview of the DPN initiative and describe the work completed thus far, as well as future work defined by the participating members. Although current members of DPN are solely in the USA to date, the members are interested in establishing international partners, beyond the initial launch phase."

  "Abstract": "Under-resourced, undirected, and lacking a clear value proposition, thus Dorothea Salo's 'Innkeeper at the Roach Motel,' captured the predicament of many first-generation library-based institutional repositories (IR) in the U.S. The lessons of 'Innkeeper' have been hard-learned, and to properly address them requires investment, strategy, and service vision far beyond one that establishes the IR as a standalone service managed by a maverick manger, or a part of one. To fully realize the vision of the IR as the essential infrastructure (Lynch 2003) for the seat of scholarly communication services on campus and to overcome the early stumbles across the community, a more holistic approach to service provision is required. \n\nInstitutional digital repositories, because they offer both preservation and access, make fine partners for emergent library-publishing programs offering a suite of services. We offer a detailed case study of Columbia University’s digital repository, Academic Commons (http.//academiccommons.columbia.edu), showing how its placement within Columbia’s Center for Digital Research and Scholarship has helped us double in size within a single year, provided us with strong partner relationships that have furthered the discussion of Open Access on campus, and even helped the Center itself generate increased interest in its services, all while giving Columbia University Libraries’ subject librarians additional tools that they can deploy to better serve their departments."

  "Abstract": "The Demonstration Test Catchment (DTC) project, set up by DEFRA (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, part of the UK Government) is carrying out a long-term investigation of water catchment areas in the UK. The project aims to devise innovative solutions to the long-standing water quality problem of diffuse pollution, i.e. the release of pollutants that individually may have minimal environmental effect, but which on the catchment scale can have a significant impact on water quality and wildlife – examples include run-off from roads and commercial areas, discharges of fertilisers and waste from farmland, and seepage into groundwater from developed landscapes of all kinds. The project will carry out detailed monitoring of environmental parameters in order better to understand the origin and nature of the stressors that cause such pollution. This is a key issue in enabling the UK to comply with the Water Framework Directive, a European Union directive on water quality, so the project has impact way beyond the academic and research sectors. \n\nA key component of the project is the DTC Archive project, undertaken by the UK Freshwater Biological Association and the Centre for e-Research at King’s College London. This is responsible for curating the data generated and captured by catchment areas and providing appropriate services allowing it to be reused by a variety of different stakeholders, including scientific researchers, but also decision and policy makers in government and non-governmental bodies, building planners and developers, as well as people (such as farmers and other landowners) who live and work in the catchment areas. \n\nA major challenge is the diversity and complexity of data, including hydrological information, water chemistry data, biodiversity and ecological data, and weather records, ecological data, much of which is input from sensors. In addition, there is a great deal of \"soft data\" such as surveys, interviews, subjective assessments, photographic and video images. Not only is the data diverse, but there are also diverse standards as regards the metadata and terminology used to describe the data and its component parts. This diversity must be dealt with if it is to be possible to interrogate and otherwise interact with this very diverse material as a virtually integrated whole, and in ways that support the needs of very different types of user. \n\nThe approach taken is one of using semantic integration to support a range of different visualisations, querying and data analysis workflows. The project is developing formal vocabularies to describe the data and domain-specific objects, procedures and relationships, defining SKOS models for implementing these following a linked data approach. We are, as far as is practicable, using existing vocabularies to describe domain-specific objects, procedures and relationships, to enable the archive to interoperate and exchange data with other systems, although additional vocabulary development is being undertaken. While the archive will preserve – and provide access to – the individual datasets, these will also be mapped onto this common RDF-based model, to allow cross-dataset semantic querying and visualisation based on SPARQL and other standards."

  "Abstract": "Abstract \n\nDataStaR, a semantic web application, is intended to serve as a metadata registry to promote the discovery of research data sets by making basic metadata available as linked open data. The application will support the description of research data, linking to data sets in any location, and the publication of data sets to selected repositories supporting the SWORD (Simple Web-service Offering Repository Deposit) protocol. DataStaR will help make research data services, and the research data itself, more visible in the local institutional landscape as well as enable that information to be linked or aggregated for indexing and discovery functions across multiple institutions or by domain of interest. \n\nToward this effort, Cornell University’s Albert R. Mann Library and Washington University in St Louis are partnering to identify researchers’ needs and preferences to share and discover datasets and enhancing the DataStaR semantic platform for this use. Two activities are currently underway. 1) Librarians at each institution have interviewed researchers using the Data Curation Profile toolkit to elucidate needs for data sharing and discovery; 2) As part of this investigation, a development team is transitioning the semantic platform (DataStaR) from a single-library software prototype to a documented, open-source platform ready for adoption and extension at other institutions wishing to provide research data sharing and discovery services. For this conference, we will present the results of the interviews, DataStaR as it is currently implemented, and future development plans. \n\nBackground \n\nThe promise and challenge of sharing, re-using, and preserving research data are receiving a great deal of attention (Westra, Ramirez, Parham, & Scaramozzino, 2010). Data sharing has the potential to facilitate new ways of conducting research and assist new discoveries, and research institutions need to consider how they will support their researchers in complying with the new or strengthened requirements for data sharing from funders. However, significant challenges exist in providing this support primarily because the infrastructure for services and best practices for research data curation and discovery are still in development. \n\nCornell University Library began addressing the specific challenges of data management needs of faculty and researchers in 2007 through the development of DataStaR. DataStaR was originally designed and tested as a local data staging repository to facilitate the documentation and transmission of research data sets from a variety of disciplines to domain-specific repositories and/or institutional repositories (Dietrich, 2010; Khan, et.al., 2010; Lowe, 2009; Steinhart, 2010; Steinhart, Dietrich, & Green, 2009). \n\nCurrent Endeavors \n\nWe are identifying researchers’ needs and preferences to share and discover datasets and enhancing the DataStaR semantic platform for research data discovery. \n\nIdentifying Researchers’ Needs \n\nConsiderable effort is being directed at understanding the needs of researchers with respect to data curation , as well as information management in general (Kroll & Forsman, 2010). A library service model designed to support researchers in making their data more visible and reusable must be developed in the context of researchers’ own practices and priorities, and be applicable throughout the research process. \n\nTo better understand these needs, we are conducting interviews with researchers using the Data Curation Profiles (DCP) toolkit to capture information about a particular data set itself (life cycle, purpose, perceived value) as well as information about the researcher’s needs and preferences with respect to that data set (whether, how, and when the data will be shared; needed documentation and description; and preservation requirements). To meet the specific needs of our project, we are soliciting information from researchers regarding what aspects of metadata they deem essential in supporting discovery, access and reuse of their data. The findings from the case studies are informing additional requirements for the DataStaR platform and its metadata representations. \n\nEnhancing the DataStaR Platform \n\nCurrent development is moving DataStaR in an important new direction, enabling research data discovery and data registry by collecting and maintaining metadata about research data created at an institution and providing the option to link these detailed dataset descriptions to research outputs, research activities, and personal profiles of researchers at that institution or elsewhere. Our research and development are focusing on capturing metadata useful for discovery across domains . \n\nThis project has been inspired in part by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) model for institutional participation in a broad national data registry infrastructure, with a few important differences. Because no national registry model yet exists in the United States, the DataStaR approach relies primarily on Linked Data as the discovery and aggregation method from distributed local staging repositories rather than harvesting metadata to a central metadata repository. \n\nThe Linked Data approach is a rapidly expanding mode of information sharing and exchange promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and other organizations that use standard Web protocols (HTTP) to allow Web pages to be exposed as structured data and not just human-readable text. By exposing the full metadata from publicly sharable datasets as Resource Description Format (RDF) statements, those metadata are available for harvesting and indexing as part of any research data registry or discovery service, yet they remain fully in the hands of the local institution and its participating researchers for updates and additions over time, including usage information, links to publications, additional data, and follow-on projects. DataStaR is being extended to interoperate with VIVO , a semantic researcher-networking platform also developed at Cornell using closely related technology. We believe the long-term impact of dynamic linked-data connections between distributed, locally maintained repositories of information about researchers, research datasets, and the datasets themselves has not yet been fully recognized. \n\nConclusion \n\nThis project is advancing the capabilities of research libraries by providing a tool for data sharing and ongoing discovery to other institutions with the option of developing a service for the needs of researchers and the service support capabilities of the libraries involved. A locally implemented DataStaR will also help make research data services and the research data itself more visible in the local institutional landscape as well as enable that information to be linked or aggregated for indexing and discovery functions across multiple institutions or by domain of interest. \n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography \n\nDietrich, D.

  "Abstract": "Introduction \n\nThe University of Queensland (UQ) is a research-intensive university. It is one of the top universities in Australia and in the top 100 worldwide. University systems to record research activities are paramount to promoting, reporting and helping to measure research performance. In 2002 UQ eSpace began life as the UQ Library institutional repository, known as ePrintsUQ, using eprints.org software. To meet the evolving needs to manage a range of university research material and to increase its flexibility the eprints.org software was replaced with Fedora in 2007, along with a locally developed frontend interface called Fez. By 2011 UQ eSpace http.//espace.library.uq.edu.au/ has evolved into an internationally renown repository system having reached number ten in the \"Ranking of World repositories .\" It is helping to promote UQ research worldwide through the augmented of eSpace with other UQ data management systems, that underpin critical research reporting needs required of Australian Universities by the Australian Government. \n\nOngoing development of the Fez software has enabled UQ eSpace to gradually extend its role in the management of official research publication outputs at The University of Queensland. In 2008, UQ eSpace staff worked with UQ’s Office of Research to develop workflows to support the input and management of records for the annual Higher Education Research Data Collection (HERDC) submission to the Australian Government and also worked with the UQ Graduate School to facilitate the electronic submission of research higher degree theses. Subsequently UQ eSpace took on a central role in the management of research publication outputs for a number of Australian Government initiatives such as the Research Quality Framework, the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) in 2010 and 2012. \n\nMethods \n\nThis paper will report generally on the processes to augment data from key systems with UQ eSpace. Details of the drivers and means to achieve academic compliance from every level of the University, based on engaging researchers and integrating with internal systems and external databases will be discussed. Descriptions will be provided on the types of data augmented, such as Thomson Web of Science citation counts and publication records, ResearcherID, Scopus citation counts, UQ staff data and other forms of staff data entry. The effort required for achieving significant collaboration and cooperation to fuse together disparate systems will be detailed. \n\nOutcomes \n\nUQ eSpace is a corporate tool. In February 2012 it comprises 159,182 records, 29,551 with full text, 53,421 with DOIs, and 72,201 with Thomson citation count, 52,189 with a Scopus citation count. There are 1,000 unique visitors to the search results page a day and over 21,000 visits a month. UQ eSpace grew in stature when used to report on the University’s research performance in 2010 and in 2012 for the ERA programs. \n\nUQ eSpace is now the single authoritative source for the research outputs of UQ staff and students and holds the official copy of all Research Higher Degrees theses submitted since 2008. It provides the essential corporate data for reporting requirements such as HERDC and ERA and for downstream UQ systems such as the Q-Index and UQ reSEARCHers . \n\nWhile playing this important role, UQ eSpace continues to function as a traditional institutional repository and encourages the deposit of open access publications and other digitised materials created by University staff, raising the visibility and accessibility of these publications to the wider world. As a repository it offers a wide array of options for the user – they can generate statistics, reports on external usage, produce cloud tags and automatically populate a research profile web page. \n\nConclusion \n\nFuture plans to expand the functionality of eSpace are ambitious; these include augmentation of citation data for benchmarking; bibliometric profiling of individual academics, research groups, schools and faculties; the creation of online academic portfolios; and the means to comply with Australian Government open access mandates. \n\nThe system has insatiable requirements for clever and creative technology developers to come up with robust and accurate solutions. To help reap rich academic awards and recognition UQ eSpace depends upon ongoing collaboration, cooperation and communication throughout the University and with international open repositories partners."

  "Abstract": "Let’s face it. Software documentation tends to be dry, dull and at times all too technical. Open source software communities in particular can be a bit short on user friendly guides and tutorials for users. And volunteers to work on such documentation are hard to come by. Enter the DuraSpace KnowledgeBase (https.//wiki.duraspace.org/display/KB/Welcome+to+KnowledgeBase). The KnowledgeBase was patterned after the Ruby on Rails \"Rail Guides\" (http.//guides.rubyonrails.org/) which provides users with multi-demensional resources for learning how to do stuff. Like the Rail Guides, the main focus of the KnowledgeBase is to show users how to perform specific functions, not just tell them. This is accomplished by providing as many visuals/examples as possible all while use language that is simple and not laden with technical jargon. \n\nSounds like a worthy effort, but how do you design such a resource and more importantly, how do you implement a framework that encourages content contributions from volunteers from the user community? The KnowledgeBase wiki-based structure has been specifically designed for ‘bite-sized’ content contributions. Anyone can step in and develop content using the recommended tools and templates to create a small section of the text guide or single topic screencast and have it fit into the larger, comprehensive guide. These community content contributions can generally be accomplished in just a hour or so. And very importantly, the KnowledgeBase design also includes a plan for quality control to ensure the content is useful, up-to-date and relevant. So, while volunteers for writing, editing or updating documentation in open source communities are generally hard to come by – volunteers to contribute small bites in a more dynamic environment like the KnowledgeBase, can be more successful. \n\nWhile the KnowledgeBase has been specifically designed for the DuraSpace technologies, this presentation will be presented in a broad, re-useable context – focusing on how others can build similar community-driven resources."

The development has been informed by a set of principles, and these have enabled the repository to support key foci within the University's Strategic Plan. Technical development has been undertaken through collaboration with the Hydra project and community, and the flexible platform this has provided has underpinned our aims for the role of the repository institutionally. These aims encompass the management of multiple types of content and integrating the repository with other relevant institutional systems to facilitate the flow, management and access of digital content wherever this is most appropriate. The Hydra technical stack has also provided the basis upon which we can sustain the repository and explore future uses, not least the integration of repository content discovery with other resource discovery systems.

  "Abstract": "This is a sideways look at digital preservation for articles held in institutional repositories. not the how but the what, why and when. \n\nThe big question is ‘what digital content in institutional repositories deserves our serious attention for its long-term preservation’? This is to recognize that there is more to institutional repositories than the final, peer-reviewed copy of a journal article held by the authors. There are arguments aplenty about the qualities that repositories should have for the long-term of that variety of content in terms future-proofing. This is especially important for that digital content that is regarded as significant for future scholarship, with particular relevance for a library’s stewardship of what is special – expensive to recreate or unique (in that any digital object is inherently unique). \n\nThe focus here, however, is more limited, concerning the author(s)’ final copy, the version of the article whose purpose in an OAI-PMH repository is to serve the open access agenda. The specific, narrower question becomes ‘what is of lasting value about the authors’ final copy’? Is it special in any way, or does its value lie solely in the business of providing open access to a version of what has otherwise been published, and is not regarded as unique? \n\nThis questioning is triggered by review of workshops and blogs in 2009 and by experience gained in working on two parallel developments being given attention at JISC and at EDINA (the UK national data centre at the University of Edinburgh). on the requirements for sustainable repository operation; on the requirements for long term preservation and access to e-journal content. \n\nThe first set of developments had its initial focus on facilities for the self-deposit of scholarly literature that is or should be held in institutional repositories in support of the open access agenda. That included the scoping and provision of the Depot and now opendepot.org, participation in the SONEX Group and related project work in OA Repository Junction as machine-to-machine broker re-directing content into the appropriate institutional repositories; most recently this has included the challenge of scoping and build of an underpinning socio-technical infrastructure for UK repositories, UKRepositoryNet+. \n\nThe second set of developments initially focused on cooperative activity in the UK LOCKSS Alliance and participation by the University of Edinburgh in the CLOCKSS initiative; this has latterly flourished with the Beta release of the Keepers Registry http.//thekeepers.org which records the activities of the variety of organizations archiving the issued content of e-journals. \n\nThe publisher’s final copy of the published article is generally acknowledged to be the version of record. But in this phase of the digital age custody of that version is not with repositories nor even with libraries. by default it is with the publishers. After teasing and prodding in a review of received wisdom about preservation responsibilities, this paper will examine future options for happy and sustainable relationship between repositories and the activities of organizations archiving the issued content of e-journals."

Digital repositories in Korea \n\nSince year 2003 Korean academic libraries started to utilize digital collection (dCollection) system and make digital repositories in their university. DCollection is the self-developed system by KERIS referring to Dspace and 219 universities in Korea are participating in it. Submitting theses mostly in printed form has been replaced by the online submission. This paper is to investigate the Korean digital repository system called dCollection widely used in Korea to submit online, convert, and open to public real-time with submission verification process. Next step we consider to move forward is how to connect, integrate other open repository platform/software and collect various types of resources such as multimedia materials. \n\n2. KERIS models of dCollecion system - dCollection features and characteristics \n\nDigital information distribution systems called dCollection installed at KERIS and deployed in the proprietary systems operated by university and are interconnected to the integrated system of KERIS. Under dCollection system, bibliographic data, information on the academic papers and original copies of academic resources are integrated through RISS and are bundled in an integrated service system that supports a nationwide service. Outstanding features of dCollection system are; online submission system, author self-archiving availability, institutional repository development, library-centered academic collection of universities, OAI-PMH compatible metadata harvesting, integrated searching and direct URL link to full text etc. With a start of 4 universities as experimental institutions in 2003 and now participating numbers are expanded to 219 in March, 2012. \n\nReferring to the scheme above in 2003, 1st. year of development dCollection was focused on harvesting, converting, and integrating the data, which include distribution system, central system, and service system. Two years later dCollection license system was made and the year after hosting system has developed for a wide use. In order to accommodate various research work \"Research Information System\", \"Researcher’s page\" were developed in 2007, 2009 respectively. Recently \"Community web-page\" for small university institute has just launched and the system will harvest multimedia contents soon."

  "Abstract": "Digital repositories are replacing traditional archives, and their functions largely exceed those of their ancestors. In a higher education institution, where multiple activities take place motivated by its teaching, research, community engagement and cultural missions, repositories may become endowed with a spectrum of functionalities that range from the support for teaching resources, the registry of academic publication, the management of research data, the preservation of heritage materials and the dissemination of timely news. \n\nIn this paper we are looking at the repository structure of U.Porto from the point of view of access rights and access restrictions. The experience at U.Porto has shown that an institutional repository does require considerable effort in the identification of the materials to be incorporated, and that a substantial part of that effort has to be devoted to the management of the access conditions. \n\nWe consider a set of case studies from U.Porto documents and analyze the processes required to make them available. The cases cover scientific papers, research data and administrative documents, and are just a sample of the many situations the university is facing in its mission of preserving the institutional memory and making resources available to a large audience in and outside the university. \n\nFor the scientific production, it is well known that authors are often not aware of their rights and, even in publications allowing them to have copies in the institutional repositories, they do not take the initiative to provide them. But even the internal process of publishing theses and dissertations, where a steady flow into the repository is expected, can take a long time to establish. Despite the existence of a common information system for almost 10 years now [1], U.Porto has a large diversity of practices and the process of thesis deposit is hindered by the fact that authors are allowed by general law to prevent the publication. \n\nThe recently created experimental data repository [2] provides the opportunity for researchers to preserve valuable datasets, sharing them within their community and even providing open access to data. The main issue in this area, as we have observed so far, is the lack of experience with data publication. If the possibility of publishing the data is not taken into account at the time researchers collect the data, it may become impracticable for them to obtain the required permissions at a later time, as this would involve new contacts with human subjects or extra conditions in existing contracts. \n\nA significant number of administrative documents have been digitized and are organized as part of the institutional repository (currently over 15.000 records). The access conditions for materials such as student processes and staff contracts have been objected even in the presence of a conservative publication policy. Portuguese law is very strict with respect to the publication of personal data, and therefore the inclusion of documents on past staff contracts, for instance, even when expurgated from components related to health, family, opinions and work evaluations, has required the consultation with the national authorities for administrative data access. The minutes of various university committees are considered public, but they can only be published after their decisions have been validated and even so they may include personal information for which access may not be granted. \n\nThe long history of U.Porto has amassed many valuable historic materials such as the files of former students, minutes of sessions of management bodies, architecture projects, legacies from former professors and students and donations from other, possibly extinct, bodies, with which U.Porto had institutional relations. These materials also raise specific access issues, which have to be considered individually. \n\nOverall, the experience with U.Porto repositories has shown that managing the access rights of repository documents is a time consuming tasks requiring ingenuity on the part of the repository managers to avoid getting trapped in complex and even contradictory legal conditions. The details of a large collection of cases for access rights can provide other repository managers with a realistic evaluation of the problems that arise when the institutional repositories go beyond the scientific production to expose the administrative processes and the miscellaneous documents resulting from the multiple activities of the university. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n[1] Eugénia Matos Fernandes, Lígia Ribeiro.

  "Abstract": "Traditional models of publishing and scholarship have served research needs effectively for a long time. Databases and digital repositories, both open and closed, have made great strides in archiving content, broadening access, and offering new mechanisms for content discovery. But now it is clear that this game is changing and there is a real danger that players in this complex ecosystem who cannot adapt will be left behind. \n\nEven for researchers who have been slow to embrace the latest technologies, day-to-day experiences with Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Apple and collaborative tools such as Academia.edu, and LabArchives are raising the bar. Network-driven tools are reducing the friction in peer interactions; paving the way for new possibilities in sharing, curating, describing, analyzing, annotating and enriching content and ideas; and harnessing the knowledge and creative force of communities for the benefit of all. And rapid evolution of technologies and devices is expanding the expectations gap for current solutions. Researchers want to be delighted with a seamless workflow and experience -- anytime, anyplace, and on any platform -- and this has become exceedingly difficult with the tools that they are using. \n\nOptimizing the end-to-end researcher experience will be the new currency for all information providers – whether they be commercial or not-f0r-profit. Increasingly, access to relevant content is just expected and focus is shifting from quality of scholarly inputs to the nature of the research experiences and outcomes. What will distinguish one service from another will be recollection of how it sparks and harnesses the exchange and interplay of ideas for all users together, while enhancing creativity, and setting the stage for breakthroughs in research. \n\nWhile the impact of scholarship is also being measured by key outputs such as articles completed or citations measures, new collaborative technologies and tools offer the promise of measuring not just scholarship completed but also a complete array of contributions to scholarship within digital communities. The best completed work and the best work in progress can be remixed to spark and sustain dialog that enriches current and future scholarly work. The exchange of ideas, surveys, findings, data, code, and methodologies can offer tremendous value for communities. Instead of just capturing and revealing the scholarly record from the sands of time, these rich content sources can now become the spade or shaping tools that is used by communities to build something totally new and special. The 21st Century repository should offer the potential to recast and remix academic work from the past and present to create energy, community, and entirely new academic outputs where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. \n\nOne content area where this transformation could have a significant impact is with dissertations. Dissertations play a seminal and central role in the scholarly communications ecosystem. They launch the careers of new scholars and raise the profile of institutions, departments, and advisors. They are a rich source of cited works for deep literature reviews and a valuable source of metadata for citation analysis. Given the long gestation periods for journal articles, they can often provide early insight into trends in research methods and new theories, inventions, and discoveries. Expanding the reach and impact of graduate works is critical for the comprehensiveness and the continued sustainable expansion of the global academic record. \n\nThe global landscape for electronic theses and dissertations is undergoing a period of profound change. Dissertations as a medium of scholarly communication are being redefined as they become enriched with datasets, rich media, photographs, graphics, and as there can often be multiple versions disseminated for each work. This evolution will continue as accessibility of new research materials and technologies for graduate researchers drives increasing use of innovative research methods such as text mining and historical reconstruction of locations via geodata. And new challenges are on the horizon as the scope of graduate research continues to expand, with topics and findings becoming more interdisciplinary and global in their orientation. \n\nGiven the rapid pace, scale and scope of these changes on the electronic theses and dissertations landscape and the expectations gap for academic researchers, libraries and information providers will both have important roles to play in driving the transformations that will be needed. For example, new technological capabilities and standards are needed to facilitate discoverability and effective archiving of foreign language and non-text material. Dissertations output from China and the needs of today’s humanities scholars are notable examples. In addition, enhanced or linked metadata will be required to facilitate discovery of works that cut across disciplines. And critical avenues for collaboration exist in harnessing the power of identifiers. Projects such as ISNI and ORCID have the potential to help in the discovery of individual works and the linking of these works to the appropriate authors, departments, and institutions. \n\nThis highly interactive session will examine the changing electronic theses and dissertations landscape, emerging avenues for collaboration between libraries and information providers, and the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead."

  "Abstract": "The University of Salford has had an Open Access mandate in place since January 2010, and the University of Salford Institutional Repository (USIR) has grown considerably during this time, in size, range of content and reputation. \n\nLike other institutions Salford has spent time and effort on our advocacy programs. Salford has taken this one step further and commissioned a set of externally facilitated focus groups that has enabled the Library to uncover how USIR is really perceived and used by researchers at Salford. \n\nThe results have left us with the conclusion that even when time and effort has been put into advocacy programmes, promotion and training, people can still get things wrong and misunderstand. This work has given the Library an opportunity to reflect on the progress of our Open Access work to date, to think about these outcomes in line with the results received to our ‘Unlocking attitudes to Open Access’ survey (devised by RSP and UKCoRR) and to plan a new way forward for our advocacy activities to try and alleviate these misunderstandings."

  "Abstract": "Information technology and resources have thoroughly transformed the conduct of the scholarly enterprise, particularly with regard to data-intensive scholarship. Ubiquitous connectivity (e.g., Wifi, 4G, etc.), high-level web discovery (Bing, Google, Yahoo, etc.), and new modes of online discourse (social media) have reset the expectations of the scholarly community for the use of research data in teaching, learning, and publication, not just for the physical sciences, but for the social sciences and humanities as well. Many memory institutions are facing new challenges to respond effectively to the demands of their user constituencies to support services appropriate for today’s – and tomorrow’s – dynamic information environment. \n\nThe University of California Curation Center (UC3) of the California Digital Library (CDL) has a broad mission to provide a comprehensive suite of strategic services focused on the long-term management, curation, use, re-use, and re-purposing of the University’s research output. In order to respond to the diverse requirements of data-intensive scholarship, UC3 is augmenting its repository and ancillary services to provide a higher level of data-related function. As an organizing principle for its workplan, UC3 uses a data lifecycle approach to determine the major functional capabilities necessary for the new scholarship data paradigm."

  "Abstract": "Utrecht University Library has been digitizing its Special Collections for over a decade. Over the years, half a dozen different websites were created to present the results to the public. After the first few years, the library installed DSpace. From then on, the masterfiles from the digitization where archived. But none of the websites made direct use of DSpace. \n\nIn 2010 we started a major project to replace our outdated Special Collections websites with something new. One of the main requirements was to use the DSpace repository as the basis for the archiving and dissemination of metadata and for the generation of display versions of the master files. \n\nWe will show the changes we made by way of 'before and after' images. \n\nFirst we had a confusing variety of databases, websites and processes. Now we have a single, easy to manage process from digitization request to presentation on a single website. \n\nWe also list some of the problems we faced in getting to where we are now. For instance. a million new jpg files had to be generated, which took rather longer than we had first anticipated."

  "Authors": ["Tim Brody", "Leslie Carr"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Southampton, United Kingdom"],
  "Abstract": "Microsoft Sharepoint is a Web-publishing and content management platform to support collaborative working within the corporate environment. The central concept of Sharepoint is a site that brings together the activities related to a project or team. This can include blogs, wikis, document sharing or calendars. These sites are created and managed by non-technical users (site owners) using GUI Web-based tools. Site templates and individual features (Web Parts) can be created for site owners to base new sites on or to add new features to existing sites. \n\nThe objective of this project is to add repository-like features to Sharepoint. Repository software is a kind of content management system that is focused on particular use-cases. \n\nproviding an ingest workflow, storage and preservation of digital objects \n\npublishing metadata and objects to the Web and 3rd party services. \n\nThere are some key technologies that a repository software should support. the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (sharing records), the SWORD protocol for record deposit and a RESTful-like URL structure that enables the repository to be effectively indexed by Web search engines. \n\nSharepoint already provides some basic ingest workflow and storage features for digital objects through its collection objects –sets of records with customisable metadata fields that can have files attached – and which form the basis of the enhanced repository functionality. To this end we have built an AtomPub/SWORD interface that allows digital objects to be inserted into a collection. \n\nWhile Sharepoint is a Web-based application, the URL structure it uses it not friendly towards Web crawlers. To improve this we have added new application page types to (a) render collections as browsable lists and (b) render individual repository items as individual web pages that provide structured access to the item's metadata. \n\nThis proposed demo will show how a SharePoint server can be used interchangeably with an EPrints or DSpace repository by a SWORD UI client. The purpose of this work is two-fold. Firstly, to enable technical integration between Sharepoint services and OA repositories. Secondly, to allow institutions to leverage their corporate Sharepoint investment to gain repository functionality. \n\nThis work is supported by a Microsoft grant."

  "Abstract": "The quality of academic research outputs is often judged based on several different factors, most of which are based on scores of one kind or another, for example citation counts, journal impact factors, or h-indexes. These scores and metrics allow researchers to make comparisons with their peers, measure productivity, and assess the impact of their work. \n\nOpen Access to the research literature has become a strategic goal for many funders of research and very recently the UK government. Unfortunately there is currently no way to put a score on an academics level of engagement with open access. How well are they doing? What potential do they have? How many of the journals that they publish in allow them to publish open access? How many of these opportunities have they taken? \n\nA synthesis of this engagement could be represented by a relatively simple numerical score – the Open Access Index. We are now in a position where we should be able to measure this. With a myriad of sources from large bibliographic databases, current research information systems, repositories and SHERPA Romeo, we have access to the information that we need to calculate such a score. \n\nThe project will examine whether such an index would be useful, how it should be calculated, provide some worked examples, seek expert input into all of this, and disseminate its findings.",

The session will give an demonstration of how different plugins can be combined to give you a recipe. Examples include social data recipe and a middle-ware teaching recipe. The session concludes with users suggesting combinations of features to create their own recipes with demo repositories available so that participants can &quot;mix&quot; their own."
