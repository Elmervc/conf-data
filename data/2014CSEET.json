            "Abstract": "University education in software engineering instructs sound theoretical concepts together with method competence. It seeks to provide hands-on experience with the learning content along with insights into its application in practice. Even theoretical disciplines are beginning to adopt more experience-oriented instruction as opposed to passive, lecture-oriented instruction. One favored way for experience-oriented instructions is using case studies in lecture-accompanying assignments and/or tutorials. Compared with real-world scenarios, such case studies are often simplified in order to illustrate specific challenges related to the instructed material. This paper reports on our experience in using realistic industry-oriented case studies in a requirements engineering course with graduate students. The experience indicates a strong positive effect on student motivation as well as the degree of comprehension of the instructed theoretical material. These findings are confirmed by evaluations of the learning experience as self-reported through students’ questionnaires. Comparing the exam results with previous years indicates substantial improvement in final exam scores.",

            "Abstract": "Requirements are of paramount importance for the quality of software systems. For various reasons, however, university students encounter difficulties in understanding the role of requirements and appropriately applying relevant methods to deal with requirements. This paper describes the concept for teaching requirements engineering that was devised at Coburg University of Applied Sciences. As a key idea, teaching requirements starts out from business process models. From these models, requirements for a workflow appli¬cation can be derived and specified in a requirements document. A main benefit of this approach lies in the fact that requirements are not just presented as an abstract concept. Furthermore, students are exposed to the complexity of an almost realistic workflow application. Being more realistic than a toy project, the latter also improves understanding why requirements should be described precisely and provides opportunities to also exercise non-technical competencies that are important for successful requirements engineering.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud Computing is changing the services consumption and delivery platform as well as the way businesses and users interact with IT resources. It represents a major conceptual shift that introduces new elements in programming models and development environments that are not present in traditional technologies. The evolution of Cloud Computing motivates teaching Cloud Computing to computer science senior students and graduate students so that they can gain broad exposure to the main body of knowledge of Cloud Computing and get prepared for occupations in industry. There is thus a strong need for having a Cloud Computing education course that (i) has a broad coverage of different roles interacting with a cloud; and (ii) leverages Cloud Computing concepts, technology and architecture topics at both introductory and advanced level. In this paper, we describe the demand for understanding the impact of Cloud Computing in computer science higher education. We propose education strategies for teaching Cloud Computing, including key knowledge areas for an enduring Cloud Computing course.",

            "Abstract": "This paper describes the findings on ‘flipping the classroom’ pedagogy for one selected topic in the Software Engineering module. A flipped classroom is a form of blended learning where the lecture is moved outside the classroom with the help of technology and learning activities are moved inside the classroom. The students typically watch instructional videos outside of the classroom but participate in learning activities with other students in class. This allows students to learn on their own time and pace outside class time while enabling the lecturer to enhance interaction, collaboration and higher-order thinking of students by monitoring individual learning and task performance. Our past experience has shown that using the traditional approach to teach software engineering, which is a heavily conceptual and theoretical subject, can be challenging. Against this backdrop, we have devised a flipped class room trial to let the students carry out the learning activities before coming to class where they then share and apply the knowledge during face-to-face lessons for more engaging learning experience. As this is an initial trial, the author has chosen a topic that is relatively easy to understand and with support of interesting videos readily available online. The purpose is to motivate the use of flipped classroom for appropriate topics taught in Software Engineering curriculum.",

            "Abstract": "Software inspections are recommended for improving the quality of software artifacts, but their effectiveness heavily depends on properly training inspectors and other stakeholders in the inspection process. We previously proposed InspectorX, a serious game for learning and training on software inspections, whose design accounts for an optimized cognitive load by offering different levels of difficulty. The game has already been evaluated regarding its learning potential in the detection of defects, revealing positive outcomes. Since then, InspectorX has extended its coverage to other stages of the inspection process, for a more realistic simulation. This paper presents the game’s novel features and a new experiment that evaluates them with a bigger sample. Results indicate that there was considerable knowledge retention with just 20 minutes of gameplay. Suggestions on its design made by the experiment volunteers are also discussed.",

Though a variety of software design concepts, such as information hiding, separation of concerns and patterns are taught to undergraduate students, they often have difficulty applying these concepts to the analysis of designs and particularly to comparing designs, perhaps due to the subjective nature of these concepts. Our new technique complements design structure matrix and ‘uses’ techniques to handle asymmetric dependency impacts and provide a deterministic approach to comparing alternative designs. A major goal of this technique was for students to be able to quickly learn about dependencies and use them to make design decisions. In this paper we present findings from a study with thirty third- and fourth-year undergraduates indicating that most were able to use the technique to analyze and compare designs after a single short workshop and indicate that they are likely to continue use the technique in the future.",

Although the Software Engineering discipline had been recognized since 1968, there is still no agreement among the Universities worldwide about what should be included in the Software Engineering curriculums or study plans. This problem has resulted in that different knowledge areas are being taught to the Software Engineering students in different universities. Also this problem has resulted in that many universities now include courses in the Software Engineering curriculum that are not related to Software Engineering. A case study of the Jordanian Universities had proved that more than 60% of the courses taught at the Software Engineering departments of the Jordanian Universities are non Software Engineering related courses. An analysis had been conducted to compare the current Software Engineering courses taught at the different Jordanian Universities and the guidance provided by the ACM/IEEE about what should constitute an undergraduate Software Engineering education. Also an analysis of the Software Engineering courses taught at different countries such as UK and USA had been conducted where these countries were chosen because they contain many of the top ranked Universities in the world. The analysis had resulted in determining the knowledge areas that should be added to the curriculum of each Jordanian University. Enhancing the curriculum will result in a SE graduates that are equipped with the needed knowledge to join the software market.",

SingPath is an web based tool for users to practice programming in several software languages. The platform started as a tool to provide students with online feedback on solutions to programming problems and expanded over time to support different of blended learning needs for a variety of classes and classroom settings. The SingPath platform supports traditional self-directed learning mechanisms such as badges and completion metrics as well as features for use in classrooms, such as tournaments. We evaluate the addition of the mentor assignment feature during two short workshops designed to introduce students to the Python and JavaScript programming languages. The introduction of the mentor assignment features provided a more collaborative and engaging experience compared with previous courses.",

This paper proposes the use of particular ThinkLets (a process pattern to address collaboration recurrent problems) to help overcome particular problems that jeopardize teamwork.

We present the synopsis of an assignment whose purpose is to demonstrate the significance of such skills, including effective communication, team coordi- nation and collaboration, and overall project planning. The assignment is organized in the context of a distributed software engineering course carried out in collaboration with 12 universities in South America, Europe and Africa. The assignment is a globally distributed contest issued before most development activities related to the course’s software project are performed, aiming at favor- ing the collaboration between students prior to project development. The contest does not involve any programming, and is not related to the project development activities. Instead, it consists of making teams in different countries compete in collaboratively solving a set of very simple tasks. The complexity of the activity is in team collaboration and coordination, and their lack is evident when the tasks are not correctly solved, or not solved in time. Despite the simplicity of the as- signment, students have found it useful in helping them understand the significance of management and planning challenges in distributed software development. Moreover, the assignment helped in team building, by creating a better team atmosphere and contributing in identifying team members better suited for management.",

However, we do not yet have an established method to determine the optimal team composition to achieve maximum educational effectiveness. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate how personal characteristics and the learning process of team members affect educational effectiveness by examining a university course in which students work in teams on a realistic project in a classroom setting. We use the Five Factors and Stress (FFS) theory and the modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA) to measure the personal characteristics and to identify the learning process of each team member. Additionally, we compare the learning process of a team with a high educational effectiveness to one with a low educational effectiveness based on number of topics about the learning process and the kind of topics. As a result, we find that it is better for a team to have members with different personal characteristic as defined by FFS theory in order for the students to acquire more knowledge and skills through the course. Additionally, teams that focus on fewer learning process topics acquire more knowledge and skills. We expect that our findings will help increase the educational effectiveness in similar practical courses.",

The course is composed of 6-hour lecture and 32-hour bidding game. Preliminary results indicated several advantages with this new education approach on process-specific practicing course, which we already reported on CSEE&amp;T2013. Since this course has been delivered to students from school (less experiences) and industry (more experiences), we noticed students’ different performances on this course.

            "Abstract": "Agile methods are widely adopted in software development. They are based on agile principles that sharply contrast to traditional command-and-control management methods. Such methods emphasize the importance of highly interactive self-organizing teams and close collaboration of all stakeholders, as well as values like courage, openness and respect. However, recent studies show that graduates and undergraduates of computer science often lack the collaborative and communicative skills necessary for agile methods and, thus, are not yet well enough educated for agile development approaches. Therefore, new approaches or more adequate educational methods for teaching the necessary communication and collaboration skills need to be developed. In a recent interview study, the authors elicited specific collaboration and communication skills needed in agile teams. In this paper, we present results from this study and discuss teaching concepts for collaboration skills from both engineering and psychological points of view. We suggest an approach on how to integrate these concepts into university courses, that focuses on active learning of agile collaboration. We have started implementing the proposed concept in a software engineering course and report on the experiences we have made and on the challenges that we have encountered.",

A main barrier to successful collaboration emerges due to social dilemmas that can be traced back to a profound tension between what is desirable for a collective as a whole, e. g. a software development team, and what is desirable for an individual, e. g. a single coder. This position paper introduces the concept of win-for-all (winn) and applies it to software engineering education. winn is an all-purpose pattern of thought for group processes with the aim to optimally balance individual and group needs. Thus, winn is a prerequisite for sustainable and high-quality performance of the whole group, the latter being a central issue for software engineering. High-level performance can only be achieved through a systemic perspective: both, the group and the individual (as a fundamental element of the group) have to be considered. Consequently, there is also still a lot of potential for teaching and improving collaboration in software engineering education.",

A group of researchers, from institutions in multiple territories, has embarked on an ambitious research project that is aimed at enhancing the teaching of software engineering in four-year undergraduate programs. The research project details a set of workshops, for which the objective is the capture of data that will be the basis of the research effort. The first of these workshops was held in August 2011. The workshop comprised software engineering educators and representatives from the information technology industry. The data collection task sought to identify a set of topics that are considered suitable for teaching software engineering, along with identification of the years and depth at which these topics should be taught. The topics are derived from the outcome goals of the course/program.",

            "Abstract": "Many schools do not begin to introduce college students to software engineering until they have had at least one semester of programming. Since software engineering is a large, complex, and abstract subject it is difficult to construct active learning exercises that build on the students’ elementary knowledge of programming and still teach basic software engineering principles. It is also the case that beginning students typically know how to construct small programs, but they have little experience with the techniques necessary to produce reliable and long-term maintainable modules. I have addressed these two concerns by defining a local standard (Montana Tech Method (MTM) Software Development Standard for Small Modules Template) that step-by-step directs students toward the construction of highly reliable small modules using well known, best-practices software engineering techniques. “Small module” is here defined as a coherent development task that can be unit tested, and can be carried out by a single (or a pair of) software engineer(s) in at most a few weeks. The standard describes the process to be used and also provides a template for the top-level documentation. The instructional module’s sequence of mini-lectures and exercises associated with the use of this (and other) local standards are used throughout the course, which perforce covers more abstract software engineering material using traditional reading and writing assignments. The sequence of mini-lectures and hands-on assignments (many of which are done in small groups) constitutes an instructional module that can be used in any similar software engineering course.",
