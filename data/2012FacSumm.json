  "Authors": ["Eric Horvitz"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research"],
  "Abstract": "Representations of probability and utility lie at the heart of a two-decade rolling revolution in machine learning and intelligence. A confluence of advances has led to an inflection in our ability to collect, store, and harness large amounts of data for generating insights and guiding decision making in the open world. Beyond study and refinement of principles, fielding real-world systems is critical for testing the sufficiency of algorithms and implications of assumptions—and exploring the human dimension of computational solutions and services. Horvitz will discuss efforts on learning and inference, highlighting key ideas in the context of projects in transportation, health care, and citizen science. Next, he will describe the composition of integrative solutions that draw upon a symphony of skills and that operate over extended periods of time."

  "Authors": ["Sharad Goel", "Jamie Pennebaker", "Zeynep Tufekci"],
  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research", "University of Texas", "University of North Carolina"],
  "Abstract": "This session addresses the study and use of social media. Social media have massively democratized the production and distribution of information, and as such are impacting virtually every aspect of our world, from politics and the economy to news and even crisis management. For scientists who want to study this phenomenon, social media represent a body of information that is real-time, largely text-based, semi-structured, highly diverse, and embedded in social structures. Thus, social media are of interest to a tremendous range of scientists, including ethnographers, sociologists, computer scientists, and computational linguists. This session will focus on techniques, application areas, and research opportunities in the social media domain."

  "Type": "Talk",
  "Key": "EndUserProgrammingforMobileDevices",
  "Authors": ["Christoph Csallner", "Suresh Lodha"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Texas at Arlington", "University of California, Santa Cruz"],
  "Abstract": "In 2012, we are in the middle of a technology shift. instead of using PCs and laptops, mobile devices are becoming more prevalent for most everyday computing tasks. In fact, never before in human history were incredibly powerful and versatile computing devices such as smartphones available and adopted so broadly. In this session, we will discuss whether and how end-users can program mobile computing devices for fun and to automate tasks and implications for teaching computer science in today’s classrooms. Microsoft Research created the novel application creation environment TouchDevelop, which enables end users to author programs on smartphones—without a PC. This session will compare the traditional approach of using established programming languages to write mobile applications on a PC to novel programming approaches that enable creating applications on mobile devices directly. By mining existing mobile programming environments, we can infer what kind of applications end-users want to create and what challenges they face."

  "Abstract": "Increasingly, being able to visualize large collections of data is absolutely vital in the domain of cultural heritage—both for scholarly work and public consumption. Recent work explores novel and engaging ways to visualize and explore cultural heritage data collections. See demos of applications built on Microsoft PixelSense and tablets that demonstrate the advantages of pen and touch computing for enhancing the user experience of specific applications. These range from handwriting mathematics with pen or finger as input, to mathematical solvers, to using multitouch interaction for exploring large-format artworks in their rich context of related artworks, annotations, and guided tours. We will also explore the technological and social challenges of creating interactive exhibits around the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest community-created piece of folk art in the world. These applications are a beachhead on the untouched shores of big humanities research. They are what we can actually expect today and in the near future and are also first steps towards what might define an ideal user interface."

  "Authors": ["Ahmed Hassan", "Robin Moeur", "Ranga Narasimhan", "Cameron Turner"],
  "Affiliations": ["Queens University", "Microsoft Research", "Microsoft", "Microsoft"],
  "Abstract": "Software development generates an inordinate amount of data. For example, check-ins, work items, and test executions are recorded in software repositories such as CVS, Subversion, GIT, and Bugzilla. Telemetry data reflects how customers experience software, which includes application and feature usage and exposes reliability. The sheer amount is impressive. for the 10,000 projects monitored by the web-page CIA.vc, every 17 seconds a commit takes place. The open-source platform SourceForge.net hosts more than 300,000 projects, and according to Github.com, 1 million people host 2.9 million GIT repositories. The bug database of the Mozilla Firefox projects now contains almost 700,000 reports, according to Ohloh.net. Microsoft has many sources of development data at similar scale. But how can this data be used to improve software projects? Software development analytics takes this data and turns it into insight to inform better development decisions. Analytics is commonly used in many businesses—notably in marketing, to better reach and understand customers. The application of analytics to software development is becoming more popular. In this session, we present successful efforts from Microsoft and academia that turn software development data into actionable insight."

  "Affiliations": ["Microsoft Research", "University of Southern California", "University of Southern California", "Catholic University Law School", "University of New Hampshire"],
  "Abstract": "Networked technologies—including the Internet, mobile phones, and social media—alter how information flows and how people communicate. There is little doubt that technology is increasingly playing a role in the practices and processes surrounding human trafficking. the illegal trade of people for commercial sexual exploitation, forced labor, and other forms of modern-day slavery. Human trafficking has many facets to it and technology’s role varies as a result. Yet, little is known about costs and benefits of technology’s role. We do not know if there are more human trafficking victims as a result of technology, nor do we know if law enforcement can identify perpetrators better as a result of the traces that they leave. We do know that technology makes many aspects of human trafficking more visible and more traceable, for better and for worse. Focusing on whether technology is good or bad misses the point; it is here to stay, and it is imperative that we understand its role. More importantly, we need to develop innovative ways of using technology to address the horrors of human trafficking. This panel will explore ways in which technologists can use data traces to help address challenges in the human trafficking arena, paying particular attention to the commercial sexual exploitation of children. We will discuss ways in which technology can help identify perpetrators or victims, empower law enforcement, and disrupt organized crime. We will also examine the complex tensions involved in balancing the need to combat child victimization with the importance of civil liberties and privacy. Finally, we will discuss the possibilities of—and need for—technical innovation that can counter human trafficking abuses."

  "Type": "Talk",
  "Key": "TheChangingLandscapeofParallelComputingI",
  "Authors": ["Krste Asanović", "Tim Mattson", "Josep Torrellas"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of California, Berkeley", "Intel", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"],
  "Abstract": "For decades, the microprocessor industry improved the performance of on-chip processors by increasing the number of operations executed per CPU cycle. By 2007, it was clear that heat and power would limit further increases in clock rates. Today, it is widely accepted that performance gains can only be obtained by putting more than one processor in a single chip. Multicore parallelism represents a paradigm shift that breaks the 50-year tradition of conventional sequential programming models and software development. Knowing that research in this area would have deep implications, Microsoft and Intel launched in 2008 the Universal Parallel Computing Research Centers (UPCRC) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and UC Berkeley. Through this unique collaboration, Microsoft, Intel, UIUC, and UC Berkeley have joined forces to conduct research into all aspects of parallelism at the client, including architectures, operating systems, run-time middleware, programming tools and libraries, and applications. During this session, researchers from Microsoft, Intel, UC Berkeley, and UIUC will share the outcomes of their three-year efforts and will present their insights about new directions in the changing landscape of parallel computing."

  "Type": "Keynote",
  "Key": "RiversofIceVanishingGlaciersoftheGreaterHimalaya",
  "Authors": ["David Breashears"],
  "Affiliations": ["GlacierWorks"],
  "Abstract": "The Himalaya Mountains are home to the world’s most magnificent peaks and thousands of high-altitude glaciers. These important glaciers supply crucial seasonal flows to rivers across Asia, yet many are disappearing at an increasing rate. In this session, mountaineer and photographer David Breashears presents his recent photographs of the world’s least studied glaciers. By comparing them to archival photographs taken over the past century by the world’s greatest alpine photographers, the alarming loss of ice is starkly revealed. \n \nSince 2007, GlacierWorks has embarked upon 11 expeditions to the greater Himalayas. Breashears will describe the increasingly sophisticated imaging technology that the GlacierWorks team has employed to capture high-resolution photography of a wide range of glaciers and their surrounding geography—resulting in terabytes of high-resolution images from hundreds of strategic locations throughout the greater Himalayan region. These images, along with terabytes of images captured during a series of helicopter flights around Mount Everest, are being built into the highest resolution 3-D point cloud ever created of the Himalayan region. \n \nGlacierWorks’ extensive imagery, along with archival media, is currently being incorporated into an immersive Internet experience, which uses Rich Interactive Narratives technology from Microsoft Research. GlacierWorks hopes, through interactive and engaging educational experiences such as this, to interest students in gaining a better understanding of climate change’s impact on the glaciers and river systems of Asia."
