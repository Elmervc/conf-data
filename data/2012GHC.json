  "Type": "Invited Technical Speakers",
  "Key": "UsingProcessModelingandAnalysisTechniquestoReduceErrorsinHealthCare",
  "Authors": ["Lori A. Clarke"],
  "Affiliations": ["University of Massachusetts"],
  "Abstract": "As has been widely reported in the news lately, heath care errors are a major cause of death and suffering. In the University of Massachusetts Medical Safety Project, we are exploring the use of process modeling and analysis technologies to help reduce medical errors and improve efficiency. Specifically, we are modeling health care processes using a process definition language and then analyzing these processes using model checking, fault-tree analysis, discrete event simulation, and other analysis techniques. Working with the UMASS School of Nursing and the Baystate Medical Center, we are undertaking in-depth case studies on error-prone and life-critical health care processes. In many ways, these processes are similar to complex, distributed systems with many interacting, concurrent threads and numerous exceptional conditions that must be handled carefully. This talk describes the technologies we are using, discusses the case studies, and presents our observations and findings to date. Although presented in terms of the health care domain, the described approach could be applied to human-intensive processes in other domains to provide a technology-driven approach to process improvement."

We have been studying distributed work for 20 years, resulting in a rich body of cases and an emerging theory about the factors that should be in place to ensure success. In this talk I will offer a brief overview of these success followed by a description of an online assessment tool, the Collaboration Success Wizard, which embodies the theory and provides advice about how teams can mitigate the areas where they might be vulnerable. This tool provides a helpful (free) assessment with advice to those who take it, while providing data for us to verify and refine our theory of collaboration success."

  "Abstract": "Deception is a form of adversarial behavior that disrupts regular behavior of a system. I explored deception detection in two areas. authorship recognition and web phishing. Authorship recognition techniques can identify authors with high accuracy in non-adversarial scenarios, but their accuracy is reduced to random guessing when authors intentionally change their writing style. In phishing attack, malicious websites that are visually similar to authentic sites are used to deceive users."

  "Abstract": "Inspired by today’s teens, we began by thinking about how young kids can be encouraged to be creative by making the kind of software they love to use. games, search, and social networking programs. Typically it is very challenging to build complex experiences. We’ve built several tools to simplify this experience. First, we designed a game making tool called Kodu- which teaches programming and design concepts to kids, which is used on over 200 countries around the world. Kodu lets kids build the kind of games they play, rich visual multiplayer games on the xbox or PC. We then built a tool called Montage, for creating rich documents by using the search metaphor- typing a word to begin the authoring process, and So.cl, a social network for sharing rich content and interests. We then allow students to reuse the data in so.cl to create their own versions of search and social networking tools. It’s our hope that we can inspire more kids to code and design software, to imagine and create future versions of the tools they use every day."

This paper presents a reconfigurable many-core platform performing biomedical and DSP applications containing 64 cores routed in a hierarchical network. To demonstrate an application, electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure detection and analysis is mapped onto the cores. The seizure detection and analysis algorithm, when mapped onto 61 cores, takes 5663 cycles to execute in 14.45 us. The prototype is implemented in 65 nm CMOS which contains 64 cores and occupies 8.41 mm2. AND Big Data in HPC Applications and Programming Abstractions Abstract. We study leveraging current programming abstractions from computational-intensive HPC and data-intensive computing for data-intensive HPC applications. We study the applicability of two programming models (MPI/MPI- IO from computational-intensive HPC and MapReduce from data-intensive computing) to a variety of data-intensive HPC applications. We propose new frameworks, Reduced Function Set Abstraction (RFSA) for MPI-IO and MapReduce with Access Patterns (MRAP), which improve both performance and programmer productivity of emerging data-intensive HPC applications. AND Investigating Evolutionary Algorithms for Security in Biomedical Wireless Sensor Networks Abstract. As information transmitted in biomedical wireless sensor networks (BWSN) consists of critical and sensitive patient health and personal information, securing these networks is central to their practical deployment in healthcare applications. In this work, we design and develop intelligent intrusion detection techniques capable of improving security in BWSN. To that end, we propose a multi- objective genetic algorithm based intrusion detection system to provide optimal attack detection in BWSN.",

  "Abstract": "Abstract. As has been widely reported in the news lately, heath care errors are a major cause of death and suffering. In the University of Massachusetts Medical Safety Project, we are exploring the use of process modeling and analysis technologies to help reduce medical errors and improve efficiency. Specifically, we are modeling health care processes using a process definition language and then analyzing these processes using model checking, fault-tree analysis, discrete event simulation, and other analysis techniques. Working with the UMASS School of Nursing and the Baystate Medical Center, we are undertaking in-depth case studies on error-prone and life-critical health care processes. In many ways, these processes are similar to complex, distributed systems with many interacting, concurrent threads and numerous exceptional conditions that must be handled carefully. This talk describes the technologies we are using, discusses the case studies, and presents our observations and findings to date. Although presented in terms of the health care domain, the described approach could be applied to human-intensive processes in other domains to provide a technology-driven approach to process improvement",

  "Abstract": "Abstract. Inspired by today’s teens, we began by thinking about how young kids can be encouraged to be creative by making the kind of software they love to use. games, search, and social networking programs. Typically it is very challenging to build complex experiences. We’ve built several tools to simplify this experience. First, we designed a game making tool called Kodu- which teaches programming and design concepts to kids, which is used on over 200 countries around the world. Kodu lets kids build the kind of games they play, rich visual multiplayer games on the xbox or PC. We then built a tool called Montage, for creating rich documents by using the search metaphor- typing a word to begin the authoring process, and So.cl, a social network for sharing rich content and interests. We then allow students to reuse the data in so.cl to create their own versions of search and social networking tools. \n\nIt’s our hope that we can inspire more kids to code and design software, to imagine and create future versions of the tools they use every day.",

Research studies suggest students form opinions about whether they enjoy science or non-science subjects as early as middle school and make course selections based on their interests of preparing for college (Hardnett, 2007). This is especially true for girls (Stone & Church, 1984). This panel is for undergraduate students, graduate students, teachers (K-12), researchers, faculty members, industry workers, and anyone else interested in not only increasing the representation of women of color in CS, but also in shaping how CS engages girls and women of color during K-12.",

Yet, despite the uptick of interest in computer science majors and the surge of technology shaping all aspects of our lives, the numbers of women majoring in computer science are still abysmally small. In this talk, I will reflect on why this is the case, and make connections to the issues raised in Stuck in the Shallow End. Education, Race, and Computing—the underrepresentation in computer science of students of color. As this talk is occurring one month before critical US national elections, I will examine how underrepresentation in computing relates to the larger issues we face as world citizens.",
