      "Abstract": "Abstract: Korz is a new computational model that combines implicit arguments (constituting context) with multiple dispatch, in a slot-based model. Slots from a multidimensional space are drawn together into \u201cobjects\u201d subjectively, in different ways in different contexts. The combination of these few concepts powerfully supports evolution and contextual variation along multiple dimensions. Korz holds promise as a foundation for future languages that deeply integrate object-oriented, aspect-oriented and context-oriented capabilities. Nonetheless, a number of issues remain to be resolved.",

      "Abstract": "Abstract: Thirty years ago Emerald proposed a compelling vision of a distributed object-based future, in which objects with identity and state could migrate seamlessly from one host to another. While Emerald improved on many of its successors, I argue that neither Emerald\u2019s specific choices for maintaining consistency and availability in the face of failure, nor any set of fixed choices, will be sufficient for use in modern distributed applications. Emerald and other distributed languages have implicitly assumed that some fixed choice must be made, and as a result, distributed objects as a language construct have not yet gone mainstream. I believe distributed object languages have a future, but we must find a way to support a diverse set of connection and failure semantics within a language infrastructure. Some choices of semantics may also be incompatible with advanced features of languages such as Emerald; in particular, guaranteeing consistency and availability when migrating stateful objects is problematic.",

      "Abstract": "Abstract: This paper establishes a notion of message-safe programs as a natural intermediate point between dynamically typed and statically typed Dart programs. Unlike traditional static type checking, the type system in the Dart programming language is unsound by design. The rationale has been that this allows compile-time detection of likely errors and enables code completion in integrated development environments, without being restrictive on programmers. We show that, despite unsoundness, judicious use of type annotations can ensure useful properties of the runtime behavior of Dart programs. This supports evolution from a dynamically typed program to a strictly statically typed form. We present a formal model of Dart that elucidates how a core of the language and its standard type system works. This allows us to characterize message-safe programs and present a theorem stating that such programs will never cause \u2018message not understood\u2019 errors, which is generally not guaranteed for Dart programs that pass the standard type checker. The formal model has been expressed in Coq.",

      "Abstract": "Abstract: Often when programmers modify source code they intend to preserve some parts of the program behaviour. We propose a formal criterion by which to characterise the preserved part of the program behaviour. Two program versions are equivalent up to a set of affected objects A, if executions of the two versions correspond at each execution step when we do not consider the objects in A. We propose a sufficient condition for this criterion. It suffices to establish that traces of method calls and returns between A objects and other objects are equivalent. Examining the stack and heap at each execution step is not necessary. We give a proof of the sufficiency of this condition, much of which we have automatically verified using Dafny. We also discuss our experiences with Dafny and detail how some interesting parts of our Dafny proof work.",

      "Abstract": "Today\u2019s Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) emphasize a class-oriented view of object-oriented systems at design-time. Broadly speaking, popular IDEs such as Eclipse present to developers a hierarchy of classes, the Outline View, where classes are organized by packages.\nTo understand the objects in a system, developers have to either mentally visualize them, or run the system and use a debugger, then wade through a heap of concrete objects and examine specific instances. There are often too many specific instances. For many program comprehension tasks, specific instances may not matter. Instead, it may be useful to present to developers abstract objects that abstract away related instances.\nWe propose a novel Eclipse Perspective, the Runtime Perspective, that makes a global hierarchy of abstract objects a first-class view of an object-oriented system at design-time. The perspective mines this information into many small views that complement the existing views in the Java Development perspective: an Abstract Object Tree with a search feature to complement the Package Explorer, an Abstract Stack to complement the Call Hierarchy, and a Partial Object Graph to complement the class diagrams extracted by many existing plugins.",

      "Abstract": "Research on di\u000berential privacy is generally concerned with examining data sets that are static. Because the data sets do not change, every computation on them produces \\one-shot&quot; query results; the results do not change aside from random- ness introduced for privacy . There are many circumstances, however, where this model does not apply, or is simply in- feasible. Data streams are examples of non-static data sets where results may change as more data is streamed. Theo- retical support for di\u000berential privacy with data streams has been researched in the form of di\u000berentially private stream- ing algorithms. In this paper, we present a practical frame- work for which a non-expert can perform di\u000berentially pri- vate operations on data streams. The system is built as an extension to PINQ, a di\u000berentially private programming framework for static data sets. The streaming extension provides a programmatic interface for the di\u000berent types of streaming di\u000berential privacy from the literature so that the privacy trade-o\u000bs of each type of algorithm can be under- stood by a non-expert programmer.",

We discuss the issues and provide a sketch of how one could implement a system that proves (in many cases) or strongly veri es (in other cases) that a security patch xes a bug, and changes nothing else about the semantics of a program. We make use of an analysis of \\bug surfaces&quot; { the set of inputs that trigger a bug, to give a type theoretic characterization of the nonbuggy surface of a program. We thus give credence to the Langsec notion that security aws are often about input handling, and show how formal patch and bug analysis can be used to de ne a more correct input type for a program.",

And yet, the maker will have to learn a soup of software language and framework to build a connected IoC solution: C++ for the micro-controller code, HTML + javascript for the client, some backend language and a communication layer to interact with the devices. In this session, we will show an attempt at unifying the compilation of web server code, rich client and embedded firmware under a simple mobile friendly language and IDE.",

      "Abstract": "One of the most common security &amp; privacy issues concerning mobile applications is the unnecessary access to sensitive information and resources. In a mobile application platform like Android, where a permission mechanism is used to maintain access control, the app developer dictates what permissions are necessary at install time. For various reasons however, including user confusion and lack of proper documentation, developers may overcompensate for the necessary permissions, thus undermining the access control mechanism and increasing the potential risk from a vulnerability exploit. In this paper we present PermitMe, a tool developed as a plugin for the Eclipse IDE, to interactively guide developers on the set of required permissions when creating Android applications. We conducted a between-groups user study in order to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and usability of the PermitMe tool in enhancing the developer\u2019s experience when deciding on including Android permissions in their mobile applications.",

      "Abstract": "Web applications must ultimately command systems like web browsers and database engines using strings. Strings derived from improperly sanitized user input can thus be a vector for command injection attacks. In this paper, we introduce regular string types, which classify strings known statically to be in a specified regular language. These types come equipped with common operations like concatenation, substitution and coercion, so they can be used to implement, in a conventional manner, the portions of a web application or application framework that must directly construct com- mand strings. Simple type annotations at key interfaces can be used to statically verify that sanitization has been per- formed correctly without introducing redundant run-time checks. We specify this type system in a minimal typed lambda calculus, Î»RS. To be practical, adopting a specialized type system like this should not require the adoption of a new programming language. Instead, we advocate for extensible type systems: new type system fragments like this should be implemented as libraries atop a mechanism that guarantees that they can be safely composed. We support this with two contribu- tions. First, we specify a translation from Î»RS to a language fragment containing only standard strings and regular ex- pressions. Second, taking Python as a language with these constructs, we implement the type system together with the translation as a library using atlang, an extensible static type system for Python being developed by the authors.",

Anecdotal evidence suggests that some new developers create original natural language privacy policies, use existing privacy policies as templates or an external agency (i.e., a lawyer). This paper presents an overview of the privacy Policy Auto-Generation for Eclipse (PAGE), a work-in-progress that seeks to integrate privacy planning capabilities into the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE), enabling mobile application developers to create privacy policies as development occurs. This should support privacy by design concepts, enhance team communication through reusability, as well as reduce costs due to errors or extra time in external activities.",

      "Abstract": "With the rise of domain-specific languages, more people are designing languages than ever, but the art of language design is hard to master. In this talk, we make a case for adapting insights from formal semantics into design patterns and conceptual tools for language design. Semanticists have invested significant effort in developing these insights in the pursuit of mathematical elegance, indirectly providing us with a toolbox full of design tools that are simple and powerful. We will introduce a few of these design tools, illustrating how language designers can start applying insights from formal semantics right now, without being experts in the subject or incurring the overhead of formalizing their entire language. The design tools we present are just a starting point and we hope to inspire other language designers to adapt this utilitarian view of formal semantics, to help us reuse the effort and expertise of semanticists by adapting their insights into easily applied design tools.",

      "Abstract": "There are two main approaches to implementing domain-specific languages. With the standalone approach,independent tools such as compilers and run-time environments for the DSL are implemented in one or more general-purpose programming languages. With the embedded approach, the DSL implementation takes the form of a library of definitions in the host language, and a program in the DSL is merely a program in the host language that makes use of the library.\nAmongst embedded DSLs, there are two further refinements. With a deep embedding, terms in the DSL are implemented simply to construct an abstract syntax tree (AST), which is subsequently transformed for optimization and traversed for evaluation. With a shallow embedding, terms in the DSL are implemented directly by their semantics, bypassing the intermediate AST and its traversal. Deep embeddings might seem like the obvious approach, but Kamin and Erwig (among others) argue that shallow embeddings are superior.\nOur focus in this talk proposal is the relationship between deep and shallow embeddings of DSLs, and the connection to compositional semantics.",

      "Abstract": "Computer languages are used in different contexts, such as software development, release engineering, and performance engineering, and on different platforms like operation systems and integrated development environments (IDEs). These use cases and platforms have different characteristics and impose requirements on a language and its tooling. Developing a language and tooling that works in many contexts and platforms is hard, time consuming, and is not something that language engineers should be spending time on. Language workbenches alleviate a large part of this problem by providing IDE and command-line runtimes which run languages created with that language workbench. However, each language workbench has their own runtime system, resulting in a lot of duplicated effort and no easy way to interoperate between languages developed with different workbenches. A common core for language tools can serve as a library for language workbench runtime systems to prevent duplicated effort and support interoperability. We have inspected existing language workbenches and have ideas for a common architecture, but we have most likely not thought of everything. We think it will be an interesting topic for a discussion in the area of language tools.",

      "Abstract": "Empirical evaluations of programming environments have traditionally focused on human performance measures such as task efficiency, error rates, and learnability. In addition to these effectiveness measures, we believe there is good reason to consider the ability of programming environments to promote social interactions and awareness during programming tasks. Indeed, especially in educational contexts, programming success and persistence in the computing discipline have been positively correlated with programmers\u2019 sense of community and ability to communicate with others. We introduce social programming environments as a new breed of educational programming environment designed to promote social interaction and awareness, and we propose a way to evaluate such environments relative to social learning theory.",

      "Abstract": "Previous studies focus on the specific questions software engineers ask when evolving a codebase. Though these studies observe developers using statically typed languages, little is known about the developer questions using dynamically typed languages. Dynamically typed languages present new challenges to understanding and navigating in a codebase and could affect results reported by previous studies.\nThis paper replicates a previous study and presents the analysis of six programming sessions made in Pharo, a dynamically typed language. We found a similar result when comparing sessions on an unfamiliar codebase with the previous work. Our result on the familiar code greatly deviates from the replicated study, likely caused by different tasks and development strategies. Both missing type information and test driven development affected participant behavior and prudence on codebase understanding, where some participants made changes based on assumptions.\nWe provide a set of questions that are useful in characterizing activity related to the use of a dynamically typed language and test-driven development\u2014questions not explicitly considered in previous research. We also present a number of issues that we would like to discuss during the PLATEAU workshop.",

We investigate how two program analysis tools are used by developers at Google: ThreadSafety, an annotation-based static data race analysis, and TSan, a dynamic data race detector. The data was collected by interviewing seven veteran industry developers at Google, and provides unique insight into how four different teams use tooling in different ways to help with multithreaded programming. The result is a collection of perceived pros and cons of using ThreadSafety and TSan, as well as general issues with multithreading.",

      "Abstract": "Researchers have paid increasing attention in recent years to the fact that much development occurs though example modification. Helping programmers with some of the pitfalls and vagaries of working with example code is the goal of our tool, called Euklas. It helps developers to integrate JavaScript example code into their own projects by using familiar IDE interaction techniques of the Eclipse IDE. The Euklas plugin uses static, heuristic source code checks to highlight potential errors and to recommend potential fixes, when incomplete sections of code are copied from a working JavaScript example and pasted into the program being edited. The most unique feature of the tool is the ability to automatically import missing variable and function definitions from an example file into a new project file. Our preliminary user study of Euklas suggests that it supports users in fixing errors more easily.",

The software engineering domain is entertained by a diversity of rich integrated development environments (IDEs) that aim at simplifying the tasks and reducing the efforts of a programmer. Other domains are unfortunately not as cherished. In this paper, we survey twenty-five visual IDEs used in non-programming domains and evaluate how usable and fit they are for their domain. The goal of this research is to determine what features are needed in different domains and how they should be presented to the domain user.",

      "Abstract": "Static types may be used both by the language implementation and directly by the user as documentation. Though much existing work focuses primarily on the implications of static types on the semantics of programs, relatively little work considers the impact on usability that static types pro- vide. Though the omission of static type information may decrease program length and thereby improve readability, it may also decrease readability because users must then frequently derive type information manually while reading programs. As type inference becomes more popular in languages that are in widespread use, it is important to consider whether the adoption of type inference may impact productivity of developers.",

      "Abstract": "Plaid is a research programming language with a focus on typestate, permissions, and concurrency. Typestate describes ordering constraints on method calls to an object; Plaid incorporates typestate into both its object model and its type system. Permissions, incorporated into Plaid\u2019s type system and runtime, describe whether a reference can be aliased and whether aliases can change that reference. Permissions support static typestate checking, but they also allow Plaid\u2019s compiler to automatically parallelize Plaid code. In this paper, we describe the usability-related hypotheses that drove the design of Plaid. We describe the evidence, both informal and scientific, that inspired and (in some cases) validated these hypotheses, and reflect on our experience designing and validating the language.",

      "Abstract": "Breaches of software security affect millions of people, and therefore it is crucial to strive for more secure software systems. However, the effect of programming language design on software security is not easily measured or studied. In the absence of scientific insight, opinions range from those that claim that programming language design has no effect on security of the system, to those that believe that programming language design is the only way to provide \u201chigh-assurance software.\u201d In this paper, we discuss how programming language design can impact software security by looking at a specific example: the Wyvern programming language. We report on how the design of the Wyvern programming language leverages security principles, together with hypotheses about how usability impacts security, in order to prevent command injection attacks. Furthermore, we discuss what security principles we considered in Wyvern\u2019s design.",

      "Abstract": "Visual programming environments hold great potential for end-user programming, as they, e.g., aim at diminishing the syntactical burden and enabling a focus on the semantic aspects of coding. Hence, graphical approaches have gained attention in the context of K-12 computer science education. Scratch, as being the prime example, is a visual educational language, where even formulas are composed utilizing Lego-style blocks. However, graphical creation and manipulation of complex and nested formulas can become overly cumbersome. Thus, we propose a hybrid approach employing visual creation and textual representation of formulas. In order to evaluate the method, a usability study has been conducted, comparing Scratch to our mobile programming environment, Pocket Code. The findings, while preliminary, indicate an increased efficiency and effectiveness of the hybrid approach employed in Pocket Code in contrast to a purely visual one in Scratch for teenager users.",

      "Abstract": "The increase in the importance of Computational Science software motivates the need to identify and understand which software engineering (SE) practices are appropriate. Because of the uniqueness of the computational science domain, exiting SE tools and techniques developed for the business/IT community are often not efficient or effective. Appropriate SE solutions must account for the salient characteristics of the computational science development environment. To identify these solutions, members of the SE community must interact with members of the computational science community. This presentation will discuss the findings from a series of case studies of CSE projects and the results of an ongoing workshop series. First, a series of case studies of computational science projects were conducted as part of the DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems (HPCS) project. The main goal of these studies was to understand how SE principles were and were not being applied in computational science along with some of the reasons why. The studies resulted in nine lessons learned about computational science software that are important to consider moving forward. Second, the Software Engineering for Computational Science and Engineering workshop brings together software engineers and computational scientists. The outcomes of this workshop series provide interesting insight into potential future trends.",

      "Abstract": "Developers of concurrent software strive for two contradictory goals. On the one hand, the software should be reliable, which requires to carefully synchronize concurrent accesses to shared data. On the other hand, the software should be efficient, which is difficult to realize in the presence of unnecessary synchronization operations. To help developers balance these two goals, this talk explores program analyses that detect correctness and performance problems. The presented analyses are automatic, in the sense that they run on existing software with minimal effort, and precise, in the sense that all reported problems are true positives. The key idea is to combine techniques for generating concurrent tests with dynamic analyses that detect problems even though there is no explicit specification. We present two implementations of this idea that detect problems in widely used thread-safe classes, and discuss open challenges to be addressed in future research.",

      "Abstract": "The major difficulty of traditional approaches to writing parallel software stems from their serial heritage. Typical serial programs are over-constraint in the sense that they make decisions that are semantically unnecessary. At the same time they do not explicitly express the information that\u2019s needed to deduce a correct parallel program execution. The programmer is left alone with the painful task of separating what in the given serial execution ordering is semantically required and what is only a serialization artefact. A more productive approach is to let the programmer explicitly identify what precludes parallel execution in the application and leave out all others. There are exactly two reasons that computations cannot execute in parallel. If one computation produces data that the other one consumes, the producer must execute before the consumer. If one computation determines if another will execute, the controller must execute before the controllee. CnC lets you define exactly these two types of dependences between computations. With this information a programmer, a compiler or a runtime system can then take care of a correct serial or parallel execution. Its high-level but yet precise formulation allows an extensive separation of semantic concerns and tuning concerns such as parallelization. This makes optimizations for a given platform as well as migrating between different targets simpler. Last but not least a CnC specification puts no artificial limits on the parallelization and so allows fully asynchronous execution, not even requiring barriers between modules.",

      "Abstract": "While many mobile device applications are backed by cloud servers and storage, the current programming technology is tedious and potentially error prone. Developing individual application parts is not difficult, but developing an entire system is far more challenging and there\u2019s currently no way to map user-level application code to the computational resources available in a flexible way. In this invited talk, Agha talks about a new methodology for building mobile cloud applications that can leverage cloud resources in a scalable way, while dramatically simplifying the development effort. This is the subject of the NSF-funded project entitled \u201cModel-based, Event-Driven Scalable Programming for the Mobile Cloud,\u201d lead by Agha along with Illinois computer science professor Darko Marinov, in collaboration with Daniel Jackson at MIT. The project aims to develop a high-end interface language that\u2019s simple for programmers, while back-end programming could still be done using an actors model, which is optimal for scaling and was developed by Agha in 1985. This will make it easier to program web applications without compromising their efficiency and scalability in execution, using the actors model.",

      "Abstract": "Software development involves stitching existing components together. These data/service components are usually not well-understood, as they are made by others and often obtained from somewhere on the Internet. This makes software development a daunting challenge, requiring programmers to manually discover the resources they need, understand their capabilities, adapt these resources to their needs, and update the system as external components change.\nSoftware engineers have long realized the problem why automation seems impossible: the lack of semantic \u201cunderstanding\u201d on the part of the machine about those components. A multitude of solutions have been proposed under the umbrella term \u201cSemantic Web\u201d (SW), in which semantic \u201cmarkup\u201d of the components with concepts from semantic ontologies and the ability to invoke queries over those concepts enables a form of automated discovery and mediation among software services.\nOn the other hand, programming languages rarely provide mechanisms for anchoring objects/data to real-world concepts. Inspired by the aspirations of SW, in this paper we reformulate its visions from the perspective of a programming model, i.e., that components themselves should be able to interact using semantic ontologies, rather than having a separate markup language and composition platform. In the vision, a rich specification language and common sense knowledge base over real-world concepts serves as a \u201clingua franca\u201d to describe software components. Components can query the system to automatically (1) discover other components that provide needed functionality/ data (2) discover the appropriate API within that component in order to obtain what is intended, and even (3) implicitly interpret the provided data in the desired form independent of the form originally presented by the provider component.\nBy demonstrating a successful case of realization of this vision on a microexample, we hope to show how a programming languages (PL) approach to SW can be superior to existing engineered solutions, since the generality and expressiveness in the language can be harnessed, and encourage PL researchers to jump on the SW bandwagon.",

      "Abstract": "Programmers working in a Unix environment can easily build custom tools by configuring and combining small filter programs in shell scripts. When leaving the text-based world and entering the graphics-based one, however, tool building is more difficult because graphical tools are typically not prepared to be easily re-programmed by its users. We propose a data-driven perspective on graphical tools that uses concise scripts as glue between data and views but also as means to express missing data transformations and view items. Given this, we built a framework in Squeak/Smalltalk that promotes low-effort tool construction; it works well for basic programming tools, such as code editors and debuggers, but also for other domains, such as developer chats and issue browsers. We think that this perspective on graphical tools can inspire the creation of new trade-offs in modularity for both data-providing projects and interactive views.",

      "Abstract": "Phrase-based statistical machine translation approaches have been highly successful in translating between natural languages and are heavily used by commercial systems (e.g. Google Translate).\nThe main objective of this work is to investigate the applicability of these approaches for translating between programming languages. Towards that, we investigated several variants of the phrase-based translation approach: i) a direct application of the approach to programming languages, ii) a novel modification of the approach to incorporate the grammatical structure of the target programming language (so to avoid generating target programs which do not parse), and iii) combines ii) with custom rules added to improve the quality of the translation.\nTo experiment with the above systems, we investigated machine translation from C# to Java. For the training, which takes about 60 hours, we used a parallel corpus of 20,499 C#-to-Java method translations. We then evaluated each of the three systems above by translating 1,000 C# methods. Our experimental results indicate that with the most advanced system, about 60% of the translated methods compile (the top ranked) and out of a random sample of 50 correctly compiled methods, 68% (34 methods) were semantically equivalent to the reference solution.",

Whoever you are \u2013 a developer or a user of a DSL \u2013 you usually have to choose your side; you should not! What about metamorphic DSLs that change their shape according to your needs? \nWe report on our 4-years journey of providing the \u201cright\u201d support (in the domain of feature modeling), leading us to develop an external DSL, different shapes of an internal API, and maintain all these languages. A key insight is that there is no one-size-fits-all solution or no clear superiority of a solution compared to another. On the contrary, we found that it does make sense to continue the maintenance of an external and internal DSL. \nThe vision that we foresee for the future of software languages is their ability to be self-adaptable to the most appropriate shape (including the corresponding integrated development environment) according to a particular usage or task. We call metamorphic DSL such a language, able to change from one shape to another shape.",

      "Abstract": "Tierless programming languages enable developing the typical server, client and database tiers of a web application as a single mono-linguistic program.This development style is in stark contrast to the current practice which requires combining multiple technologies and programming languages. A myriad of tierless programming languages has already been proposed, often featuring a JavaScript-like syntax. Instead of introducing yet another, we advocate that it should be possible to develop tierless web applications in existing general-purpose languages. This not only reduces the complexity that developers are exposed to, but also precludes the need for new development tools. We concretize this novel approach to tierless programming by discussing requirements on its future instantiations. We explore the design space of the program analysis for determining and the program transformation for realizing the tier split respectively. The former corresponds to new adaptations of an old familiar, program slicing, for tier splitting. The latter includes several strategies for handling cross-tier function calls and data accesses. Using a prototype instantiation for JavaScript, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on an example web application. We conclude with a discussion of open questions and challenges for future research.",

      "Abstract": "Variation is everywhere, but in the construction and analysis of customizable software it is paramount. In this context, there arises a need for variational data structures for efficiently representing and computing with related variants of an underlying data type. So far, variational data structures have been explored and developed ad hoc. This paper is a first attempt and a call to action for systematic and foundational research in this area. Research on variational data structures will benefit not only customizable software, but the many other application domains that must cope with variability. In this paper, we show how support for variation can be understood as a general and orthogonal property of data types, data structures, and algorithms. We begin a systematic exploration of basic variational data structures, exploring the tradeoffs between different implementations. Finally, we retrospectively analyze the design decisions in our own previous work where we have independently encountered problems requiring variational data structures.",

We propose a framework relying on ScanVis, an extension of the Semiology of Graphics that models the perception and scanning of abstract graphics, to model and to provide plausible explanations of phenomena pertaining to the visual perception of representations of code. This framework unifies many aspects of the visual layout and appearance of programming languages and reveals similarities and substantial differences in the visual operations required by those notations. We also show how the framework may help compare and generate representations of programming languages with respect to visual perception. This work suggests that the gap between textual and graphical languages is narrow, and that all kind of programming languages should rely on the capability of the human visual system.",

      "Abstract": "Humans are amazing at processing information. This ability has enabled humans to create software development projects that comprise a tremendous amount of information of various forms from predominantly natural language documents like requirements to blended natural language and structured artifacts like issues to predominantly structured source and test code. So much information is generated daily in a software product that it exceeds the ability of humans to find and process all of the information that may be useful or critical for decisions that must be made. The majority of tools used in practice to access information do not help as they are predominantly aimed at returning complete information rather than just what is needed to complete a task-at-hand. In this paper, I outline the situation facing most developers today and outline new tool interaction styles that are emerging that can help address this problem and keep a software developer in the flow of a task. By improving flow, I argue that we can enable developers (and eventually a broader set of knowledge workers) to work smarter, work better and have more fun.",

      "Abstract": "Korz is a new computational model that provides for context-oriented programming by combining implicit arguments and multiple dispatch in a slot-based model. This synthesis enables the writing of software that supports contextual variation along multiple dimensions, and graceful evolution of that software to support new, unexpected dimensions of variability, without the need for additional mechanism such as layers or aspects. With Korz, a system consists of a sea of method and data slots in a multidimensional space. There is no fixed organization of slots into objects \u2013 a slot pertains to a number of objects instead of being contained by a single object \u2013 and slots can come together according to the implicit context in any given situation, yielding subjective objects. There is no dominant decomposition, and no dimension holds sway over any other. IDE support is essential for managing complexity when working with the slot space and with subjectivity, allowing the task at hand to dictate what subspaces to isolate and what dominance of dimensions to use when presenting nested views to the user. We have implemented a prototype interpreter and IDE, and used it on several examples. This early experience has revealed much that needs to be done, but has also shown considerable promise. It seems that Korz\u2019s particular combination of concepts, each well-known from the past, is indeed more powerful than the sum of its parts.",

      "Abstract": "Programming languages and coding standards provide invariants to ease reasoning about the correctness of code. Although useful, invariants are often intentionally broken by programmers for performance or compatibility purposes. An operation that consists of multiple steps can preserve an invariant overall even though it breaks it temporarily during the process\u2014e.g., inserting a node into a doubly linked list takes two operations between which the list is ill-formed. It is important that intermediate states of these operations are not observable by the rest of the program. We explore various devices that are used to bundle together the different steps of such an operation in a way that hides intermediate states\u2014bringing some form of atomicity. However, while all these constructs might work in a certain context there is no way to ensure they still work for extensions and new versions of the programming language, the underlying operating system, the linked libraries, or even the processor architecture.

      "Abstract": "The development of robust and efficient interactive web applications is challenging, because developers have to deal with multiple programming languages, asynchronous events, propagating data and events between clients and servers, data consistency and much more. Several approaches for (partly) addressing these challenges have been proposed. Two important ones are (1) multi-tier languages and (2) functional reactive programming (FRP). Multi-tier programming languages support the development of client and server in a single language, and hide much of the complexity related to distribution. FRP offers the right abstractions to make event-driven programming convenient, safe and composable. The existence of mature and widely used implementations of both these approaches is evidence of their usefulness. However, existing web frameworks and programming languages exploit the benefits of both approaches separately, for example by restricting the use of FRP to the client side.\nWe propose multi-tier FRP for the Web, a novel approach to writing web applications that deeply integrates FRP and multi-tier languages, and where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. In multi-tier FRP, the developer programs server and client together as an FRP application composed of behaviors (signals) and events. He/she chooses explicitly where the boundary between server and client is crossed. To make our approach more concrete and provide evidence of its potential, this paper presents a concrete design and implementation of a multi-tier FRP API for the web in the programming language Scala, using an embedded JavaScript DSL that makes Scala usable as a multi-tier language. This allows us to present initial evidence of the benefits of the multi-tier FRP approach on example applications, and to experiment with possible answers to the remaining questions. Concretely, we show possible solutions for problems like exposing client identity on the server and efficiently pre-loading clients with the latest application state. Our results show that multi-tier FRP is a promising, declarative, yet practical way of writing web applications.",

      "Abstract": "Time is of the essence when modifying state. Most programming languages expose the hardware\u2019s ability to update global state at any time, leaving the burden entirely on programmers to properly order all updates. Just as languages now manage memory to free us from meticulously allocating and freeing memory, languages should also manage time to take care of properly ordering state updates. We propose time management as a general language feature to relate various prior work but also to guide future research of this largely unexplored design space.\nWe propose a new form of managed time, Glitch, which ensures that all updates associated with an external event appear to execute simultaneously, removing the need to order execution manually. Glitch replays code as needed to reach an appearance of simultaneous execution. To do this, all updates must be commutative and capable of being rolled back, which is ensured through built-in state constructs and runtime monitoring. While these restrictions might seem onerous, we find them acceptable for many realistic programs. Glitch retains the familiar imperative programming model as much as possible, restricting rather than replacing it.\nManaged time also aides in live programming that provides immediate programmer feedback on how code edits affect execution. Live programming to date has been limited to special cases like pure functions, spreadsheets, or at the top level of games and graphics. Glitch is fully live: past program executions can be replayed in an IDE, while executions are incrementally revised under arbitrary code changes.",

      "Abstract": "The concept of \u201ctype\u201d has been used without a precise definition in discussions about programming languages for 60 years. The set of people with a technical interest in programming languages is a broad one, and although many distinct, precise definitions have been used consistently within distinct subsets, I have long harboured a sense that discourse between such groups is unnecessarily strained by the cross purposes which arise in discussions mentioning the word \u201ctype\u201d. In this essay I explore this matter from both a personal perspective and a historical one. I argue that two essential notions of \u201ctype\u201d arose independently \u2013 one from programming traditions and the other from symbolic logic traditions \u2013 and despite a prevailing presumption to the contrary (on both sides), they have never been explicitly unified in the literature. I\u2019ll also argue that having recognised the distinction, it might be more profitable to leave them unreconciled and distinct, owing to some fundamental differences in nature between mathematical truths and \u201ceconomic truths\u201d. Nevertheless, I argue that trending developments in both the theory and practice of programming make it important to resolve our differences, and offer some personal thoughts about how to do so.",

      "Abstract": "Dynamically typed languages lack information about the types of variables in the source code. Developers care about this informa- tion as it supports program comprehension. Basic type inference techniques are helpful, but may yield many false positives or nega- tives. We propose to mine information from the software ecosystem on how frequently given types are inferred unambiguously to im- prove the quality of type inference for a single system. This paper presents an approach to augment existing type infer- ence techniques by supplementing the information available in the source code of a project with data from other projects written in the same language. For all available projects, we track how often messages are sent to instance variables throughout the source code. Then, predictions for the type of a variable are made based on the messages sent to it. The evaluation of a proof-of-concept prototype shows that this approach works well for types that are sufficiently popular, like those found in the standard libraries, and tends to create false positives for unpopular or domain specific types. The false positives are, in most cases, fairly easily identifiable. Also, the evaluation data shows a substantial increase in the number of correctly inferred types when compared to the non-augmented type inference.",

In this paper, we express doubts that the programming language community is focused on the most crucial problems in programming language design.

      "Abstract": "Everyone wants to know one thing about a test suite: will it detect enough bugs? Unfortunately, in most settings that matter, answering this question directly is impractical or impossible. Software engineers and researchers therefore tend to rely on various measures of code coverage (where mutation testing is considered as a form of syntactic coverage). A long line of academic research efforts have attempted to determine whether relying on coverage as a substitute for fault detection is a reasonable solution to the problems of test suite evaluation. This essay argues that the profusion of coverage-related literature is in part a sign of an underlying uncertainty as to what exactly it is that measuring coverage should achieve, and how we would know if it can, in fact, achieve it. We propose some solutions, but the primary focus is to clarify the state of current confusions regarding this key problem for effective software testing.",

It uses our framework that allows tree rewriting during AST interpretation.

When the tree reaches a stable state, partial evaluation compiles the tree into optimized machine code. The partial evaluation is done by Graal, the just-in-time compiler of our version of the Java HotSpot VM.\nOracle Labs as well as external research groups have implemented a variety of programming languages on top of Truffle, including JavaScript, Ruby, R, Python, and Smalltalk. They are competitive with or even faster than the best implementations that existed before.\nThis tutorial is both for newcomers and existing users of Truffle. We introduce the basic concepts of Truffle and show you how to get started with your own high-performance language implementation.

      "Abstract": "Parsers are ubiquitous in computing: many applications de- pend on fast decoding of data. Parser combinators are an in- tuitive tool for writing parsers: tight integration with the host language enables grammar specifications to be interleaved with processing of parse results. Unfortunately, parser com- binators are slow due to the high overhead on the abstraction mechanisms that enable composition. We present a technique for eliminating such overhead. We use staging, a form of runtime code generation, to dissoci- ate input parsing from parser composition, and eliminate in- termediate data structures and computations associated with parser composition at staging time. A key challenge is to maintain support for input dependent grammars, which have no clear stage distinction. Our approach applies to top-down recursive-descent parsers as well as bottom-up nondeterministic parsers with key applications in dynamic programming on sequences, where we auto-generate code for parallel hardware. We achieve performance comparable to specialized, hand-written parsers.",

      "Abstract": "An incremental computation updates its result based on a change to its input, which is often an order of magnitude faster than a recomputation from scratch. In particular, incrementalization can make expensive computations feasible for settings that require short feedback cycles, such as interactive systems, IDEs, or (soft) real-time systems.\nThis paper presents i3QL, a general-purpose programming language for specifying incremental computations. i3QL provides a declarative SQL-like syntax and is based on incremental versions of operators from relational algebra, enriched with support for general recursion. We integrated i3QL into Scala as a library, which enables programmers to use regular Scala code for non-incremental subcomputations of an i3QL query and to easily integrate incremental computations into larger software projects. To improve performance, i3QL optimizes user-defined queries by applying algebraic laws and partial evaluation. We describe the design and implementation of i3QL and its optimizations, demonstrate its applicability, and evaluate its performance.",

      "Abstract": "Programs often consist of parts that are written in different languages either because sub-problems lend themselves to being implemented in a particular language or because code in a specific language needs to be reused. However, multi-language programs often suffer from poor performance, complex cross-language interfaces, or insufficient flexibility. We propose a novel approach for composing multiple language implementations in a seamless way. It blurs the language borders by allowing foreign objects of one language to be used like regular objects in another language. Our interoperability mechanism targets language implementations that run on the same VM and have the same style of intermediate representation (IR), e.g., an abstract syntax tree (AST). For accessing foreign objects we generate foreign-language-specific IR patterns that we insert into the IR of the host application. Thus we avoid converting or marshalling foreign objects at the language border. A foreign object access is therefore as fast as it would be in the object\u2019s language of origin. Our mechanism also allows the just-in-time compiler of the host VM to inline and optimize across language borders.",

      "Abstract": "Emerging approximate hardware platforms provide operations that, in return for reduced energy consumption, may occasionally produce an incorrect result. We present and evaluate Chisel, a system for reliability-aware optimization of approximate computational kernels that run on such approximate hardware platforms. Given a reliability specification, which identifies a lower bound on the reliability of the result that the kernel computation produces, Chisel automatically determines which kernel operations may execute unreliably and which must execute reliably for the kernel to satisfy its reliability specification.\nWe evaluate Chisel on five applications from the image processing, scientific computing, and financial analysis domains. The experimental results show that our implemented optimization algorithm enables Chisel to successfully optimize our set of benchmark kernels to obtain energy savings from 8.7% to 19.8% compared to the fully reliable kernel implementations while preserving important reliability guarantees.",

      "Abstract": "We describe a new algorithm SPLITMIX for an object-oriented and splittable pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) that is quite fast: 9 64-bit arithmetic/logical operations per 64 bits generated. A conventional linear PRNG object provides a generate method that returns one pseudorandom value and updates the state of the PRNG, but a splittable PRNG object also has a second operation, split, that replaces the original PRNG object with two (seemingly) independent PRNG objects, by creating and returning a new such object and updating the state of the original object. Splittable PRNG objects make it easy to organize the use of pseudorandom numbers in multithreaded programs structured using fork-join parallelism. No locking or synchronization is required (other than the usual memory fence immediately after object creation). Because the generate method has no loops or conditionals, it is suitable for SIMD or GPU implementation.\nWe derive SPLITMIX from the DOTMIX algorithm of Leiserson, Schardl, and Sukha by making a series of program transformations and engineering improvements. The end result is an object-oriented version of the purely functional API used in the Haskell library for over a decade, but SPLITMIX is faster and produces pseudorandom sequences of higher quality; it is also far superior in quality and speed to java.util.Random, and has been included in Java JDK8 as the class java.util.SplittableRandom. \nWe have tested the pseudorandom sequences produced by SPLITMIX using two standard statistical test suites (DieHarder and TestU01) and they appear to be adequate for \u201ceveryday\u201d use, such as in Monte Carlo algorithms and randomized data structures where speed is important.",

      "Abstract": "Surveys can be viewed as programs, complete with logic, control flow, and bugs. Word choice or the order in which questions are asked can unintentionally bias responses. Vague, confusing, or intrusive questions can cause respondents to abandon a survey. Surveys can also have runtime errors: inattentive respondents can taint results. This effect is especially problematic when deploying surveys in uncontrolled settings, such as on the web or via crowdsourcing platforms. Because the results of surveys drive business decisions and inform scientific conclusions, it is crucial to make sure they are correct.\nWe present SurveyMan, a system for designing, deploying, and automatically debugging surveys. Survey authors write their surveys in a lightweight domain-specific language aimed at end users. SurveyMan statically analyzes the survey to provide feedback to survey authors before deployment. It then compiles the survey into JavaScript and deploys it either to the web or a crowdsourcing platform. SurveyMan\u2019s dynamic analyses automatically find survey bugs, and control for the quality of responses. We evaluate SurveyMan\u2019s algorithms analytically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness with case studies of social science surveys conducted via Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk.",

      "Abstract": "Garbage collectors for managed languages are exact or conservative. An exact collector identifies references precisely and may move referents and update references. A conservative collector is constrained by ambiguous references in two ways. (1) Since they may be pointers, the collectors must retain referents. (2) Since they may be values, the collectors cannot modify them, pinning their referents. This paper is the first to show that retaining dead objects and pinning objects affects remarkably few heap objects: for Java benchmarks, &lt; 0.01% are falsely retained and 0.03% are pinned. \nThe larger effect is collector design. Prior conservative collectors either (1) use mark-sweep and forgo moving all objects, or (2) use mostly copying and pin entire pages. This paper shows this overhead is substantial: 12% and 45% respectively, compared to generational collection in a Java VM. We introduce high performance conservative Immix and reference counting (RC). Immix is a mark-region collector that combines fine line-grain pinning and opportunistic copying of unambiguous referents. Deferred RC simply needs an object map to deliver the first conservative RC in the literature. We implement six exact collectors and their conservative counterparts. Conservative Immix variants and RC come within 2 to 3% of their exact counterparts. In particular, conservative RC Immix is slightly faster than a well-tuned exact generational collector. For managed languages, these findings show conservative collection is compatible with high performance.",

We present a novel reduction scheme for asynchronous event-driven programs that finds almost-synchronous invariants \u2013 invariants consisting of global states where message buffers are close to empty. The reduction finds almost-synchronous invariants and simultaneously argues that they cover all local states. We show that asynchronous programs often have almost-synchronous invariants and that we can exploit this to build natural proofs that they are correct. We implement our reduction strategy and show that it is more effective in proving programs correct as well as more efficient in finding bugs in several programs, compared to current search strategies which almost always diverge. The high point of our experiments show that our technique can prove the Windows Phone USB Driver written in P correct for the receptiveness property, which was hitherto not provable using state-of-the-art model-checkers.",

      "Abstract": "Non-volatile main memory, such as memristors or phase change memory, can revolutionize the way programs persist data. In-memory objects can themselves be persistent without the need for a separate persistent data storage format. However, the challenge is to ensure that such data remains consistent if a failure occurs during execution.\nIn this paper, we present our system, called Atlas, which adds durability semantics to lock-based code, typically allowing us to automatically maintain a globally consistent state even in the presence of failures. We identify failure-atomic sections of code based on existing critical sections and describe a log-based implementation that can be used to recover a consistent state after a failure. We discuss several subtle semantic issues and implementation tradeoffs. We confirm the ability to rapidly flush caches as a core implementation bottleneck and suggest partial solutions. Experimental results confirm the practicality of our approach and provide insight into the overheads of such a system.",

      "Abstract": "Developers who set a breakpoint a few statements too late or who are trying to diagnose a subtle bug from a single core dump often wish for a time-traveling debugger. The ability to rewind time to see the exact sequence of statements and program values leading to an error has great intuitive appeal but, due to large time and space overheads, time-traveling debuggers have seen limited adoption.\nA managed runtime, such as the Java JVM or a JavaScript engine, has already paid much of the cost of providing core features \u2014 type safety, memory management, and virtual IO \u2014 that can be reused to implement a low overhead time-traveling debugger. We leverage this insight to design and build affordable time-traveling debuggers for managed languages. Tardis realizes our design: it provides affordable time-travel with an average overhead of only 7% during normal execution, a rate of 0.6 MB/s of history logging, and a worst-case 0.68s time-travel latency on our benchmark applications. Tardis can also debug optimized code using time-travel to reconstruct state. This capability, coupled with its low overhead, makes Tardis suitable for use as the default debugger for managed languages, promising to bring time-traveling debugging into the mainstream and transform the practice of debugging.",

      "Abstract": "Static analysis for JavaScript can potentially help programmers find errors early during development. Although much progress has been made on analysis techniques, a major obstacle is the prevalence of libraries, in particular jQuery, which apply programming patterns that have detrimental consequences on the analysis precision and performance.\nPrevious work on dynamic determinacy analysis has demonstrated how information about program expressions that always resolve to a fixed value in some call context may lead to significant scalability improvements of static analysis for such code. We present a static dataflow analysis for JavaScript that infers and exploits determinacy information on-the-fly, to enable analysis of some of the most complex parts of jQuery. The analysis combines selective context and path sensitivity, constant propagation, and branch pruning, based on a systematic investigation of the main causes of analysis imprecision when using a more basic analysis.\nThe techniques are implemented in the TAJS analysis tool and evaluated on a collection of small programs that use jQuery. Our results show that the proposed analysis techniques boost both precision and performance, specifically for inferring type information and call graphs.",

      "Abstract": "We describe an algorithm to perform symbolic execution of a multithreaded program starting from an arbitrary program context. We argue that this can enable more efficient symbolic exploration of deep code paths in multithreaded programs by allowing the symbolic engine to jump directly to program contexts of interest.\nThe key challenge is modeling the initial context with reasonable precision\u2014an overly approximate model leads to exploration of many infeasible paths during symbolic execution, while a very precise model would be so expensive to compute that computing it would defeat the purpose of jumping directly to the initial context in the first place. We propose a \\emph{context-specific dataflow analysis} that approximates the initial context cheaply, but precisely enough to avoid some common causes of infeasible-path explosion. This model is necessarily approximate\u2014it may leave portions of the memory state unconstrained, leaving our symbolic execution unable to answer simple questions such as ``which thread holds lock A?\u2019\u2019. For such cases, we describe a novel algorithm for evaluating \\emph{symbolic synchronization} during symbolic execution. Our symbolic execution semantics are sound and complete up to the limits of the underlying SMT solver. We describe initial experiments on an implementation in Cloud9.",

      "Abstract": "Function versioning is an approach to addressing input-sensitivity of program optimizations. A major side effect of it is notable code size increase, which has been hindering its broad applications to large code bases and space-stringent environments. In this paper, we initiate a systematic exploration into the problem, providing answers to some fundamental questions: Given a space constraint, to which function we should apply versioning? How many versions of a function should we include in the final executable? Is the optimal selection feasible to do in polynomial time? This study proves selecting the best set of versions under a space constraint is NP-complete and proposes a heuristic algorithm named CHoGS which yields near optimal results in quadratic time. We implement the algorithm and conduct experiments through the IBM XL compilers. We observe significant performance enhancement with only slight code size increase; the results from CHoGS show factors of higher space efficiency than those from traditional hotness-based methods.",

      "Abstract": "Several program analysis tools\u2014such as plagiarism detection and bug finding\u2014rely on knowing a piece of code\u2019s relative semantic importance. For example, a plagiarism detector should not bother reporting two programs that have an identical simple loop counter test, but should report programs that share more distinctive code. Traditional program analysis techniques (e.g., finding data and control dependencies) are useful, but do not say how surprising or common a line of code is. Natural language processing researchers have encountered a similar problem and addressed it using an n-gram model of text frequency, derived from statistics computed over text corpora.\nWe propose and compute an n-gram model for programming languages, computed over a corpus of 2.8 million JavaScript programs we downloaded from the Web. In contrast to previous techniques, we describe a code n-gram as a subgraph of the program dependence graph that contains all nodes and edges reachable in n steps from the statement. We can count n-grams in a program and count the frequency of n-grams in the corpus, enabling us to compute tf-idf-style measures that capture the differing importance of different lines of code. We demonstrate the power of this approach by implementing a plagiarism detector with accuracy that beats previous techniques, and a bug-finding tool that discovered over a dozen previously unknown bugs in a collection of real deployed programs.",

      "Abstract": "During the software maintenance and evolution phase, the majority of a developer\u2019s time is spent on programming comprehension tasks. Feature location (i.e., finding the first location to make a modification), impact analysis (i.e., determining what and to what extent a program is affected by a change), and traceability (i.e., determining where requirements are implemented in the program), are all examples of such tasks. Recent research in the area of program comprehension has focused on using textual information, structural information (i.e., information regarding the creation and use of objects and methods within the code), and execution traces to develop tools that ease the burden on developers and decrease the time spent in each task. Furthermore, new studies in automating these tasks have started using text retrieval techniques, such as the vector space model (VSM), latent semantic indexing (LSI), and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for searching software. This doctoral symposium summary presents two promising areas for improving existing techniques by combining structural information with text retrieval. The first is a methodology for evaluating the usefulness of text obtained from a program by looking at the structural location of terms (e.g., method name, comments, identifiers). The second focuses on improving the existing text retrieval approaches by providing more flexible queries (i.e., search strings). These two areas are complementary to each other and may be combined.",

      "Abstract": "Designing and implementing thread-safe multithreaded libraries can be a daunting task as developers of these libraries need to ensure that their implementations are free from concurrency bugs including deadlocks. The usual practice involves employing software testing and/or dynamic analysis to detect deadlocks. Their effectiveness is dependent on well-designed multithreaded test cases. Unsurprisingly, developing multithreaded tests is easily an order of magnitude harder than developing single threaded tests for obvious reasons.\nIn this paper, we address the problem of automatically synthesizing multithreaded tests that can induce deadlocks. The key insight to our approach is that a subset of the properties observed when a deadlock manifests in a concurrent execution can also be observed in a single threaded execution. We design a novel, automatic, scalable and directed approach that identifies these properties and synthesizes a multithreaded test that realizes these properties simultaneously revealing a potential deadlock. The input to our approach is only the library implementation under consideration and the output is a set of deadlock revealing multithreaded tests.\nWe have implemented our approach as part of our tool, named OMEN, and applied it on many multithreaded Java libraries. OMEN synthesizes multithreaded tests for all these libraries that include classes that are documented as thread-safe in COLT (a popular high performance scientific computing library) where it enables detection of 35 real deadlocks. Moreover, our experimental results show that randomized approaches for detecting deadlocks are ineffective. We also conducted a user study and found that software testing/dynamic analysis on multithreaded tests developed by the participants did not reveal any deadlocks either. Because the input to OMEN is the library implementation alone, it can be seamlessly integrated into the software development process.",

      "Abstract": "The C programming language does not prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses. There exist several techniques to secure C programs; however, these methods tend to slow down these programs substantially, because they populate the binary code with runtime checks. To deal with this problem, we have designed and tested two static analyses - symbolic region and range analysis - which we combine to remove the majority of these guards. In addition to the analyses themselves, we bring two other contributions. First, we describe live range splitting strategies that improve the efficiency and the precision of our analyses. Secondly, we show how to deal with integer overflows, a phenomenon that can compromise the correctness of static algorithms that validate memory accesses. We validate our claims by incorporating our findings into AddressSanitizer. We generate SPEC CINT 2006 code that is 17% faster and 9% more energy efficient than the code produced originally by this tool. Furthermore, our approach is 50% more effective than Pentagons, a state-of-the-art analysis to sanitize memory accesses.",

      "Abstract": "Inclusion-based alias analysis for C can be formulated as a context-free language (CFL) reachability problem. It is well known that the traditional cubic CFL-reachability algorithm does not scale well in practice. We present a highly scalable and efficient CFL-reachability-based alias analysis for C. The key novelty of our algorithm is to propagate reachability information along only original graph edges and bypass a large portion of summary edges, while the traditional CFL-reachability algorithm propagates along all summary edges. We also utilize the Four Russians\u2019 Trick - a key enabling technique in the subcubic CFL-reachability algorithm - in our alias analysis. We have implemented our subcubic alias analysis and conducted extensive experiments on widely-used C programs from the pointer analysis literature. The results demonstrate that our alias analysis scales extremely well in practice. In particular, it can analyze the recent Linux kernel (which consists of 10M SLOC) in about 30 seconds.",

      "Abstract": "Values need to be represented differently when interacting with certain language features. For example, an integer needs to take an object-like representation when interacting with erased generics, although, for performance reasons, it normally uses the direct representation. In order to simplify the work of programmers, languages like ML and Scala expose the high-level concept (the integer) and let the compiler handle representation and conversion.\nThis pattern appears in multiple language features such as value classes, specialization and multi-stage programming mechanisms: they all expose a concept which they later refine into multiple representations. Yet, their implementations are ad-hoc and entangle the core mechanism with assumptions about the alternative representation and the implementation of generics, thus losing sight of the general principle.\nIn this paper we present an elegant and minimalistic type-driven generalization that subsumes and improves the state-of-the-art representation transformations. In doing so, we make two key observations: (1) annotated types conveniently capture the semantics of using alternative representations and (2) local type inference can be used to automatically, reliably and optimally introduce the necessary conversions.\nWe validated our approach by implementing three language features in the Scala compiler: value classes, specialization via miniboxing and a simplified multi-stage programming mechanism. An encouraging result was that we were able to reimplement and extend value class functionality in the Scala compiler with the equivalent of two man-weeks of work, without reusing any code from the previous implementation.",

      "Abstract": "We present a novel technique for producing bounded exhaustive test suites from hybrid invariants, i.e., invariants that are expressed imperatively, declaratively, or as a combination of declarative and imperative predicates. Hybrid specifications are processed using known mechanisms for the imperative and declarative parts, but combined in a way that enables us to exploit information from the declarative side, such as \\emph{tight bounds} computed from the declarative specification, to improve the search both on the imperative and declarative sides. Moreover, our technique automatically evaluates all different possible ways of processing the imperative side, and the alternative setting (imperative or declarative) for each part of the invariant available both declaratively and imperatively, in order to decide the most convenient invariant configuration with respect to efficiency in test generation. This is achieved by transcoping, i.e., by assessing the efficiency of the different alternatives on small scopes (where generation times are negligible) and then extrapolating the results to larger scopes.\nWe also show experiments involving collection classes that support the effectiveness of our technique, by demonstrating that \\emph{(i)} bounded exhaustive suites can be computed from hybrid invariants significantly more efficiently than doing so using state-of-the-art purely imperative and purely declarative approaches, and \\emph{(ii)} our technique is able to automatically determine efficient hybrid invariants, in the sense that they lead to an efficient computation of bounded exhaustive suites, using transcoping.",

      "Abstract": "MATLAB is a popular dynamic array-based language commonly used by students, scientists and engineers who appreciate the interactive development style, the rich set of array operators, the extensive builtin library, and the fact that they do not have to declare static types. Even though these users like to program in MATLAB, their computations are often very compute-intensive and are better suited for emerging high performance computing systems. This paper reports on MIX10, a source-to-source compiler that automatically translates MATLAB programs to X10, a language designed for \u201cPerformance and Productivity at Scale\u201d; thus, helping scientific programmers make better use of high performance computing systems.\nThere is a large semantic gap between the array-based dynamically-typed nature of MATLAB and the object-oriented, statically-typed, and high-level array abstractions of X10. This paper addresses the major challenges that must be overcome to produce sequential X10 code that is competitive with state-of-the-art static compilers for MATLAB which target more conventional imperative languages such as C and Fortran. Given that efficient basis, the paper then provides a translation for the MATLAB parfor construct that leverages the powerful concurrency constructs in X10.\nThe MIX10 compiler has been implemented using the McLab compiler tools, is open source, and is available both for compiler researchers and end-user MATLAB programmers. We have used the implementation to perform many empirical measurements on a set of 17 MATLAB benchmarks. We show that our best MIX10- generated code is significantly faster than the de facto Mathworks\u2019 MATLAB system, and that our results are competitive with state-of-the-art static compilers that target C and Fortran. We also show the importance of finding the correct approach to representing the arrays in the generated X10 code, and the necessity of an \u2018IntegerOkay\u2019 analysis that determines which double variables can be safely represented as integers. Finally, we show that our X10-based handling of the MATLAB parfor greatly outperforms the de facto MATLAB implementation.",

      "Abstract": "Weak memory models formalize the inconsistent behaviors that one can expect to observe in multithreaded programs running on modern hardware. In so doing, however, they complicate the already-difficult task of reasoning about correctness of concurrent code. Worse, they render impotent the sophisticated formal methods that have been developed to tame concurrency, which almost universally assume a strong (i.e. sequentially consistent) memory model.\nThis paper introduces GPS, the first program logic to provide a full-fledged suite of modern verification techniques\u2014including ghost state, protocols, and separation logic\u2014for high-level, structured reasoning about weak memory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GPS by applying it to challenging examples drawn from the Linux kernel as well as lock-free data structures. We also define the semantics of GPS and prove in Coq that it is sound with respect to the axiomatic C11 weak memory model.",

But indirection does not come for free \u2013 it has a high cost in performance!\nWhen performance matters, programmers pick C over high-level alternatives.

While there are successful program generators for key libraries (BLAS, FFT), generative programming has remained somewhat of a black art.\nThis tutorial provides a step-by-step introduction to the open-source LMS (Lightweight Modular Staging) framework, which brings runtime code generation and compilation to Scala programs.\nAs an example of serious systems-level programming, we will build, within this 90 minute tutorial, a SQL query engine that outperforms existing database systems and consists of just about 500 lines of high-level Scala code.\nAlong the way, we will discuss powerful generative programming patterns such as mixed-stage (static/dynamic) data structures and mechanically turning interpreters into compilers through staging (e.g. for SQL queries or regular expressions).",

      "Abstract": "Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) environments simplify writing parallel code for clusters because they make data movement implicit \u2014 dereferencing global pointers automatically moves data around. However, it does not free the programmer from needing to reason about locality \u2014 poor placement of data can lead to excessive and even unnecessary communication. For this reason, modern PGAS languages such as X10, Chapel, and UPC allow programmers to express data layout constraints and explicitly move computation. This places an extra burden on the programmer, and is less effective for applications with limited or data-dependent locality (e.g., graph analytics).\nThis paper proposes Alembic, a new static analysis that frees programmers from having to manually move computation to exploit locality in PGAS programs. It works by determining regions of code that access the same cluster node, then transforming the code to automatically migrate parts of the execution by passing around continuations to increase the proportion of accesses to local data. We implement the analysis and transformation for C++ in LLVM and show that in irregular application kernels, Alembic can achieve 82% of the hand-tuned performance (for comparison, na&iuml;ve compiler-generated communication achieves only 13%).",

By raising the common denominator of computing to a foundation that is metadata friendly, structured editing can place human-readable strings and graphical user interfaces on the same spectrum.

      "Abstract": "Today, Java is regularly used to implement large multi-threaded server-class applications that use locks to protect access to shared data. However, understanding the impact of locks on the performance of a system is complex, and thus the use of locks can impede the progress of threads on configurations that were not anticipated by the developer, during specific phases of the execution. In this paper, we propose Free Lunch, a new lock profiler for Java application servers, specifically designed to identify, in-vivo, phases where the progress of the threads is impeded by a lock. Free Lunch is designed around a new metric, critical section pressure (CSP), which directly correlates the progress of the threads to each of the locks. Using Free Lunch, we have identified phases of high CSP, which were hidden with other lock profilers, in the distributed Cassandra NoSQL database and in several applications from the DaCapo 9.12, the SPECjvm2008 and the SPECjbb2005 benchmark suites. Our evaluation of Free Lunch shows that its overhead is never greater than 6%, making it suitable for in-vivo use.",

      "Abstract": "The HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is a JIT compiler and runtime for PHP. While PHP values are dynamically typed, real programs often have latent types that are useful for optimization once discovered. Some types can be proven through static analysis, but limitations in the ahead-of-time approach leave some types to be discovered at run time. Although many values have latent types, PHP programs can also contain polymorphic variables and expressions, which must be handled without catastrophic slowdown.\nHHVM discovers latent types by structuring its JIT around the concept of a tracelet. A tracelet is approximately a basic block specialized for a particular set of run time types for its input values. Tracelets allow HHVM to exactly and efficiently learn the types used by the program, while using a simple compiler. We find HHVM provides high levels of performance, without sacrificing compatibility or interactivity.",

Our implementation builds on a framework that optimizes AST interpreters using just-in-time compilation. In such a system, it is crucial that AST optimizations do not prevent subsequent optimizations. Our system was carefully designed to avoid this problem.

      "Abstract": "Writing concurrent software while achieving both correctness and efficiency is a grand challenge. To facilitate this task, concurrent data structures have been introduced into the standard library of popular languages like Java and C#. Unfortunately, while the operations exposed by concurrent data structures behave atomically, compositions of these operations are not necessarily atomic. Recent studies have found many erroneous implementations of composed concurrent operations. \nWe address the problem of fixing nonlinearizable composed operations such that they behave atomically. We introduce Flint, an automated fixing algorithm for composed Map operations. Flint accepts as input a composed operation suffering from atomicity violations. Its output, if fixing succeeds, is a composed operation that behaves equivalently to the original operation in sequential runs and is guaranteed to be atomic. To our knowledge, Flint is the first general algorithm for fixing incorrect concurrent compositions. \nWe have evaluated Flint on 48 incorrect compositions from 27 popular applications, including Tomcat and MyFaces. The results are highly encouraging: Flint is able to correct 96% of the methods, and the fixed version is often the same as the fix by an expert programmer and as efficient as the original code.",

      "Abstract": "We address the problem of computing semantic differences between a program and a patched version of the program. Our goal is to obtain a precise characterization of the difference between program versions, or establish their equivalence. We focus on infinite-state numerical programs, and use abstract interpretation to compute an over-approximation of program differences.\nComputing differences and establishing equivalence under abstraction requires abstracting relationships between variables in the two programs. Towards that end, we use a correlating abstract domain to compute a sound approximation of these relationships which captures semantic difference. This approximation can be computed over any interleaving of the two programs. However, the choice of interleaving can significantly affect precision. We present a speculative search algorithm that aims to find an interleaving of the two programs with minimal abstract semantic difference. This method is unique as it allows the analysis to dynamically alternate between several interleavings.\nWe have implemented our approach and applied it to real-world examples including patches from Git, GNU Coreutils, as well as a few handpicked patches from the Linux kernel and the Mozilla Firefox web browser. Our evaluation shows that we compute precise approximations of semantic differences, and report few false differences.",

      "Abstract": "The proliferation of multicore processors warrants parallelism as the future of computing, increasing demand to write parallel programs for increased application performance. Previous experience has shown that writing explicitly parallel programs is inherently more difficult than writing sequential programs. Programmers need parallel programming models, constructs, and tools that can simplify writing of parallel programs. In this poster, we present an innovative new tool, HJ-Viz, which generates interactive Computation Graphs (CGs) of parallel programs by analyzing event logs. The visual feedback can prove valuable for a programmer to efficiently optimize program logic and eliminate the presence of potential bugs which may otherwise be difficult to detect. For example, in cases of deadlocks, HJ-Viz enables users to visualize and easily diagnose the deadlock scenario using a web-browser based interface.",

We describe our Coq verification of a compiler for a high-level language, such that the compiler correctness theorem allows us to derive partial-correctness Hoare-logic theorems for programs built by linking the assembly code output by our compiler and assembly code produced by other means. Our compiler supports such tricky features as storable cross-language function pointers, without giving up the usual benefits of being able to verify different compiler phases (including, in our case, two classic optimizations) independently. The key technical innovation is a mixed operational and axiomatic semantics for the source language, with a built-in notion of abstract data types, such that compiled code interfaces with other languages only through axiomatically specified methods that mutate encapsulated private data, represented in whatever formats are most natural for those languages.",

Indeed, most GPU programming languages limit the user to simple data structures\u2013typically only multidimensional rectangular arrays of scalar values. Many algorithms are more naturally expressed using higher level language features, such as algebraic data types (ADTs) and first class procedures, yet building these structures in a manner suitable for a GPU remains a challenge. We present a region-based memory management approach that enables rich data structures in Harlan, a language for data parallel computing. Regions enable rich data structures by providing a uniform representation for pointers on both the CPU and GPU and by providing a means of transferring entire data structures between CPU and GPU memory. We demonstrate Harlan\u2019s increased expressiveness on several example programs and show that Harlan performs well on more traditional data-parallel problems.",

      "Abstract": "Wildcard annotations can improve the generality of Java generic libraries, but require heavy manual effort. We present an algorithm for refactoring and inferring more general type instantiations of Java generics using wildcards. Compared to past approaches, our work is practical and immediately applicable: we assume no changes to the Java type system, while taking into account all its intricacies. Our system allows users to select declarations (variables, method parameters, return types, etc.) to generalize and considers declarations not declared in available source code. It then per- forms an inter-procedural flow analysis and a method body analysis, in order to generalize type signatures. We evaluate our technique on six Java generic libraries. We find that 30% of available declarations of variant type signatures can be generalized\u2014i.e., relaxed with more general wildcard types. On average, 228 other declarations need to be updated when a declaration is generalized, showing that this refactoring would be too tedious and error-prone to perform manually.",

      "Abstract": "Testing and static analysis can help root out bugs in programs, but not in data. This paper introduces data debugging, an approach that combines program analysis and statistical analysis to find potential data errors. Since it is impossible to know a priori whether data are erroneous or not, data debugging locates data that has an unusual impact on the computation. Such data is either very important, or wrong. Data debugging is especially useful in the context of data-intensive program- ming environments that intertwine data with programs in the form of queries or formulas. We present the first data debugging tool, CheckCell, an add-in for Microsoft Excel. CheckCell identifies cells that have an unusually high impact on the spreadsheet\u2019s computations. We show that CheckCell is both analytically and empirically fast and effective. We show that it successfully finds injected typographical errors produced by a generative model trained with data entry from 100,000 Mechanical Turk tasks. CheckCell also automatically identifies a key flaw in the infamous Reinhart and Rogoff spreadsheet.",

Existing function call predictions are mainly built on statistical patterns, suitable for predicting a single call but not a sequence of calls. This paper presents a new way to enable call sequence prediction, which exploits program structures through Probabilistic Calling Automata (PCA), a new program representation that captures both the inherent ensuing relations among function calls, and the probabilistic nature of execution paths. It shows that PCA-based prediction outperforms existing predictions, yielding substantial speedup when being applied to guide Just-In-Time compilation. By enabling accurate, efficient call sequence prediction for the first time, PCA-based predictors open up many new opportunities for dynamic program optimizations.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of GPS by applying it to challenging examples drawn from the Linux kernel as well as lock-free data structures.

      "Abstract": "We will conduct an interactive tutorial describing how to evaluate the impact of language design decisions on people, focusing on objective and data-driven methods. This includes a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative empirical techniques, strategies for conducting experiments or randomized controlled trials, and case studies of what can/cannot be tackled using such methods. We will also discuss the evidence for or against competing design choices, showing what current beliefs in language design are confirmed, plausible, busted, or which have not been tested. Finally, participants will practice designing experimental protocols, obtaining expert feedback on the alternatives.",

      "Abstract": "This paper aims at detecting an important type of design similarity patterns, so-called collaborative patterns, that has not been addressed in the software clone research so far. Collaborative patterns appear as recurring configurations of collaborating components such as methods or classes. Knowing location of such patterns and exact differences among them is useful in program understanding, better change impact analysis, code compaction, software maintenance, and in reuse. In the proposed approach for detecting collaborative patterns, we instrument the subject program with extra code to generate program execution traces. Then, we analyze generated traces to find collaborative patterns. Preliminary investigation has also been done to validate the proposed approach.",

      "Abstract": "Java programmers are faced with numerous choices in managing concurrent execution on multicore platforms. These choices often have different trade-offs (e.g., performance, scalability, and correctness guarantees). This paper analyzes an additional dimension, energy consumption. It presents an empirical study aiming to illuminate the relationship between the choices and settings of thread management constructs and energy consumption. We consider three important thread management constructs in concurrent programming: explicit thread creation, fixed-size thread pooling, and work stealing. We further shed light on the energy/performance trade-off of three \u201ctuning knobs\u201d of these constructs: the number of threads, the task division strategy, and the characteristics of processed data. Through an extensive experimental space exploration over real-world Java programs, we produce a list of findings about the energy behaviors of concurrent programs, which are not always obvious. The study serves as a first step toward improving energy efficiency of concurrent programs on parallel architectures.",

      "Abstract": "A scalable programming language is one in which the same concepts can describe small as well as large parts. Towards this goal, Scala unifies concepts from object and module systems. An essential ingredient of this unification is the concept of objects with type members, which can be referenced through path-dependent types. Unfortunately, path-dependent types are not well-understood, and have been a roadblock in grounding the Scala type system on firm theory.\nWe study several calculi for path-dependent types. We present muDOT which captures the essence \u2013 DOT stands for Dependent Object Types. We explore the design space bottom-up, teasing apart inherent from accidental complexities, while fully mechanizing our models at each step. Even in this simple setting, many interesting patterns arise from the interaction of structural and nominal features.\nWhereas our simple calculus enjoys many desirable and intuitive properties, we demonstrate that the theory gets much more complicated once we add another Scala feature, type refinement, or extend the subtyping relation to a lattice. We discuss possible remedies and trade-offs in modeling type systems for Scala-like languages.",

      "Abstract": "The C preprocessor is widely used to handle variability and solve portability issues in program families. In this context, developers normally use tools like GCC and Clang. However, these tools are not variability-aware, i.e., they preprocess the code and consider each family member individually. As a result, even well-known and widely used families, such as Linux and Apache, contain bad smells and bugs related to variability. To minimize this problem, we propose an approach to safely evolve C program families. We develop a strategy to detect bugs related to variability and define refactorings to remove bad smells in preprocessor directives. Our supporting tool, Colligens, implements our strategy to detect bugs and applies our refactorings automatically. By using our approach in 40 open-source C program families, we detect 121 bugs related to variability, and developers accepted 78% of the patches we submit. Also, we remove 477 bad smells in 12 C program families without clone code as in previous studies.",

      "Abstract": "Values need to be represented differently when interacting with certain language features. For example, an integer needs to take an object-like representation when interacting with erased generics, although, for performance reasons, it normally uses the direct representation. In order to simplify the work of programmers, languages like ML and Scala expose the high-level concept (the integer) and let the compiler handle representation and conversion.\nThis pattern appears in multiple language features such as value classes, specialization and multi-stage programming mechanisms: they all expose a concept which they later refine into multiple representations. Yet, their implementations are ad-hoc and entangle the core mechanism with assumptions about the alternative representation and the implementation of generics, thus losing sight of the general principle.\nIn this paper we present an elegant and minimalistic type-driven generalization that subsumes and improves the state-of-the-art representation transformations. In doing so, we make two key observations: (1) annotated types conveniently capture the semantics of using alternative representations and (2) local type inference can be used to automatically, reliably and optimally introduce the necessary conversions.\nWe validated our approach by implementing three language features in the Scala compiler: value classes, specialization via miniboxing and a simplified multi-stage programming mechanism. An encouraging result was that we were able to reimplement and extend value class functionality in the Scala compiler with the equivalent of two man-weeks of work, without reusing any code from the previous implementation.",

      "Abstract": "Automatic type inference is a popular feature of functional programming languages. If a program cannot be typed, the compiler typically reports a single program location in its error message. This location is the point where the type inference failed, but not necessarily the actual source of the error. Other potential error sources are not even considered. Hence, the compiler often misses the true error source, which increases debugging time for the programmer. In this paper, we present a general framework for automatic localization of type errors. Our algorithm finds all minimum error sources, where the exact definition of minimum is given in terms of a compiler-specific ranking criterion. Compilers can use minimum error sources to produce more meaningful error reports, and for automatic error correction. Our approach works by reducing type inference to constraint satisfaction. We then formulate the problem of computing minimum error sources in terms of weighted maximum satisfiability modulo theories (MaxSMT). Ranking criteria are incorporated by assigning weights to typing constraints. The reduction to MaxSMT allows us to built on SMT solvers to support rich type systems. We have implemented an instance of our framework targeted at Hindley-Milner type systems. We have evaluated our implementation on existing OCaml benchmarks for type error localization and showed that our approach can find minimum error sources subject to useful ranking criteria.",

      "Abstract": "Graphics processing units (GPUs) can effectively accelerate many applications, but their applicability has been largely limited to problems whose solutions can be expressed neatly in terms of linear algebra. Indeed, most GPU programming languages limit the user to simple data structures\u2013typically only multidimensional rectangular arrays of scalar values. Many algorithms are more naturally expressed using higher level language features, such as algebraic data types (ADTs) and first class procedures, yet building these structures in a manner suitable for a GPU remains a challenge. We present a region-based memory management approach that enables rich data structures in Harlan, a language for data parallel computing. Regions enable rich data structures by providing a uniform representation for pointers on both the CPU and GPU and by providing a means of transferring entire data structures between CPU and GPU memory. We demonstrate Harlan\u2019s increased expressiveness on several example programs and show that Harlan performs well on more traditional data-parallel problems.",

      "Abstract": "Testing and static analysis can help root out bugs in programs, but not in data. This paper introduces data debugging, an approach that combines program analysis and statistical analysis to find potential data errors. Since it is impossible to know a priori whether data are erroneous or not, data debugging locates data that has an unusual impact on the computation. Such data is either very important, or wrong. Data debugging is especially useful in the context of data-intensive program- ming environments that intertwine data with programs in the form of queries or formulas. We present the first data debugging tool, CheckCell, an add-in for Microsoft Excel. CheckCell identifies cells that have an unusually high impact on the spreadsheet\u2019s computations. We show that CheckCell is both analytically and empirically fast and effective. We show that it successfully finds injected typographical errors produced by a generative model trained with data entry from 100,000 Mechanical Turk tasks. CheckCell also automatically identifies a key flaw in the infamous Reinhart and Rogoff spreadsheet.",

      "Abstract": "I/O reduction has been a major focus in optimizing data-parallel programs for big-data processing. While the current state-of-the-art techniques use static program analysis to reduce I/O, Cybertron proposes a new direction that incorporates runtime mechanisms to push the limit further on I/O reduction. In particular, Cybertron tracks how data is used in the computation accurately at runtime to filter unused data at finer granularity dynamically, beyond what current static-analysis based mechanisms are capable of, and to facilitate a new mechanism called constraint based encoding for more efficient encoding. Cybertron has been implemented and applied to production data-parallel programs; our extensive evaluations on real programs and real data have shown its effectiveness on I/O reduction over the existing mechanisms at reasonable CPU cost, and its improvement on end-to-end performance in various network environments.",

      "Abstract": "The efficiency of a build system is an important enabler of the productivity of software developers. As a result, developer teams have been adopting build systems that allow them to maximize build parallelization. However, migrating the existing legacy build scripts to new build systems is tedious and error-prone. Yet, there has been no prior work that automate migration of build scripts.\nThis paper proposes the first approach for migrating legacy build scripts to new build systems. Our approach works in two phases. In the first phase, from a set of build execution traces, we synthesize build scripts that accurately capture the intent of the original build. However, the synthesized build scripts are typically long and hard to maintain. In the second phase, we apply refactorings that raise the level of abstraction of the synthesized scripts (e.g., extracting common code). As the application order of refactorings may lead to different build scripts, we use a search-based approach that explores various refactoring sequences to identify the best (e.g., shortest) build script. We optimize search-based refactoring with state matching and partial-order reduction to explore more sequences in the same amount of time. We implemented the proposed two-phase migration approach in a tool, called Metamorphosis, which has recently been used within Microsoft.",

      "Abstract": "Event-driven applications typically have a single thread of execution that processes event handlers in response to input events triggered by the user, the network, or other applications. Programmers must ensure that event handlers terminate after a short amount of time because otherwise, the application may become unresponsive. This paper presents EventBreak, a performance-guided test generation technique to identify and analyze event handlers whose execution time may gradually increase while using the application. The key idea is to systematically search for pairs of events where triggering one event increases the execution time of the other event. For example, this situation may happen because one event accumulates data that is processed by the other event. We implement the approach for JavaScript-based web applications and apply it to three real-world applications. EventBreak discovers events with an execution time that gradually increases in an unbounded way, which makes the application unresponsive, and events that, if triggered repeatedly, reveal a severe scalability problem, which makes the application unusable. The approach reveals two known bugs and four previously unknown responsiveness problems. Furthermore, we show that EventBreak helps in testing that event handlers avoid such problems by bounding a handler\u2019s execution time.",

      "Abstract": "Oliveira and Cook (2012) and Oliveira et al. (2013) have recently introduced object algebras as a program structuring technique to improve the modularity and extensibility of programs. We analyze the relationship between object algebras and attribute grammars (AGs), a formalism to augment context-free grammars with attributes. We present an an extension of the object algebra technique with which the full class of L-attributed grammars \u2013 an important class of AGs that corresponds to one-pass compilers \u2013 can be encoded in Scala. The encoding is modular (attributes can be defined and type-checked separately), scalable (the size of the encoding is linear in the size of the AG specification) and compositional (each AG artefact is represented as a semantic object of the host language). To validate these claims, we have formalized the encoding and we have re-implemented a one-pass compiler for a subset of C with our technique. We also discuss how advanced features of modern AG systems, such as higher-order and parameterized attributes, reference attributes, and forwarding can be supported.",

      "Abstract": "Wildcard annotations can improve the generality of Java generic libraries, but require heavy manual effort. We present an algorithm for refactoring and inferring more general type instantiations of Java generics using wildcards. Compared to past approaches, our work is practical and immediately applicable: we assume no changes to the Java type system, while taking into account all its intricacies. Our system allows users to select declarations (variables, method parameters, return types, etc.) to generalize and considers declarations not declared in available source code. It then per- forms an inter-procedural flow analysis and a method body analysis, in order to generalize type signatures. We evaluate our technique on six Java generic libraries. We find that 30% of available declarations of variant type signatures can be generalized\u2014i.e., relaxed with more general wildcard types. On average, 228 other declarations need to be updated when a declaration is generalized, showing that this refactoring would be too tedious and error-prone to perform manually.",

      "Abstract": "Title\nHumane Representation of Thought: A Trail Map for the 21st Century ACM DOI\nAbstract\nNew representations of thought \u2014 written language, mathematical notation, information graphics, etc \u2014 have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity\u2019s collectively-thinkable territory.\nBut at debilitating cost. These representations, having been invented for static media such as paper, tap into a small subset of human capabilities and neglect the rest. Knowledge work means sitting at a desk, interpreting and manipulating symbols. The human body is reduced to an eye staring at tiny rectangles and fingers on a pen or keyboard.\nLike any severely unbalanced way of living, this is crippling to mind and body. But less obviously, and more importantly, it is enormously wasteful of the vast human potential. Human beings naturally have many powerful modes of thinking and understanding. Most are incompatible with static media. In a culture that has contorted itself around the limitations of marks on paper, these modes are undeveloped, unrecognized, or scorned.\nWe are now seeing the start of a dynamic medium. To a large extent, people today are using this medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper, and to further constrain the ways in which the human body can interact with external representations of thought.\nBut the dynamic medium offers the opportunity to deliberately invent a humane and empowering form of knowledge work. We can design dynamic representations which draw on the entire range of human capabilities \u2014 all senses, all forms of movement, all forms of understanding \u2014 instead of straining a few and atrophying the rest.\nThis talk suggests how each of the human activities in which thought is externalized (conversing, presenting, reading, writing, etc) can be redesigned around such representations.",

      "Abstract": "Garbage collectors for managed languages are exact or conservative. An exact collector identifies references precisely and may move referents and update references. A conservative collector is constrained by ambiguous references in two ways. (1) Since they may be pointers, the collectors must retain referents. (2) Since they may be values, the collectors cannot modify them, pinning their referents. This paper is the first to show that retaining dead objects and pinning objects affects remarkably few heap objects: for Java benchmarks, &lt; 0.01% are falsely retained and 0.03% are pinned.\nThe larger effect is collector design. Prior conservative collectors either (1) use mark-sweep and forgo moving all objects, or (2) use mostly copying and pin entire pages. This paper shows this overhead is substantial: 12% and 45% respectively, compared to generational collection in a Java VM. We introduce high performance conservative Immix and reference counting (RC). Immix is a mark-region collector that combines fine line-grain pinning and opportunistic copying of unambiguous referents. Deferred RC simply needs an object map to deliver the first conservative RC in the literature. We implement six exact collectors and their conservative counterparts. Conservative Immix variants and RC come within 2 to 3% of their exact counterparts. In particular, conservative RC Immix is slightly faster than a well-tuned exact generational collector. For managed languages, these findings show conservative collection is compatible with high performance.",

      "Abstract": "Many vertex-centric graph algorithms can be expressed via asynchronous parallelism by relaxing certain read-after-write data dependences and thus allowing threads to compute vertex values using stale (i.e., not the most recent) values of their neighboring vertices. We observe that on distributed shared memory systems, by converting synchronous algorithms into their asynchronous counterparts, algorithms can be made tolerant to high inter-node communication latency. However, high inter-node communication latency can lead to excessive use of stale values causing an increase in the number of iterations required by the algorithm to converge. In this paper we design a relaxed memory consistency model and consistency protocol that simultaneously tolerate communication latency and minimize the use of stale values. We demonstrate that for a range of asynchronous graph algorithms, on an average, our approach outperforms algorithms based upon: prior relaxed memory models that allow stale values by at least 2.27x; and Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model by 4.2x. We also show that our approach performs well in comparison to GraphLab, a popular distributed graph processing framework.",

      "Abstract": "Today, Java is regularly used to implement large multi-threaded server-class applications that use locks to protect access to shared data. However, understanding the impact of locks on the performance of a system is complex, and thus the use of locks can impede the progress of threads on configurations that were not anticipated by the developer, during specific phases of the execution. In this paper, we propose Free Lunch, a new lock profiler for Java application servers, specifically designed to identify, in-vivo, phases where the progress of the threads is impeded by a lock. Free Lunch is designed around a new metric, critical section pressure (CSP), which directly correlates the progress of the threads to each of the locks. Using Free Lunch, we have identified phases of high CSP, which were hidden with other lock profilers, in the distributed Cassandra NoSQL database and in several applications from the DaCapo 9.12, the SPECjvm2008 and the SPECjbb2005 benchmark suites. Our evaluation of Free Lunch shows that its overhead is never greater than 6%, making it suitable for in-vivo use.",

      "Abstract": "We want better programming languages, but \u201cbetter\u201d invariably ends up becoming \u201cbigger\u201d. Since we can\u2019t keep making our languages bigger, what alternatives do we have? I propose language composition as a possible solution to this long standing problem. Language composition means merging two languages and allowing them to be used together. At its most fine-grained, this could allow multiple programming languages to be used together within a single source file. However, language composition is not a new idea. It has failed in the past because editing composed programs was intolerably difficult and the resulting programs ran too slow to be usable. Without good solutions to these problems, language composition will remain an unrealised ideal. I will show how the work we are doing is beginning to address both aspects. We have built a prototype editor utilising a novel concept \u2018language boxes\u2019, which allows one to edit composed programs in a natural way. We are tackling the performance problem by composing together interpreters using meta-tracing, allowing us to build composed VMs with custom JITs that naturally optimise across different language\u2019s run-times. While we are much nearer the beginning of the journey than the end, our initial research has allowed us to build a simple composition of two very different languages: Python and Prolog.",

      "Abstract": "Despite the advances made by modern parsing strategies such as PEG, LL(*), GLR, and GLL, parsing is not a solved problem. Existing approaches suffer from a number of weaknesses, including difficulties supporting side-effecting embedded actions, slow and/or unpredictable performance, and counterintuitive matching strategies. This paper introduces the ALL(*) parsing strategy that combines the simplicity, efficiency, and predictability of conventional top-down LL(k) parsers with the power of a GLR-like mechanism to make parsing decisions. The critical innovation is to move grammar analysis to parse-time, which lets ALL(*) handle any non-left-recursive context-free grammar. ALL(*) is O(n^4) in theory but consistently performs linearly on grammars used in practice, outperforming general strategies such as GLL and GLR by orders of magnitude. ANTLR 4 generates ALL(*) parsers and supports direct left-recursion through grammar rewriting. Widespread ANTLR 4 use (5000 downloads/month in 2013) provides evidence that ALL(*) is effective for a wide variety of applications.",

      "Abstract": "Surveys can be viewed as programs, complete with logic, control flow, and bugs. Word choice or the order in which questions are asked can unintentionally bias responses. Vague, confusing, or intrusive questions can cause respondents to abandon a survey. Surveys can also have runtime errors: inattentive respondents can taint results. This effect is especially problematic when deploying surveys in uncontrolled settings, such as on the web or via crowdsourcing platforms. Because the results of surveys drive business decisions and inform scientific conclusions, it is crucial to make sure they are correct.\nWe present SurveyMan, a system for designing, deploying, and automatically debugging surveys. Survey authors write their surveys in a lightweight domain-specific language aimed at end users. SurveyMan statically analyzes the survey to provide feedback to survey authors before deployment. It then compiles the survey into JavaScript and deploys it either to the web or a crowdsourcing platform. SurveyMan\u2019s dynamic analyses automatically find survey bugs, and control for the quality of responses. We evaluate SurveyMan\u2019s algorithms analytically and empirically, demonstrating its effectiveness with case studies of social science surveys conducted via Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk.",

      "Abstract": "There are many domain libraries, but despite the performance benefits of compilation, domain-specific languages are comparatively rare due to the high cost of implementing an optimizing compiler. We propose commensal compilation, a new strategy for compiling embedded domain-specific languages by reusing the massive investment in modern language virtual machine platforms. Commensal compilers use the host language\u2019s front-end, use an autotuner instead of optimization heuristics, and use host platform APIs that enable back-end optimizations by the host platform JIT. The cost of implementing a commensal compiler is only the cost of implementing the domain-specific optimizations. We demonstrate the concept by implementing a commensal compiler for the stream programming language StreamJIT atop the Java platform. Our compiler achieves performance comparable to StreamIt\u2019s native code (via GCC) compiler with considerably less implementation effort.",

      "Abstract": "MATLAB is a popular dynamic array-based language commonly used by students, scientists and engineers who appreciate the interactive development style, the rich set of array operators, the extensive builtin library, and the fact that they do not have to declare static types. Even though these users like to program in MATLAB, their computations are often very compute-intensive and are better suited for emerging high performance computing systems. This paper reports on MIX10, a source-to-source compiler that automatically translates MATLAB programs to X10, a language designed for \u201cPerformance and Productivity at Scale\u201d; thus, helping scientific programmers make better use of high performance computing systems.\nThere is a large semantic gap between the array-based dynamically-typed nature of MATLAB and the object-oriented, statically-typed, and high-level array abstractions of X10. This paper addresses the major challenges that must be overcome to produce sequential X10 code that is competitive with state-of-the-art static compilers for MATLAB which target more conventional imperative languages such as C and Fortran. Given that efficient basis, the paper then provides a translation for the MATLAB parfor construct that leverages the powerful concurrency constructs in X10.\nThe MIX10 compiler has been implemented using the McLab compiler tools, is open source, and is available both for compiler researchers and end-user MATLAB programmers. We have used the implementation to perform many empirical measurements on a set of 17 MATLAB benchmarks. We show that our best MIX10- generated code is significantly faster than the de facto Mathworks\u2019 MATLAB system, and that our results are competitive with state-of-the-art static compilers that target C and Fortran. We also show the importance of finding the correct approach to representing the arrays in the generated X10 code, and the necessity of an \u2018IntegerOkay\u2019 analysis that determines which double variables can be safely represented as integers. Finally, we show that our X10-based handling of the MATLAB parfor greatly outperforms the de facto MATLAB implementation.",

      "Abstract": "An incremental computation updates its result based on a change to its input, which is often an order of magnitude faster than a recomputation from scratch. In particular, incrementalization can make expensive computations feasible for settings that require short feedback cycles, such as interactive systems, IDEs, or (soft) real-time systems.\nThis paper presents i3QL, a general-purpose programming language for specifying incremental computations. i3QL provides a declarative SQL-like syntax and is based on incremental versions of operators from relational algebra, enriched with support for general recursion. We integrated i3QL into Scala as a library, which enables programmers to use regular Scala code for non-incremental subcomputations of an i3QL query and to easily integrate incremental computations into larger software projects. To improve performance, i3QL optimizes user-defined queries by applying algebraic laws and partial evaluation. We describe the design and implementation of i3QL and its optimizations, demonstrate its applicability, and evaluate its performance.",

      "Abstract": "Many real programs are written in multiple different programming languages, and supporting this pattern creates challenges for formal compiler verification. We describe our Coq verification of a compiler for a high-level language, such that the compiler correctness theorem allows us to derive partial-correctness Hoare-logic theorems for programs built by linking the assembly code output by our compiler and assembly code produced by other means. Our compiler supports such tricky features as storable cross-language function pointers, without giving up the usual benefits of being able to verify different compiler phases (including, in our case, two classic optimizations) independently. The key technical innovation is a mixed operational and axiomatic semantics for the source language, with a built-in notion of abstract data types, such that compiled code interfaces with other languages only through axiomatically specified methods that mutate encapsulated private data, represented in whatever formats are most natural for those languages.",

      "Abstract": "Writing concurrent software while achieving both correctness and efficiency is a grand challenge. To facilitate this task, concurrent data structures have been introduced into the standard library of popular languages like Java and C#. Unfortunately, while the operations exposed by concurrent data structures behave atomically, compositions of these operations are not necessarily atomic. Recent studies have found many erroneous implementations of composed concurrent operations.\nWe address the problem of fixing nonlinearizable composed operations such that they behave atomically. We introduce Flint, an automated fixing algorithm for composed Map operations. Flint accepts as input a composed operation suffering from atomicity violations. Its output, if fixing succeeds, is a composed operation that behaves equivalently to the original operation in sequential runs and is guaranteed to be atomic. To our knowledge, Flint is the first general algorithm for fixing incorrect concurrent compositions.\nWe have evaluated Flint on 48 incorrect compositions from 27 popular applications, including Tomcat and MyFaces. The results are highly encouraging: Flint is able to correct 96% of the methods, and the fixed version is often the same as the fix by an expert programmer and as efficient as the original code.",

To this end, we have developed two different tuning policies, which enable users\u2019 programs to adjust their level of concurrency at compile-time and run-time respectively. Our approach also opens up many opportunities for programming concurrency policies for different purposes without changing the code of the actual computation.",

      "Abstract": "Static analysis for JavaScript can potentially help programmers find errors early during development. Although much progress has been made on analysis techniques, a major obstacle is the prevalence of libraries, in particular jQuery, which apply programming patterns that have detrimental consequences on the analysis precision and performance. \nPrevious work on dynamic determinacy analysis has demonstrated how information about program expressions that always resolve to a fixed value in some call context may lead to significant scalability improvements of static analysis for such code. We present a static dataflow analysis for JavaScript that infers and exploits determinacy information on-the-fly, to enable analysis of some of the most complex parts of jQuery. The analysis combines selective context and path sensitivity, constant propagation, and branch pruning, based on a systematic investigation of the main causes of analysis imprecision when using a more basic analysis. \nThe techniques are implemented in the TAJS analysis tool and evaluated on a collection of small programs that use jQuery. Our results show that the proposed analysis techniques boost both precision and performance, specifically for inferring type information and call graphs.",

      "Abstract": "Dynamic taint analysis is a well-known information flow analysis problem with many possible applications. Taint tracking allows for analysis of application data flow by assigning labels to inputs, and then propagating those labels through data flow. Taint tracking systems traditionally compromise among performance, precision, accuracy, and portability. Performance can be critical, as these systems are typically intended to be deployed with software, and hence must have low overhead. To be deployed in security-conscious settings, taint tracking must also be accurate and precise. Dynamic taint tracking must be portable in order to be easily deployed and adopted for real world purposes, without requiring recompilation of the operating system or language interpreter, and without requiring access to application source code.\nWe present Phosphor, a dynamic taint tracking system for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that simultaneously achieves our goals of performance, accuracy, precision, and portability. Moreover, to our knowledge, it is the first portable general purpose taint tracking system for the JVM. We evaluated Phosphor\u2019s performance on two commonly used JVM languages (Java and Scala), on two versions of two commonly used JVMs (Oracle\u2019s HotSpot and OpenJDK\u2019s IcedTea) and on Android\u2019s Dalvik Virtual Machine, finding its performance to be impressive: as low as 3% (53% on average), using the DaCapo macro benchmark suite. This paper describes the approach that Phosphor uses to achieve portable taint tracking in the JVM.",

Automating such a translation is challenging: imperative updates must be translated into a functional MapReduce form in a manner that both preserves semantics and enables parallelism. Our approach works by first translating the input code into a functional representation, with loops succinctly represented by fold operations. Then, guided by rewrite rules, our system searches a space of equivalent programs for an effective MapReduce implementation. The rules include a novel technique for handling irregular loop-carried dependencies using group-by operations to enable greater parallelism.\nWe have implemented our technique in a tool called Mold. It translates sequential Java code into code targeting the Apache Spark runtime. We evaluated Mold on several real-world kernels and found that in most cases Mold generated the desired MapReduce program, even for codes with complex indirect updates.",

      "Abstract": "Mobile app markets have lowered the barrier to market entry for software producers. As a consequence, an increasing number of independent app developers offer their products, and recent platforms such as the MIT App Inventor and Microsoft\u2019s TouchDevelop enable even lay programmers to develop apps and distribute them in app markets.\nA major challenge in this distribution model is to ensure the quality of apps. Besides the usual sources of software errors, mobile apps are susceptible to errors caused by the non-determinism of an event-based execution model, a volatile environment, diverse hardware, and others. Many of these errors are difficult to detect during testing, especially for independent app developers, who are not supported by test teams and elaborate test infrastructures.\nTo address this problem, we propose a static program analysis that captures the specifics of mobile apps and is efficient enough to provide feedback during the development process. We present our analysis for TouchDevelop, but most aspects apply also to other platforms. Experiments involving 51,456 published TouchDevelop scripts show that our analysis analyzes 98% of the scripts in under a minute, and five seconds on average. Manual inspection of the analysis results for a selection of all scripts shows that most of the alarms are real errors.",

      "Abstract": "As Computer Science expands to more non-CS majors under the banner of Computational Thinking, it is important that these students perceive the experience as useful to them. Authentic and motivating projects is one way to engage students. To that end, big data - crucial in fields from agriculture to history to science and beyond - offers a promising educational option. However, teaching big data topics to non-CS majors is a challenging undertaking, strewn with technological obstacles such as the unavailability of data, irregular structure, and difficulty of dissemination. To solve the technical difficulties, we introduce a new project: CORGIS - a \u201cCollection of Real-time, Giant, Interesting, Situated Datasets\u201d which encompasses two distinct goals: (1) create a new context for introductory programming, and (2) introduce new content related to big data. CORGIS accommodates both of these goals by means of technological scaffolding. The CORGIS project comprises a collection of libraries that provide an interface to big data for students, and architectures for rapidly enabling new high velocity and high volume data sources. \nIn this talk, we give an overview of CORGIS\u2019 capabilities, review a model (MUSIC) others have developed for assessing student motivation, and discuss how we might apply MUSIC to assess CORGIS.",

Focusing on settings that are exposed to software, we measure the total energy, average power, and execution time of 41 benchmark applications in 220 configurations, across a total of 200,000 program executions.\nSome of the more important findings of the survey include that effective parallelization and compiler optimizations have the potential to save far more energy than Linux\u2019s frequency tuning algorithms; that certain non-complementary energy strategies can undercut each other\u2019s savings by half when combined; and that while the power impacts of most strategies remain constant across applications, the runtime impacts vary, resulting in inconsistent energy impacts.",

      "Abstract": "Mobile app markets have lowered the barrier to market entry for software producers. As a consequence, an increasing number of independent app developers offer their products, and recent platforms such as the MIT App Inventor and Microsoft\u2019s TouchDevelop enable even lay programmers to develop apps and distribute them in app markets.\nA major challenge in this distribution model is to ensure the quality of apps. Besides the usual sources of software errors, mobile apps are susceptible to errors caused by the non-determinism of an event-based execution model, a volatile environment, diverse hardware, and others. Many of these errors are difficult to detect during testing, especially for independent app developers, who are not supported by test teams and elaborate test infrastructures. \nTo address this problem, we propose a static program analysis that captures the specifics of mobile apps and is efficient enough to provide feedback during the development process. We present our analysis for TouchDevelop, but most aspects apply also to other platforms. Experiments involving 51,456 published TouchDevelop scripts show that our analysis analyzes 98% of the scripts in under a minute, and five seconds on average. Manual inspection of the analysis results for a selection of all scripts shows that most of the alarms are real errors.",

      "Abstract": "Oliveira and Cook (2012) and Oliveira et al. (2013) have recently introduced object algebras as a program structur- ing technique to improve the modularity and extensibility of programs. We analyze the relationship between object al- gebras and attribute grammars (AGs), a formalism to aug- ment context-free grammars with attributes. We present an an extension of the object algebra technique with which the full class of L-attributed grammars \u2013 an important class of AGs that corresponds to one-pass compilers \u2013 can be en- coded in Scala. The encoding is modular (attributes can be defined and type-checked separately), scalable (the size of the encoding is linear in the size of the AG specification) and compositional (each AG artefact is represented as a seman- tic object of the host language). To validate these claims, we have formalized the encoding and we have re-implemented a one-pass compiler for a subset of C with our technique. We also discuss how advanced features of modern AG systems, such as higher-order and parameterized attributes, reference attributes, and forwarding can be supported.",

      "Abstract": "Gradual typing combines static and dynamic typing flexibly and safely in a single programming language. To do so, gradually typed languages implicitly insert casts where needed, to ensure at runtime that typing assumptions are not violated by untyped code. However, the implicit nature of cast insertion, especially on higher-order values, can jeopardize reliability and efficiency: higher-order casts can fail at any time, and are costly to execute. We propose Confined Gradual Typing to provide programmers with explicit means to restrict the flexibility of gradual typing to selectively regain reliability and efficiency guarantees. We introduce two new type qualifiers that allow programmers to control the flow of values between the typed and the untyped worlds. We formally develop two variants of Confined Gradual Typing that capture different flexibility/guarantee tradeoffs. We report on the implementation of Confined Gradual Typing in Gradualtalk, a gradually-typed Smalltalk, which confirms the performance advantage of avoiding unwanted higher-order casts and the low overhead of the approach.",

      "Abstract": "The HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) is a JIT compiler and runtime for PHP. While PHP values are dynamically typed, real programs often have latent types that are useful for optimization once discovered. Some types can be proven through static analysis, but limitations in the ahead-of-time approach leave some types to be discovered at run time. Although many values have latent types, PHP programs can also contain polymorphic variables and expressions, which must be handled without catastrophic slowdown.\nHHVM discovers latent types by structuring its JIT around the concept of a tracelet. A tracelet is approximately a basic block specialized for a particular set of run time types for its input values. Tracelets allow HHVM to exactly and efficiently learn the types used by the program, while using a simple compiler. We find HHVM provides high levels of performance, without sacrificing compatibility or interactivity.",

      "Abstract": "Dynamic taint analysis is a well-known information flow analysis problem with many possible applications. Taint tracking allows for analysis of application data flow by assigning labels to inputs, and then propagating those labels through data flow. Taint tracking systems traditionally compromise among performance, precision, accuracy, and portability. Performance can be critical, as these systems are typically intended to be deployed with software, and hence must have low overhead. To be deployed in security-conscious settings, taint tracking must also be accurate and precise. Dynamic taint tracking must be portable in order to be easily deployed and adopted for real world purposes, without requiring recompilation of the operating system or language interpreter, and without requiring access to application source code.\nWe present Phosphor, a dynamic taint tracking system for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that simultaneously achieves our goals of performance, accuracy, precision, and portability. Moreover, to our knowledge, it is the first portable general purpose taint tracking system for the JVM. We evaluated Phosphor\u2019s performance on two commonly used JVM languages (Java and Scala), on two versions of two commonly used JVMs (Oracle\u2019s HotSpot and OpenJDK\u2019s IcedTea) and on Android\u2019s Dalvik Virtual Machine, finding its performance to be impressive: as low as 3% (53% on average), using the DaCapo macro benchmark suite. This paper describes the approach that Phosphor uses to achieve portable taint tracking in the JVM.",

Academics propose research and government (sometimes) funds it. Startups move technologies across the \u201cresearch valley of death\u201d to early adopters. Global corporations make technology widely available by acquiring startups. At every step there are gaps and pitfalls.\nAdoption is the acid test of innovation. Idea-generation is perhaps ten per cent of innovation; most of the work is on technology transfer and adoption. Chance plays a big role in creating opportunities (e.g., R&amp;D involves a lot of luck), but a company\u2019s success depends on its ability to make opportunities more likely to occur, and to capitalize on those opportunities when they arise. Passionate individuals drive technology transfer more than does process; indeed, some people believe that the original researchers need to be involved all the way along the chain. Prototyping is an important practice, often resulting in \u201cresearchware\u201d that proves a concept but is not ready for wide use. Transforming a prototype from the lab to the real-world use is a multi-stage, multi-year undertaking.\nThis talk will use the decade-long evolution of static analysis in code review as a driver for discussion. We\u2019ll talk startups, big companies, venture capital, research agencies, and subject-matter expertise. In general, technologists don\u2019t appreciate business people enough and business people don\u2019t appreciate technology enough. Most successful companies are brilliant at one, but also need to be adequate at the other.",

      "Abstract": "Design and implementation defects that lead to inefficient computation widely exist in software. These defects are difficult to avoid and discover. They lead to severe performance degradation and energy waste during production runs, and are becoming increasingly critical with the meager increase of single-core hardware performance and the increasing concerns about energy constraints. Effective tools that diagnose performance problems and point out the inefficiency root cause is sorely needed.\nThe state of the art of performance diagnosis is preliminary. Profiling can tell where computation resources are spent, but not where and why the resources are wasted. Performance-bug detectors can identify specific type of inefficient computation, but are not suited for diagnosing general performance problems. Effective failure diagnosis techniques, such as statistical debugging, have been proposed for functional bugs. However, whether they work for performance problems is still an open question.\nIn this paper, we first conduct an empirical study to understand how performance problems are observed and reported by real-world users. Our study shows that statistical debugging is a natural fit for diagnosing performance problems, which are often observed through comparison-based approaches and reported together with both good and bad inputs. We then thoroughly investigate different design points in statistical debugging, including three different predicates and two different types of statistical models, to understand which design point works the best for performance diagnosis. Finally, we study how some unique nature of performance bugs allows sampling techniques to lower the overhead of run-time performance diagnosis without extending the diagnosis latency.",

      "Abstract": "Despite the advances made by modern parsing strategies such as PEG, LL(*), GLR, and GLL, parsing is not a solved problem. Existing approaches suffer from a number of weaknesses, including difficulties supporting side-effecting embedded actions, slow and/or unpredictable performance, and counterintuitive matching strategies. This paper introduces the ALL(*) parsing strategy that combines the simplicity, efficiency, and predictability of conventional top-down LL(k) parsers with the power of a GLR-like mechanism to make parsing decisions. The critical innovation is to move grammar analysis to parse-time, which lets ALL(*) handle any non-left-recursive context-free grammar. ALL(*) is O(n^4) in theory but consistently performs linearly on grammars used in practice, outperforming general strategies such as GLL and GLR by orders of magnitude. ANTLR 4 generates ALL(*) parsers and supports direct left-recursion through grammar rewriting. Widespread ANTLR 4 use (5000 downloads/month in 2013) provides evidence that ALL(*) is effective for a wide variety of applications.",

I\u2019m particularly interested in generalist experts, problem-solvers who can reason across the whole range of things they know about. In software design, generalist experts emerge as system architects, the \u201csuper-designers\u201d who can encompass large, complex designs and hold them \u2018in their heads\u2019 - and still understand implications of particular detailed design decisions.",

As applications have become more sophisticated and capable, programmers have chosen managed languages in many domains for ease of development. These languages abstract memory management from the programmer, which can introduce time and space overhead but also provide opportunities for dynamic optimization. Optimizing memory performance is in part paramount because hardware is reaching physical limits. Recent trends towards chip multiprocessor machines exacerbate the memory system bottleneck because they are adding cores without adding commensurate bandwidth. Both language and architecture trends add stress to the memory system and degrade application performance. \nI exploit the language abstraction to analyze and optimize memory efficiency on emerging hardware. In my dissertation, I studied the sources of memory inefficiencies on two levels: heap data and hardware storage traffic. Finding that arrays are a dominant source of heap inefficiency, I designed and implemented z-rays, a flexible, time and space efficient layout of arrays. When analyzing traffic to main memory, I found a large majority of the traffic is useless. I designed a software-hardware cooperative optimization that invalidates data in cache based on passed-down program semantics in order to eliminate useless traffic. These techniques improve memory system efficiency and performance. We show that the memory abstraction in managed languages is not just a cost to be borne, but an opportunity to improve space and time efficiency and overcome the memory wall. We enhance the productivity and performance of ubiquitous managed languages on current and future architectures. \nIn broader terms, I am interested in studying more efficient ways for the application, compiler and runtime system, operating system, and underlying architecture to cooperate for optimal system performance. In particular, each layer of this stack has its own method of memory management that can be limited by its narrow view: there should be more coordination to inform dynamic optimization and overcome the high overheads of memory system performance.",

Towards this goal, I have worked on a variety of topics including pointer and data structure analysis, loop invariant generation, path-sensitive analysis, and compositional reasoning.

      "Bio": "Martin Odersky is a professor at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland. He has been working on programming languages for most of his career. He first studied structured and object-oriented programming as a PhD student of Niklaus Wirth, then fell in love with functional programming while working as a post doc at IBM and Yale. When Java came out, he started to add functional programming constructs to the new platform. This led to Pizza and GJ and eventually to Java 5 with generics. During that time he also developed javac, the current reference compiler for Java. \nOver the last 10 years, Martin worked on unifying object-oriented and functional programming in the Scala language. Scala quickly escaped from the research lab and became a popular open source tool and industrial language. He now oversees development of Scala as head of the programming group at EPFL and as chairman of the Typesafe company.",

I hold the Canada Research Chair in Compiler Tools and Techniques and am a Fellow of the ACM and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.\nHistorically my main area of research area has been the development of compilers for object-oriented and aspect-oriented programming languages. I also have a long-standing interest in pointer analysis and program analysis frameworks.\nMy most recent research focus is on how to bring our compiler expertise to the world of scientists and engineers, and in particular how to support effective and efficient programming in the dynamic programming language MATLAB. To kick-start research in this area we are building a toolkit, McLAB (http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/mclab/), to support language extensions, compiler optimizations and transformations, virtual machines and JITs, and program understanding/refactoring tools for MATLAB and extensions of MATLAB.\nAn important facet of my work is that new research ideas should be developed along with software infrastructures to test those ideas. This has led to the development of many publicly available software frameworks, more details can be found on the group\u2019s web site at http://www.sable.mcgill.ca . Our research group hopes that other groups will use their software, and will contribute new pieces back them so that all compiler groups can benefit from the work.",

Outcomes of this project include the Schism real-time garbage collector and the FijiVM \u2013 a production VM for embedded systems. More recently, he worked on dynamic languages, trying to make sense of JavaScript and to design a new language called, Thorn. Nowadays, he spends his time with statisticians and data scientists. Jan believes that his 2012 election as Chair of SIGPLAN was an accident; since has been busy trying to rock the boat to ensure this does not happen again.

Essays is looking for clear and compelling pieces of writing about topics important to the software community.\nAn essay can be an exploration of a topic, its impact, or the circumstances of its creation; it can present a personal view of what is, explore a terrain, or lead the reader in an act of discovery; it can be a philosophical digression or a deep analysis. It can describe a personal journey, perhaps that by which the author reached an understanding of such a topic. The subject area should be interpreted broadly and can include the relationship of software to human endeavors, or its philosophical, sociological, psychological, historical, or anthropological underpinnings.\nOnward! Essays is reaching out not only to experienced academics but also to graduate students for constructive criticism of current software development technology and practices, and for the presentation of ideas that could change the realm of software development. Practitioners who are dissatisfied with the state of our art are also encouraged to share insights about how to reform software development, perhaps by presenting detailed examples of a new approach, demonstrating concrete benefits and potential risks.\nOnward! Essays is not looking for research-as-usual papers with rigorous validation (such as theorems or experiments). Onward! Essays accepts less rigorous methods of validation; however, regardless of its form or topic, the essay must have \u201cmeat\u201d.

Papers\nOnward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.\nThe Character of Onward!\nOnward! is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But Onward! is not looking for research-as-usual papers\u2014conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.\nOnward! is reaching out for constructive criticism of current software development technology and practices, and to present ideas that could change the realm of software development. Experienced researchers, graduate students, practitioners, and anyone else dissatisfied with the state of our art is encouraged to share insights about how to reform software development.\nOnward! welcomes your submissions to join the conversation for the good of our field.",

We are both interested in discovering how already known domains such as graph processing or machine learning can be best supported by DSLs, but also in exploring new domains that could be targeted by DSLs. More generally, we are interested in building a community that can drive forward the development of modern DSLs. \nWorkshop format\nDSLDI is a single-day workshop and will consist of a series of short talks whose main goal is to trigger exchange of opinion and discussions. The talks should be on the topics within DSLDI\u2019s area of interest, which include but are not limited to the following ones: \n \n DSL implementation techniques, including compiler-level and runtime-level solutions \n utilization of domain knowledge for driving optimizations of DSL implementations \n utilizing DSLs for managing parallelism and hardware heterogeneity \n DSL performance and scalability studies \n DSL tools, such as DSL editors and editor plugins, debuggers, refactoring tools, etc. \n applications of DSLs to existing as well as emerging domains, for example graph processing, image processing, machine learning, analytics, robotics, etc. \n practitioners reports, for example descriptions of DSL deployment in a real-life production setting",

      "Abstract": "The Fifth Workshop on Evaluation and Usability of Programming Languages and Tools (PLATEAU) at SPLASH 2014.\nTheme\nProgramming languages exist to enable programmers to develop software effectively. But how efficiently programmers can write software depends on the usability of the languages and tools that they develop with. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of languages and language tools. The supposed benefits of such languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to make them more safe and secure.\nPLATEAU gathers the intersection of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and human-computer interaction communities to share their research and discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools. \nSome particular areas of interest are: \n \n empirical studies of programming languages \n methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool evaluation \n software design metrics and their relations to the underlying language \n user studies of language features and software engineering tools \n visual techniques for understanding programming languages \n critical comparisons of programming paradigms \n tools to support evaluating programming languages \n psychology of programming \n\nAccepted papers now available\nDownload each paper by clicking on the event title in the program, pushing the \u201cview event page\u201d button, and clicking the file attachment link.

It calls for programming paradigms that, compared to current mainstream paradigms, would allow us to more naturally think about, design, develop, execute, debug, and profile systems exhibiting different degrees of concurrency, autonomy, decentralization of control, and physical distribution.\nAGERE! is an ACM SIGPLAN workshop dedicated to focusing on and developing the research on programming systems, languages and applications based on actors, agents and any related programming paradigm promoting a decentralized mindset in solving problems and in developing systems to implement such solutions.\nAll stages of software development are considered interesting for the workshop, including requirements, modeling, formalisation, prototyping, design, implementation, tooling, testing, and any other means of producing running software based on actors and agents as first-class abstractions. The scope of the workshop includes aspects that concern both the theory and the practice of design and programming using such paradigms, so as to bring together researchers working on models, languages and technologies, as well as practitioners using such technologies to develop real-world systems and applications.\nOfficial web site: http://soft.vub.ac.be/AGERE14",

Programming with Mobile and Touch (PROMOTO) is a forum for embracing the new realities of always-connected and/or touch-enabled devices. Topics under discussion will include cross-platform computing, cloud computing, social applications, privacy, and security. The challenges of new types of devices, such as large screens or gadgets with no screens, are very important.\nThemes and Goals\nToday, easy-to-use mobile devices like smartphones and tablets are becoming more prevalent than traditional PCs and laptops. New programming languages are emerging to enable programmers to develop software easily\u2014leveraging the exciting advances in existing hardware, and providing abstractions that fit the capabilities of target platforms with multiple sensors, touch and cloud capabilities. PROMOTO brings together researchers who have been exploring new programming paradigms, embracing the new realities of always connected, touch-enabled mobile devices. PROMOTO 2014 would like to invite contributions covering technical aspects of cross-platform computing, cloud computing, social applications and security. Submissions for this event are invited in the general area of mobile and touch-oriented programming languages and programming environments, and teaching of programming for mobile devices.\nApart from paper presentations, there will be ample time at PROMOTO to discuss the issues surrounding touch and mobile programming and to plan future directions.",

Papers\nOnward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.\nThe Character of Onward!\nOnward! is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But Onward! is not looking for research-as-usual papers\u2014conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.\nOnward! is reaching out for constructive criticism of current software development technology and practices, and to present ideas that could change the realm of software development. Experienced researchers, graduate students, practitioners, and anyone else dissatisfied with the state of our art is encouraged to share insights about how to reform software development.\nOnward! welcomes your submissions to join the conversation for the good of our field.",

      "Abstract": "Workshop on Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) at SPLASH 2014. \nDomain-Specific Modeling (DSM) provides a modern solution to demands for higher productivity by constricting the gap between problem and solution modeling. In the past, productivity gains have been sought from new programming languages. Domain-specific modeling languages provide a viable solution for continuing to raise the level of abstraction beyond coding, making development faster and easier.\nIn DSM, the models are constructed using concepts that represent things in the application domain, not concepts of a given programming language. The modeling language follows the domain abstractions and semantics, allowing developers to perceive themselves as working directly with domain concepts. The models represent simultaneously the design, implementation and documentation of the system. In a number of cases, the final products can be automatically generated from these high-level specifications with domain-specific code generators. This automation is possible because of domain-specificity: both the modeling language and code generators fit to the requirements of a narrowly defined domain, usually inside one organization only.\nSee the following web site for further information about DSM 2014: http://www.dsmforum.org/events/DSM14/",

But how efficiently programmers can write software depends on the usability of the languages and tools that they develop with. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of languages and language tools. The supposed benefits of such languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to make them more safe and secure.\nPLATEAU gathers the intersection of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and human-computer interaction communities to share their research and discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools. \nSome particular areas of interest are: \n \n empirical studies of programming languages \n methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool evaluation \n software design metrics and their relations to the underlying language \n user studies of language features and software engineering tools \n visual techniques for understanding programming languages \n critical comparisons of programming paradigms \n tools to support evaluating programming languages \n psychology of programming \n\nAccepted papers now available\nDownload each paper by clicking on the event title in the program, pushing the \u201cview event page\u201d button, and clicking the file attachment link.

We are both interested in discovering how already known domains such as graph processing or machine learning can be best supported by DSLs, but also in exploring new domains that could be targeted by DSLs. More generally, we are interested in building a community that can drive forward the development of modern DSLs. \nWorkshop format\nDSLDI is a single-day workshop and will consist of a series of short talks whose main goal is to trigger exchange of opinion and discussions. The talks should be on the topics within DSLDI\u2019s area of interest, which include but are not limited to the following ones: \n \n DSL implementation techniques, including compiler-level and runtime-level solutions \n utilization of domain knowledge for driving optimizations of DSL implementations \n utilizing DSLs for managing parallelism and hardware heterogeneity \n DSL performance and scalability studies \n DSL tools, such as DSL editors and editor plugins, debuggers, refactoring tools, etc. \n applications of DSLs to existing as well as emerging domains, for example graph processing, image processing, machine learning, analytics, robotics, etc. \n practitioners reports, for example descriptions of DSL deployment in a real-life production setting",

      "Abstract": "The Fifth Workshop on Evaluation and Usability of Programming Languages and Tools (PLATEAU) at SPLASH 2014.\nTheme\nProgramming languages exist to enable programmers to develop software effectively. But how efficiently programmers can write software depends on the usability of the languages and tools that they develop with. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of languages and language tools. The supposed benefits of such languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to make them more safe and secure.\nPLATEAU gathers the intersection of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and human-computer interaction communities to share their research and discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools. \nSome particular areas of interest are: \n \n empirical studies of programming languages \n methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool evaluation \n software design metrics and their relations to the underlying language \n user studies of language features and software engineering tools \n visual techniques for understanding programming languages \n critical comparisons of programming paradigms \n tools to support evaluating programming languages \n psychology of programming \n\nAccepted papers now available\nDownload each paper by clicking on the event title in the program, pushing the \u201cview event page\u201d button, and clicking the file attachment link.

      "Abstract": "Software tools and programming languages enable much of computing education. Many software experts are passionate about passing our craft along to others. Come interact with other educationally-minded software researchers during SPLASH: participate in SPLASH-E!\nSPLASH-E is a new (started in 2013) forum for software and languages (SE/PL) researchers with activities and interests around computing education. Some build pedagogically-oriented languages or tools; some think about pedagogic challenges around SE/PL courses; some bring computing to non-CS communities; some pursue human studies and educational research. At SPLASH-E, we share our educational ideas and challenges centered in software/languages, as well as our best ideas for advancing such work. Unlike general conferences on computing education, SPLASH-E strives to bring together researchers and those with educational interests that arise from Software ideas or concerns.\nSYMPOSIUM FORMAT: We will adopt a Q&amp;A format that fosters audience engagement and discussion. Each presentation will last 20 minutes. After the presentation, the audience will discuss the paper with those sitting around them for 2-3 minutes, trying to identify interesting issues or questions. The Q&amp;A then moves to the standard full-room format, with many questions arising from the discussion at the tables. This format has been used very successfully at ICER (the Computing Education Research conference).",

      "Abstract": "The Fifth Workshop on Evaluation and Usability of Programming Languages and Tools (PLATEAU) at SPLASH 2014.\nTheme\nProgramming languages exist to enable programmers to develop software effectively. But how efficiently programmers can write software depends on the usability of the languages and tools that they develop with. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of languages and language tools. The supposed benefits of such languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to make them more safe and secure.\nPLATEAU gathers the intersection of researchers in the programming language, programming tool, and human-computer interaction communities to share their research and discuss the future of evaluation and usability of programming languages and tools. \nSome particular areas of interest are: \n \n empirical studies of programming languages \n methodologies and philosophies behind language and tool evaluation \n software design metrics and their relations to the underlying language \n user studies of language features and software engineering tools \n visual techniques for understanding programming languages \n critical comparisons of programming paradigms \n tools to support evaluating programming languages \n psychology of programming \n\nAccepted papers now available\nDownload each paper by clicking on the event title in the program, pushing the \u201cview event page\u201d button, and clicking the file attachment link.

      "Abstract": "Workshop on Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) at SPLASH 2014. \nDomain-Specific Modeling (DSM) provides a modern solution to demands for higher productivity by constricting the gap between problem and solution modeling. In the past, productivity gains have been sought from new programming languages. Domain-specific modeling languages provide a viable solution for continuing to raise the level of abstraction beyond coding, making development faster and easier.\nIn DSM, the models are constructed using concepts that represent things in the application domain, not concepts of a given programming language. The modeling language follows the domain abstractions and semantics, allowing developers to perceive themselves as working directly with domain concepts. The models represent simultaneously the design, implementation and documentation of the system. In a number of cases, the final products can be automatically generated from these high-level specifications with domain-specific code generators. This automation is possible because of domain-specificity: both the modeling language and code generators fit to the requirements of a narrowly defined domain, usually inside one organization only.\nSee the following web site for further information about DSM 2014: http://www.dsmforum.org/events/DSM14/",

It calls for programming paradigms that, compared to current mainstream paradigms, would allow us to more naturally think about, design, develop, execute, debug, and profile systems exhibiting different degrees of concurrency, autonomy, decentralization of control, and physical distribution.\nAGERE! is an ACM SIGPLAN workshop dedicated to focusing on and developing the research on programming systems, languages and applications based on actors, agents and any related programming paradigm promoting a decentralized mindset in solving problems and in developing systems to implement such solutions.\nAll stages of software development are considered interesting for the workshop, including requirements, modeling, formalisation, prototyping, design, implementation, tooling, testing, and any other means of producing running software based on actors and agents as first-class abstractions. The scope of the workshop includes aspects that concern both the theory and the practice of design and programming using such paradigms, so as to bring together researchers working on models, languages and technologies, as well as practitioners using such technologies to develop real-world systems and applications.\nOfficial web site: http://soft.vub.ac.be/AGERE14",

Summer School runs from the afternoon of Friday, October 17 through the evening of Sunday, October 19. Integrated lecture-labs will form the basis of the coursework. Teaching assistants will be on-hand to help participants during the lab portions. The Summer School is held as a workshop and not run as an academic program; please be aware that no credit is available for the courses taken.\nThe following schedule is tentative and likely to change as the Summer School approaches. We reserve the right to make course substitutions and timing changes to fit the needs of our instructors and guest speakers. The dates of the school (17-19 October) will remain the same.\nAlthough snacks, tea and coffee will be provided, the participants are responsible for their own meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) using a wide selection of eating places within the walking distance.\nRegistration\nThe program is limited to 50 participants. The early registration deadline has been extended to October 6, 2014 and the fee is $100. Starting on October 7, the late registration fee will be $150. \nOnline registration is available through the OSU Markeplace. \nLocation\nThe workshop will be held on the Portland State University campus. Room 2500 B, 1900 SW 4th Ave, Portland State University\nDirections: Use the atrium entrance to the Engineering Building at 1930 SW 4th Avenue. Go down the stairs one level. From the bottom of the stairs, head NW out of the stairwell and along the corridor. Room 086-01 will be on your right.\n\nChanges from Previous Years\nTaking into account past feedback and changes in the nature and direction of multicore programming, we will be offering a curriculum more specific to Java and taught in greater depth than in past years.\nBecause of this, a strong familiarity with the Java language is absolutely required for those attending. We expect that you have at least two years of coding experience with Java. Those who have worked intensively with Java for less time than that may also qualify, but this knowledge is essential for success in the course. If you are inexperienced with Java programming, you will likely not be able to keep up with the pace of the course.\nParticipants should be prepared to code and work on the material on their own computers as a part of each class. Attendees should come with multicore laptops loaded with the required software, which will include Eclipse IDE, Java, VisualVM profiler tools, an open-source data race detector (several options will be given), and additional concurrency frameworks. A detailed list of the required software will be provided two weeks before the start of class.

We aim to advance the state of the art in different phases of parallel software development, covering software engineering aspects such as requirements engineering and software specification; design and implementation; program analysis, profiling and tuning; testing and debugging. \nGoals\nThe goal of the workshop is to present a stimulating environment where topics relevant to parallel software engineering can be discussed by members of the SPLASH community and software and languages researchers. The intention of the workshop is to initiate collaborations focused on solving challenges introduced by ongoing research in the parallel programming field. Through Q&amp;A sessions, presenters have the opportunity to receive feedback and opinions of other domain experts as well as to discuss obstacles and promising approaches in current research. Both authors and attendees can discover new ideas and directions to solve software engineering issues related to parallel programming. \nCall for Papers\nSpecific topics of interest include, but are not limited to: \n\n Process models for parallel software development\n Requirement engineering of parallel software\n Design and build of parallel programs\n Parallel design patterns\n Parallel software architectures\n Modeling techniques for parallel software\n Parallel programming models and paradigms\n Profiling and program analysis\n Dynamic and static analysis\n Refactoring and reengineering for parallelism\n Performance tuning and auto-tuning\n Energy-efficient parallel computing\n Testing and debugging of parallel applications\n Tools and environments for parallel software development\n Case studies and experience reports\n\n \nSubmission\nPapers submitted to SEPS 2014 must not have been published or simultaneously submitted anywhere else.
