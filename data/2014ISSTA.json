            "Abstract": "Multithreaded software systems effectively exploit multi-core and multi-processor machines. However developing reliable multithreaded software is extremely difficult, due to problems caused by unexpected interference between concurrent threads. Given their non-deterministic, scheduler-dependent nature, bugs caused by unintended thread interference are notoriously difficult to detect, reproduce, and eliminate. At the same time, their presence can have severe consequences. This talk explores dynamic analysis techniques to find concurrency errors in large-scale software systems, covering the theoretical underpinnings, implementation techniques, and reusable infrastructure used to build state-of-the-art analysis tools for verifying a variety of important concurrency properties, such as data race freedom, atomicity or serializability, and determinism.",

However, these efforts often ignore practical aspect such as usability and adoption. For development tools to be successful in practice they must provide sufficient value to developers for the amount of effort required to use them. In this talk we will discuss a number of technological and socialogical challenges to make testing tools work in development. The presentation will be based on our practical experience in developing and deploying static analysis technology to a large set of development organizations in various industries.",

            "Abstract": "We propose a new method for runtime prevention of type state violations in multithreaded applications due to erroneous thread interleavings. The new method employs a combination of static and dynamic program analysis techniques to control the execution order of the method calls to suppress illegal call sequences. The legal behavior of a shared object is specified by a type-state automaton, which serves as the guidance for our method to delay certain method calls at run time. Our main contribution is a new theoretical framework for ensuring that the runtime prevention strategy is always safe, i.e., they do not introduce new erroneous interleavings. Furthermore, whenever the static program analysis is precise enough, our method guarantees to steer the program to a failurefree interleaving as long as such interleaving exists. We have implemented the new method in a tool based on the LLVM compiler framework. Our experiments on a set of multithreaded C/C++ applications show that the method is both efficient and effective in suppressing concurrency related type-state violations.",

            "Abstract": "Developers of thread-safe classes struggle with two opposing goals. The class must be correct, which requires synchronizing concurrent accesses, and the class should provide reasonable performance, which is difficult to realize in the presence of unnecessary synchronization. Validating the performance of a thread-safe class is challenging because it requires diverse workloads that use the class, because existing performance analysis techniques focus on individual bottleneck methods, and because reliably measuring the performance of concurrent executions is difficult. This paper presents SpeedGun, an automatic performance regression testing technique for thread-safe classes. The key idea is to generate multi-threaded performance tests and to compare two versions of a class with each other. The analysis notifies developers when changing a thread-safe class significantly influences the performance of clients of this class. An evaluation with 113 pairs of classes from popular Java projects shows that the analysis effectively identifies 13 performance differences, including performance regressions that the respective developers were not aware of.",

            "Abstract": "We present a technique for automatically verifying atomicity of composed concurrent operations. The main observation behind our approach is that many composed concurrent operations which occur in practice are data-independent. That is, the control-flow of the composed operation does not depend on specific input values. While verifying data-independence is undecidable in the general case, we provide succint sufficient conditions that can be used to establish a composed operation as data-independent. We show that for the common case of concurrent maps, data-independence reduces the hard problem of verifying linearizability to a verification problem that can be solved efficiently with a bounded number of keys and values. We implemented our approach in a tool called VINE and evaluated it on all composed operations from 57 real-world applications (112 composed operations). We show that many composed operations (49 out of 112) are data-independent, and automatically verify 30 of them as linearizable and the rest 19 as having violations of linearizability that could be repaired and then subsequently automatically verified. Moreover, we show that the remaining 63 operations are not linearizable, thus indicating that data independence does not limit the expressiveness of writing realistic linearizable composed operations.",

The key idea in VART is to extend the use of test case executions from the conventional direct fault discovery to the generation of behavioral properties specific to the upgrade, by (i) automatically producing properties that are proved to hold for the base version of a program, (ii) automatically identifying and checking on the upgraded program only the properties that, according to the developers’ intention, must be preserved by the upgrade, and (iii) reporting the faults and the corresponding counter-examples that are not revealed by the regression tests. Our empirical study on both open source and industrial software systems shows that VART automatically produces properties that increase the effectiveness of testing by automatically detecting faults unnoticed by the existing regression test suites.",

            "Abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of detecting JavaScript security vulnerabilities in the client side of Web applications. Such vulnerabilities are becoming a source of growing concern due to the rapid migration of server-side business logic to the client side, combined with new JavaScript-backed Web technologies, such as AJAX and HTML5. Detection of client-side vulnerabilities is challenging given the dynamic and event-driven nature of JavaScript. We present a hybrid form of JavaScript analysis, which augments static analysis with (semi-)concrete information by applying partial evaluation to JavaScript functions according to dynamic data recorded by the Web crawler. The dynamic component rewrites the program per the enclosing HTML environment, and the static component then explores all possible behaviors of the partially evaluated program (while treating user-controlled aspects of the environment conservatively).  We have implemented this hybrid architecture as the JSA analysis tool, which is integrated into the IBM AppScan Standard Edition product. We formalize the static analysis and prove useful properties over it. We also tested the system across a set of 170,000 Web pages, comparing it with purely static and dynamic alternatives. The results provide conclusive evidence in favor of our hybrid approach. Only 10% of the reports by JSA are false alarms compared to 63% of the alarms flagged by its purely static counterpart, while not a single true warning is lost. This represents a reduction of 94% in false alarms. Compared with a commercial testing algorithm, JSA detects vulnerabilities in &gt;4x more Web sites with only 4 false alarms.",

            "Abstract": "Test adequacy criteria are fundamental in software testing. Among them, code coverage criterion is widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, in dynamic web application testing, merely covering server-side script code is inadequate because it neglects client-side execution, which plays an important role in triggering client-server interactions to reach important execution states. Similarly, a criterion aiming at covering the UI elements on client-side pages ignores the server-side execution, leading to insufficiency.  In this paper, we propose Virtual DOM (V-DOM) Coverage, a novel criterion, for effective web application testing. With static analysis, we first aggregate all the DOM objects that may be produced by a piece of server script to construct a V-DOM tree. The tree models execution on both the client- and server-sides such that V-DOM coverage is more effective than existing coverage criteria in web application testing. We conduct an empirical study on five real world dynamic web applications. We find that V-DOM tree can model much more DOM objects than a web crawling based technique. Test selection based on V-DOM tree criterion substantially outperforms the existing code coverage and UI element coverage, by detecting more faults.",

            "Abstract": "To assess the quality of web application test cases, web developers currently measure code coverage. Although code coverage has traditionally been a popular test adequacy criterion, we believe it alone is not adequate for assessing the quality of web application test cases. We propose a set of novel DOM-based test adequacy criteria for web applications. These criteria aim at measuring coverage at two granularity levels, (1) the percentage of DOM states and transitions covered in the total state space of the web application under test, and (2) the percentage of elements covered in each particular DOM state. We present a technique and tool, called DomCovery, which automatically extracts and measures the proposed adequacy criteria and generates a visual DOM coverage report. Our evaluation shows that there is no correlation between code coverage and DOM coverage. A controlled experiment illustrates that participants using DomCovery completed coverage related tasks 22% more accurately and 66% faster.",

            "Abstract": "With the emergence of new computing platforms, software written for traditional platforms is being re-targeted to reach the users on these new platforms. In particular, due to the proliferation of mobile computing devices, it is common practice for companies to build mobile-specific versions of their existing web applications to provide mobile users with a better experience. Because the differences between desktop and mobile versions of a web application are not only cosmetic, but can also include substantial rewrites of key components, it is not uncommon for these different versions to provide different sets of features. Whereas some of these differences are intentional, such as the addition of location-based features on mobile devices, others are not and can negatively affect the user experience, as confirmed by numerous user reports and complaints. Unfortunately, checking and maintaining the consistency of different versions of an application by hand is not only time consuming, but also error prone. To address this problem, and help developers in this difficult task, we propose an automated technique for matching features across different versions of a multi-platform web application. We implemented our technique in a tool, called FMAP, and used it to perform a preliminary empirical evaluation on nine real-world multi-platform web applications. The results of our evaluation are promising, as FMAP was able to correctly identify missing features between desktop and mobile versions of the web applications considered, as confirmed by our analysis of user reports and software fixes for these applications.",

While static data that can be mined directly from version control systems has been extensively studied, dynamic metrics concerning the execution of the software have received much less attention, due to the inherent difficulty of running and monitoring a large number of software versions. In this paper, we present Covrig, a flexible infrastructure that can be used to run each version of a system in isolation and collect static and dynamic software metrics, using a lightweight virtual machine environment that can be deployed on a cluster of local or cloud machines. We use Covrig to conduct an empirical study examining how code and tests co-evolve in six popular open-source systems. We report the main characteristics of software patches, analyse the evolution of program and patch coverage, assess the impact of nondeterminism on the execution of test suites, and investigate whether the coverage of code containing bugs and bug fixes is higher than average.",

            "Abstract": "Intuitively we know, some software errors are more complex than others. If the error can be fixed by changing one faulty statement, it is a simple error. The more substantial the fix must be, the more complex we consider the error.  In this work, we formally define and quantify the complexity of an error w.r.t. the complexity of the error&#039;s least complex, correct fix. As a concrete measure of complexity for such fixes, we introduce Cyclomatic Change Complexity which is inspired by existing program complexity metrics.  Moreover, we introduce CoREBench, a collection of 70 regression errors systematically extracted from several open-source C-projects and compare their complexity with that of the seeded errors in the two most popular error benchmarks, SIR and the Siemens Suite. We find that seeded errors are significantly less complex, i.e., require significantly less substantial fixes, compared to actual regression errors. For example, among the seeded errors more than 42% are simple compared to 8% among the actual ones. This is a concern for the external validity of studies based on seeded errors and we propose CoREBench for the controlled study of regression testing, debugging, and repair techniques.",

In C, this means that the API will not return negative values, corrupt memory, etc.  We instantiated this type system for Java’s Formatter API, and evaluated it on 6 large and well-maintained open-source projects. Format string bugs are common in practice (our type system found 104 bugs), and the annotation burden on the user of our type system is low (on average, for every bug found, only 1.0 annotations need to be written).",

            "Abstract": "Refactoring is an important way to improve the design of existing code. Identifying refactoring opportunities (i.e., code fragments that can be refactored) in large code bases is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel, automated and scalable technique for identifying cross-function refactoring opportunities that span more than one function (e.g., Extract Method and Inline Method). The key of our technique is the design of efficient vector inlining operations that emulate the effect of method inlining among code fragments, so that the problem of identifying cross-function refactoring can be reduced to the problem of finding similar vectors before and after inlining. We have implemented our technique in a prototype tool named ReDex which encodes Java programs to particular vectors. We have applied the tool to a large code base, 4.5 million lines of code, comprising of 200 bundle projects in the Eclipse ecosystem (e.g., Eclipse JDT, Eclipse PDE, Apache Commons, Hamcrest, etc.). Also, different from many other studies on detecting refactoring, ReDex only searches for code fragments that can be, but have not yet been, refactored in a way similar to some refactoring that happened in the code base. Our results show that ReDex can find 277 cross-function refactoring opportunities in 2 minutes, and 223 cases were labelled as true opportunities by users, and cover many categories of cross-function refactoring operations in classical refactoring books, such as Self Encapsulate Field, Decompose Conditional Expression, Hide Delegate, Preserve Whole Object, etc.",

            "Abstract": "The predictability of program execution provides attackers a rich source of knowledge who can exploit it to spy or remotely control the program. Moving target defense ad- dresses this issue by constantly switching between many di- verse variants of a program, which reduces the certainty that an attacker can have about the program execution. The ef- fectiveness of this approach relies on the availability of a large number of software variants that exhibit dierent ex- ecutions. However, current approaches rely on the natural diversity provided by o-the-shelf components, which is very limited. In this paper, we explore the automatic synthe- sis of large sets of program variants, called sosies. Sosies provide the same expected functionality as the original pro- gram, while exhibiting dierent executions. They are said to be computationally diverse. This work addresses two objectives: comparing dierent transformations for increasing the likelihood of sosie synthe- sis (densifying the search space for sosies); demonstrating computation diversity in synthesized sosies. We synthesized 30 184 sosies in total, for 9 large, real-world, open source ap- plications. For all these programs we identied one type of program analysis that systematically increases the density of sosies; we measured computation diversity for sosies of 3 programs and found diversity in method calls or data in more than 40% of sosies. This is a step towards controlled massive unpredictability of software.",

            "Abstract": "Scaling symbolic execution to large programs or programs with complex inputs remains difficult due to path explosion and complex constraints, as well as external method calls. Additionally, creating an effective test structure with symbolic inputs can be difficult. A popular symbolic execution strategy in practice is to perform symbolic execution not “from scratch” but based on existing test cases. This paper proposes that the effectiveness of this approach to symbolic execution can be enhanced by (1) reducing the size of seed test cases and (2) prioritizing seed test cases to maximize exploration efficiency. The proposed test case reduction strategy is based on a recently introduced generalization of delta debugging, and our prioritization techniques include novel methods that, for this purpose, can outperform some traditional regression testing algorithms. We show that applying these methods can significantly improve the effectiveness of symbolic execution based on existing test cases.",

            "Abstract": "A trend in software testing is reducing the size of a test suite while preserving its overall quality. Given a test suite and a set of requirements covered by the suite, test suite reduction aims at selecting a subset of test cases that cover the same set of requirements. Even though this problem has received considerable attention, finding the smallest subset of test cases is still challenging and commonly-used approaches address this problem only with approximated solutions. When executing a single test case requires much manual effort (e.g., hours of preparation), finding the minimal subset is needed to reduce the testing costs. In this paper, we introduce a radically new approach to test suite reduction, called FLOWER, based on a search among network maximum flows. From a given test suite and the requirements covered by the suite, FLOWER forms a flow network (with specific constraints) that is then traversed to find its maximum flows. FLOWER leverages the Ford-Fulkerson method to compute maximum flows and Constraint Programming techniques to search among optimal flows. FLOWER is an exact method that computes a minimum-sized test suite, preserving the coverage of requirements. The experimental results show that FLOWER outperforms a non-optimized implementation of the Integer Linear Programming approach by 15-3000 times in terms of the time needed to find an optimal solution, and a simple greedy approach by 5-15% in terms of the size of reduced test suite.",

While careful selection of input data is necessary to reach faulty states in a system under test, test oracles are needed to actually detect failures. In this work, we describe Dodona, a system that supports the generation of test oracles. Dodona ranks program variables based on the interactions and dependencies observed between them during program execution. Using this ranking, Dodona proposes a set of variables to be monitored, that can be used by engineers to construct assertion-based oracles. Our empirical study of Dodona reveals that it is more effective and efficient than the current state-of-the-art approach for generating oracle data sets, and can often yield oracles that are almost as effective as oracles hand-crafted by engineers without support.",

A crash report typically includes a call stack at the time of crash. An important step of debugging a crash is to identify faulty functions, which is often a tedious and labor-intensive task. In this paper, we propose CrashLocator, a method to locate faulty functions using the crash stack information in crash reports. It deduces possible crash traces (the failing execution traces that lead to crash) by expanding the crash stack with functions in static call graph. It then calculates the suspiciousness of each function in the approximate crash traces. The functions are then ranked by their suspiciousness scores and are recommended to developers for further investigation. We evaluate our approach using real-world Mozilla crash data. The results show that our approach is effective: we can locate 50.6%, 63.7% and 67.5% of crashing faults by examining top 1, 5 and 10 functions recommended by CrashLocator, respectively. Our approach outperforms the conventional stack-only methods significantly.",

            "Abstract": "Debugging is known to be a notoriously painstaking and time-consuming task. An essential and yet expensive process in debugging is bug isolation. As one major family of automatic bug isolation, statistical bug isolation approaches have been well studied in the past decade. A recent advancement in this area is the introduction of bug signature that provides contextual information to assist in debugging and several bug signature mining approaches have been reported. All these approaches instrument the entire buggy program to produce profiles for debugging. Consequently, they often incur hefty instrumentation and analysis cost. However, as in fact major part of the program code is error-free, full-scale program instrumentation is wasteful and unnecessary. In this paper, we devise a novel hierarchical instrumentation (HI) technique to perform selective instrumentation so as to enhance the efficiency of statistical debugging. We employ HI technique to predicated bug signature mining (called MPS) recently developed and propose an approach called HIMPS. The empirical study reveals that our technique can achieve around 40% to 60% saving in disk storage usage, time and memory consumption, and performs especially well on large programs. It greatly improves the efficiency of bug signature mining, making a step forward to painless debugging.",

We present an automated differential repair technique for input validation and sanitization functions. Differential repair can be used within an application to repair client and server-side code with respect to each other, or across applications in order to strengthen the validation and sanitization checks. Given a reference and a target function, our differential repair technique strengthens the validation and sanitization operations in the target function based on the reference function. It does this by synthesizing three patches: a validation, a length, and a sanitization patch. Our automated patch synthesis algorithms are based on forward and backward symbolic string analyses that use automata as a symbolic representation. Composition of the three automatically synthesized patches with the original target function results in the repaired function, which provides stronger validation and sanitization than both the target and the reference functions.",

            "Abstract": "Deadlock-freedom is a major challenge in developing multi-threaded programs, as a deadlock cannot be resolved until one restarts the program (mostly by using manual intervention). To avoid the risk of blocking, a program may use the trylock operations rather than lock operations. In this case, if a thread fails to acquire a lock using trylock, since trylock is non-blocking, the thread can release acquired locks to avoid a deadlock after trylock returns. Although this approach avoids deadlocks, it may also introduce bugs such as livelock and deadlivelock. Moreover, when such bugs are identified in a program, revising the program manually is error-prone.  With this motivation, in this paper, we propose an approach for avoiding deadlocks, livelocks and deadlivelocks in the given multi-threaded program. In our approach, we first identify cyclic lock dependencies that may lead to deadlocks, livelocks or deadlivelocks. Subsequently, we map the problem of ensuring freedom from deadlocks, livelocks and deadlivelocks to the weighted partial maximum satisfiability problem. To ensure that the repaired program preserves most of original design, our approach attempts to make minimal changes to the original program.",

DECAF exercises fine control over the TCG instructions to accomplish on-the-fly optimizations. We present 3 platform-neutral plugins - Instruction Tracer, Keylogger Detector, and API Tracer, to demonstrate the ease of use and effectiveness of DECAF in writing cross-platform and system-wide analysis tools. Implementation of DECAF consists of 9550 lines of C++ code and 10270 lines of C code and we evaluate DECAF using CPU2006 SPEC benchmarks and show average overhead of 605% for system wide tainting and 12% for VMI.",

            "Abstract": "A crucial problem in GUI testing is the identification of accurate event sequences that encode corresponding user interactions with the GUI. Ultimately, event sequences should be both feasible (i. e., executable on the GUI) and relevant (i.e., cover as much of the code as possible). So far, most work on GUI testing focused on approaches to generate feasible event sequences. In addition, based on event dependency analyses, a recently proposed static analysis approach systematically aims at selecting both relevant and feasible event sequences. However, statically analyzing event dependencies can cause the generation of a huge number of event sequences, leading to unmanageable GUI test suites that are not executable within reasonable time. In this paper we propose a refined static analysis approach based on program slicing. On the theoretical side, our approach identifies and eliminates redundant event sequences in GUI test suites. Redundant event sequences have the property that they are guaranteed to not affect the test effectiveness. On the practical side, we have implemented a slicing-based test suite reduction algorithm that approximatively identifies redundant event sequences. Our experiments on six open source GUI applications show that our reduction algorithm significantly reduces the size of GUI test suites. As a result, the overall execution time could significantly be reduced without losing test effectiveness.",

            "Abstract": "The number of smartphones shipped in 2014 will be four times larger than the number of PCs. Compared to PCs, smartphones have limited computing resources, and smartphone applications are more prone to performance problems. Traditionally, developers use profilers to detect performance problems by running applications with relatively large inputs. Unfortunately, for smartphone applications, the developer cannot easily control the input, because smartphone applications interact heavily with the environment.  Given a run on a small input, how can a developer detect performance problems that would occur for a run with large input? We present SUNCAT, a novel technique that helps developers understand and predict performance problems in smartphone applications. The developer runs the application using a common input, typically small, and SUNCAT presents a prioritized list of repetition patterns that summarize the current run plus additional information to help the developer understand how these patterns may grow in the future runs with large inputs. We implemented SUNCAT for Windows Phone systems and used it to understand the performance characteristics of 29 usage scenarios in 5 popular applications. We found one performance problem that was confirmed and fixed, four problems that were confirmed, one confirmed problem that was a duplicate of an older report, and three more potential performance problems that developers agree may be improved.",

            "Abstract": "Despite the seemingly obvious advantage of test automation, significant skepticism exists in the industry regarding its cost-benefit tradeoffs. Test scripts for web applications are fragile: even small changes in the page layout can break a number of tests, requiring the expense of re-automating them. Moreover, a test script created for one browser cannot be relied upon to run on a different web browser: it requires duplicate effort to create and maintain versions of tests for a variety of browsers. Because of these hidden costs, organizations often fall back to manual testing.  We present a fresh solution to the problem of test-script fragility. Often, the root cause of test-script fragility is that, to identify UI elements on a page, tools typically record some metadata that depends on the internal representation of the page in a browser. Our technique eliminates metadata almost entirely. Instead, it identifies UI elements relative to other prominent elements on the page. The core of our technique automatically identifies a series of contextual clues that unambiguously identify a UI element, without recording anything about the internal representation.  Empirical evidence shows that our technique is highly accurate in computing contextual clues, and outperforms existing techniques in its resilience to UI changes as well as browser changes.",

            "Abstract": "Mutation analysis evaluates a testing technique by measur- ing how well it detects seeded faults (mutants). Mutation analysis is hampered by inherent scalability problems — a test suite is executed for each of a large number of mutants. Despite numerous optimizations presented in the literature, this scalability issue remains, and this is one of the reasons why mutation analysis is hardly used in practice. Whereas most previous optimizations attempted to stati- cally reduce the number of executions or their computational overhead, this paper exploits information available only at run time to further reduce the number of executions. First, state infection conditions can reveal — with a single test execution of the unmutated program — which mutants would lead to a different state, thus avoiding unnecessary test executions. Second, determining whether an infected execution state propagates can further reduce the number of executions. Mutants that are embedded in compound expressions may infect the state locally without affecting the outcome of the compound expression. Third, those mutants that do infect the state can be partitioned based on the resulting infected state — if two mutants lead to the same infected state, only one needs to be executed as the result of the other can be inferred. We have implemented these optimizations in the Major mu- tation framework and empirically evaluated them on 14 open source programs. The optimizations reduced the mutation analysis time by 40% on average.",

To help developers detect information leaks before they can be leveraged by attackers, we present a new static analysis-based technique for detecting a specific type of information leak: information leaks via exceptions. Because it focuses on a specific type of leak, the technique is able to be efficient, effective, and easy to use, qualities that are often lacking in more general techniques. We implemented our technique in a prototype tool, UDLD, and performed an extensive empirical evaluation using 19 real web applications. The results of the evaluation show that UDLD is both efficient and effective at detecting unsafe information leaks via exceptions; for the subjects that we considered, UDLD is the fastest among several alternative tools. Moreover, it reported more true leaks than existing state-of-the-art tools with no known false negatives and no false positives.",

            "Abstract": "Integration of software from different sources is a critical activity in many embedded systems across most industry sectors. Software integrators are responsible for producing reliable systems that fulfil various functional and performance requirements. In many situations, these requirements inversely impact one another. In particular, embedded system integrators often need to make compromises regarding some of the functional system properties to optimize the use of various resources, such as CPU time. In this paper, motivated by challenges faced by industry, we introduce a multi-objective decision support approach to help balance the minimization of CPU time usage and the satisfaction of temporal constraints in automotive systems. We develop a multi-objective, search-based optimization algorithm, specifically designed to work for large search spaces, to identify optimal trade-off solutions fulfilling these two objectives. We evaluated our algorithm by applying it to a large automotive system. Our results show that our algorithm can find solutions that are very close to the estimated ideal optimal values, and further, it finds significantly better solutions than a random strategy while being faster. Finally, our approach efficiently identifies a large number of diverse solutions, helping domain experts and other stakeholders negotiate the solutions to reach an agreement.",

In this work, we introduce iDiscovery, a technique which leverages symbolic execution to improve the quality of dynamically discovered invariants computed by Daikon. Candidate invariants generated by Daikon are synthesized into assertions and instrumented onto the program. The instrumented code is executed symbolically to generate new test cases that are fed back to Daikon to help further refine the set of candidate invariants. This feedback loop is executed until a fix-point is reached. To mitigate the cost of symbolic execution, we present optimizations to prune the symbolic state space and to reduce the complexity of the generated path conditions. We also leverage recent advances in constraint solution reuse techniques to avoid computing results for the same constraints across iterations. Experimental results show that iDiscovery converges to a set of higher quality invariants compared to the initial set of candidate invariants in a small number of iterations.",

Testing such applications is hard, because they require realistic and coherent test inputs that are expensive to generate manually and difficult to synthesize automatically.

This paper presents Link, a technique to automatically generate test cases for applications that process complex data. The novel idea of Link is to exploit the Web of Data to generate test data that match the semantics of the related fields, and satisfy the semantic constraints that arise among interrelated fields. Link automatically analyzes the GUI of the application under test, generates a model of the required inputs, queries DBPedia to extract the data that can be used in the tests, and uses the extracted data to generate complex system test inputs.  The experimental results show that Link can generate realistic and coherent test inputs that can exercise behaviors difficult to exercise with currently available techniques.",

            "Abstract": "In a test suite, all the test cases should be independent: no test should affect any other test’s result, and running the tests in any order should produce the same test results. Techniques such as test prioritization generally assume that the tests in a suite are independent. Test dependence is a little-studied phenomenon. This paper presents five results related to test dependence.  First, we characterize the test dependence that arises in practice. We studied 96 real-world dependent tests from 5 issue tracking systems. Our study shows that test dependence can be hard for programmers to identify. It also shows that test dependence can cause non-trivial consequences, such as masking program faults and leading to spurious bug reports.  Second, we formally define test dependence in terms of test suites as ordered sequences of tests along with explicit environments in which these tests are executed. We formulate the problem of detecting dependent tests and prove that a useful special case is NP-complete.  Third, guided by the study of real-world dependent tests, we propose and compare four algorithms to detect dependent tests in a test suite.  Fourth, we applied our dependent test detection algorithms to 4 real-world programs and found dependent tests in each human-written and automatically-generated test suite.  Fifth, we empirically assessed the impact of dependent tests on five test prioritization techniques. Dependent tests affect the output of all five techniques; that is, the reordered suite fails even though the original suite did not.",

            "Abstract": "The reuse of software components is a common practice in commercial applications and increasingly appearing in safety critical systems as driven also by cost considerations. This practice puts dependability at risk, as differing operating conditions in different reuse scenarios may expose residual software faults in the components. Consequently, software fault injection techniques are used to assess how residual faults of reused software components may affect the system, and to identify appropriate counter-measures. As fault injection in components’ code suffers from a number of practical disadvantages, it is often replaced by error injection at the component interface level. However, it is still an open issue, whether such injected errors are actually representative of the effects of residual faults. To this end, we propose a method for analyzing how software faults turn into interface errors, with the ultimate aim of supporting more representative interface error injection experiments. Our analysis in the context of widely used software libraries reveals that existing interface error models are not suitable for emulating software faults, and provides useful insights for improving the representativeness of interface error injection.",

Automating these tests typically requires a behavior model: A description of the states the application can be in, the transitions between these states, and the expected results. Furthermore one needs scripts to make the abstract actions (transitions) in the model executable. However, specifying such behavior models and writing the necessary scripts manually is a hard task. We present ProCrawl (Process Crawler), a tool that automatically mines (extended) finite-state machines from (multi-user) web applications and generates executable test scripts. ProCrawl explores the behavior of the application by systematically generating program runs and observing changes on the application&#039;s user interface. The resulting models can be directly used for effective model-based testing, in particular regression testing.",

A major challenge is its scalability and precision on interprocedural analysis. The former limits the application to large programs. The latter may lead to many false alarms.  This paper presents a flexible, scalable and practical static bug detection tool, called Canalyze, for C programs. The flexibility is embodied in our modular design that supports different precision-level constraint solvers and interprocedural analyses. Based on these options, one can enable the less precise options to achieve a more scalable analysis or the more time-consuming options to perform a more precise analysis. Our tool is also practical to analyze real-world applications. It has been applied to some industry systems and open source programs like httpd, lighttpd, etc. And hundreds of newly found bugs were confirmed by the maintainers of our benchmarks.",

Mutation analysis is well- established in software engineering research but hardly used in practice due to inherent scalability problems and the lack of proper tool support. In response to those challenges, this paper presents Major, a framework for mutation analysis and fault seeding. Major provides a compiler-integrated mu- tator and a mutation analyzer for JUnit tests. Major implements a large set of optimizations to enable efficient and scalable mutation analysis of large software sys- tems. It has already been applied to programs with more than 200,000 lines of code and 150,000 mutants. Moreover, Major features its own domain specific language and is de- signed to be highly configurable to support fundamental re- search in software engineering. Due to its efficiency and flexibility, the Major mutation framework is suitable for the application of mutation analysis in research and practice.

            "Abstract": "Empirical studies in software testing research may not be comparable, reproducible, or characteristic of practice. One reason is that real bugs are too infrequently used in software testing research. Extracting and reproducing real bugs is challenging and as a result hand-seeded faults or mutants are commonly used as a substitute. This paper presents Defects4J, a database and extensible framework providing real bugs to enable reproducible studies in software testing research. The initial version of Defects4J contains 357 real bugs from 5 real-world open source pro- grams. Each real bug is accompanied by a comprehensive test suite that can expose (demonstrate) that bug. Defects4J is extensible and builds on top of each program’s version con- trol system. Once a program is configured in Defects4J, new bugs can be added to the database with little or no effort. Defects4J features a framework to easily access faulty and fixed program versions and corresponding test suites. This framework also provides a high-level interface to common tasks in software testing research, making it easy to con- duct and reproduce empirical studies. Defects4J is publicly available at http://defects4j.org.",

This paper presents the Format String Checker that is based on the format string type system presented in [3]. The Format String Checker guarantees that calls to Java’s Formatter API will not throw exceptions.  We evaluate the Format String Checker on 6 large and well-maintained open-source projects. Format string bugs are common in practice (we found 104 bugs), and the an- notation burden on the user of our type system is low (on average, for every bug found, only 1.0 annotations need to be written).",

In particular, we have released Pex4Fun (www.pexforfun.com) and its successor Code Hunt (www.codehunt.com) as web-based educational gaming environments for teaching and learning programming and software engineering. In Pex4Fun and Code Hunt, the main game type is a coding duel, where a player writes code in a method to achieve the same functionality as the secret method implementation, based on feedback provided by the underlying Pex tool. Players iteratively modify their code to match the functional behavior of the secret method. The scope of duels extends from the simplest one-line method to those including advanced concepts such as writing parameterized unit tests and code contracts. We have also used the game type for competitions with thousands of players, and have found that it differentiates well between beginners and top coders. This tool demonstration shows how coding duels in Pex4Fun and Code Hunt can be constructed and used in teaching and training programming and software engineering.",

Recent studies indicate that this problem can be mitigated by caching the proofs for the constraints that occur repeatedly during the analysis of the same or similar programs, showing preliminary evidence that this can result in significantly reducing the analysis time. My PhD research draws on this initial results and aims to bring the technology for storing and reusing constraint proofs at an entirely new stage of maturity. We believe that equivalent constraints occur frequently across programs, and aim to turn the problem of solving the constraints into a fast and reliable search over proofs shared among different projects and teams through distributed data stores.",

However, JavaScript is loosely typed, dynamic, and challenging to analyze and test. We propose an automated technique to generate regression test cases at two complementary levels: (1) individual JavaScript functions, and (2) DOM event sequences. Moreover, to assess the quality of the test cases we propose a mutation testing technique that leverages static and dynamic program analysis to guide the mutation generation process towards parts of the code that are error-prone or likely to influence the program&#039;s output.",

As one major family of automated debugging, statistical debugging approaches have been well investigated over the past decade to assist in debugging. All these approaches instrument the entire buggy program to produce execution profiles for debugging. Consequently, they often incur hefty instrumentation and analysis cost. However, as in fact major part of the program code is error-free, full-scale program instrumentation is wasteful and unnecessary. In this doctoral research, a novel hierarchical instrumentation (HI) technique is devised to perform selective instrumentation so as to make statistical debugging more efficient while upholding the debugging effectiveness. We apply HI to two different categories of statistical debugging: in-house and cooperative debugging. The experiments validate that HI can greatly improve the efficiency of debugging.",

This paper presents such an approach where local state transition models are built by iteratively searching the joint state space of communicating processes. The resulting local models contain less unreachable states, which would reduce false counter-examples for verifying local safety properties. Alternatively, more precise transition dependence relations can be extracted from these local models for more effective partial order reduction when the global state space is searched. The prototype of this approach has been implemented in an explicit model checker, and experimented on several concurrent examples. The initial results are encouraging.",

            "Abstract": "As asynchronous programming becomes more mainstream, program analyses capable of automatically uncovering programming errors are increasingly in demand. Since asynchronous program analysis is computationally costly, current approaches sacrifice completeness and focus on limited sets of asynchronous task schedules that are likely to expose programming errors. These approaches are based on parameterized task schedulers, each of which admits schedules which are variations of a default deterministic schedule. By increasing the parameter value, a larger variety of schedules is explored, at a higher cost. The efficacy of these approaches depends largely on the default deterministic scheduler on which varying schedules are fashioned.  We find that the limited exploration of asynchronous program behaviors can be made more efficient by designing parameterized schedulers which better match the inherent ordering of program events, e.g., arising from waiting for an asynchronous task to complete. We follow a reduction-based &quot;sequentialization&quot; approach to analyzing asynchronous programs, which leverages existing (sequential) program analysis tools by encoding asynchronous program executions, according to a particular scheduler, as the executions of a sequential program. Analysis based on our new scheduler comes at no greater computational cost, and provides strictly greater behavioral coverage than analysis based on existing parameterized schedulers; we validate these claims both conceptually, with complexity and behavioral-inclusion arguments, and empirically, by discovering actual reported bugs faster with smaller parameter values.",

Further, even if each node is completely deterministic, and the property is again a 1-index safety, parameterized verification cannot be solved via the cutoff method. Empirically, we show how to encode such applications as Array-Based Systems and verify them using existing model checkers. We demonstrate this approach on protocols for distributed mutual exclusion and collision avoidance.",

            "Abstract": "Conventional Bounded Software Model Checking tools generate a symbolic representation of all feasible executions of a program up to a predetermined bound. An insufficiently large bound results in missed bugs, and a subsequent increase of the bound necessitates the complete reconstruction of the instance and a restart of the underlying solver. Conversely, exceedingly large bounds result in prohibitively large decision problems, causing the verifier to run out of resources before it can provide a result.  We present an incremental approach to Bounded Software Model Checking, which enables increasing the bound without incurring the overhead of a restart. Further, we provide an LLVM-based open-source implementation which supports a wide range of incremental SMT solvers.  We compare our implementation to other traditional non-incremental software model checkers and show the advantages of performing incremental verification by analyzing the overhead incurred on a common suite of benchmarks.",

With the tool CPAchecker, this framework allows for an easy configuration and subsequent automatic execution of analysis procedures ranging from data-flow analysis to model checking. The focus of the tool CPAchecker is thus on analysis. In this paper, we study configurability from the point of view of software certification. Certification aims at providing (via a prior analysis) a certificate of correctness for a program which is (a) tamper-proof and (b) more efficient to check for validity than a full analysis. Here, we will show how, given an analysis instance of a CPA, to construct a corresponding sound certification instance, thereby arriving at configurable program certification. We report on experiments with certification based on different analysis techniques, and in particular explain which characteristics of an underlying analysis allow us to design an efficient (in the above (b) sense) certification procedure.",

Use of the GPU for this purpose, however, has only recently begun to be studied. We show how the 2012 multicore CPU-parallel state-space exploration algorithm of the SPIN model checker can be re-engineered to take advantage of the unique parallel-processing capabilities of the GPGPU architecture, and demonstrate how to overcome the non-trivial design obstacles presented by this task. Our preliminary results demonstrate significant performance improvements over the traditional sequential model checker for state spaces of appreciable size (&gt;10 million unique states).",

Its extension is motivated by an attempt to express in logic the counterexamples it can detect and relate them to bounded liveness. The original algorithm is based on parallel breadth-first search and piggybacking of accepting states that are deleted after counting a fixed number of transitions. The main improvement is obtained by renewing the counter of transitions when the same accepting states are visited in the negated property automaton. In addition, we describe piggybacking of multiple states in either sets (exact) or Bloom filters (lossy but conservative), and use of local searches that attempt to connect cycles fragmented among processing cores. Finally it is proved that accepting cycle detection is in NC in the size of the product automaton&#039;s entire state space, including unreachable states.",

Most research effort so far has focused on checking safety properties specified using trivial tree automata i.e. Buechi tree automata all of whose states are final. Building on our previous work, we present a higher-order model checker, TravMC2, which supports properties specified using alternating parity tree automata (or equivalently monadic second order logic).

Tools based on systematic exploration of a program state space employ partial order reduction to avoid redundant thread interleavings. The key idea is to make non-deterministic thread scheduling choices only at statements that read or modify the global state shared by multiple threads. We focus on the approach to partial order reduction used in tools such as Java Pathfinder (JPF), which construct the program state space on-the-fly, and therefore can use only information available in the current program state and execution history to identify statements that may be globally-relevant. In our previous work, we developed a field access analysis that provides information about fields that may be accessed during program execution, and used it in JPF for more precise identification of globally-relevant statements. We build upon that and propose a may-happen-before analysis that computes a sound approximation of the happens-before ordering. Partial order reduction techniques can use the happens-before ordering to detect pairs of globally-relevant field access statements that cannot be interleaved arbitrarily (due to thread synchronization), and based on that avoid making unnecessary thread scheduling choices. The may-happen-before analysis combines static analysis with knowledge of information available from the dynamic program state. Results of experiments with several Java programs show that usage of the may-happen-before analysis further improves the performance of JPF.",

Despite its maturity, JPF cannot be used to verify any realistic Java application without a nontrivial amount of work done by its user. One of the main limiting factors towards model checking such applications is handling native calls. JPF provides ways for users to handle such calls. However, those require modeling the behaviour of the native methods in Java which is labour intensive and hinders the uptake of JPF by developers. This paper presents our tool that extends JPF to address this problem. Our work alleviates this burden for users by automatically handling native calls. Our approach is based on delegating the execution of native calls from JPF to their original execution environment. We showcase our extension by applying it to a variety of simple yet realistic Java applications that JPF, without our extension, cannot handle.",

Think of pro- tocol procedures sharing parameters, arbitrarily interleaved or used as building blocks in more complex compound proce- dures. SPIN is a well established general purpose verification tool that has good support for modeling such systems. In contrast to specialized tools, SPIN lacks support for crypto- graphic primitives and intruder model which are necessary for checking security properties. We consider a special class of security protocols that fit well in the SPIN framework. Our modeling method is systematic, generic and efficient enough so that SPIN could find all the expected attacks on several of the classical key distribution protocols.",

            "Abstract": "We report on our work-in-progress into the use of reliability analysis to quantify information leaks. In recent work we have proposed a software reliability analysis technique that uses symbolic execution and model counting to quantify the probability of reaching designated program states, e.g. assert violations, under uncertainty conditions in the environment. The technique has many applications beyond reliability analysis, ranging from program understanding and debugging to analysis of cyber-physical systems. In this paper we report on a novel application of the technique, namely Quantitative Information Flow analysis (QIF). The goal of QIF is to measure information leakage of a program by using information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy or Renyi entropy. We exploit the model counting engine of the reliability analyzer over symbolic program paths, to compute an upper bound of the maximum leakage over all possible distributions of the confidential data.  We have implemented our approach into a prototype tool, called QILURA, and explore its effectiveness on a number of case studies.",

This paper presents a semi-decision procedure for checking unsatisfiability of formulas in a fragment of separation logic that includes points-to assertions (x |-&gt; y), acyclic-list-segment assertions (ls(x,y)), logical-and, logical-or, separating conjunction, and septraction (the DeMorgan-dual of separating implication). The fragment that we consider allows negation at leaves, and includes formulas that lie outside other separation-logic fragments considered in the literature.  The semi-decision procedure is designed using concepts from abstract interpretation. The procedure uses an abstract domain of shape graphs to represent a set of heap structures, and computes an abstraction that over-approximates the set of satisfying models of a given formula. If the over-approximation is empty, then the formula is unsatisfiable.  We have implemented the method, and evaluated it on a set of formulas taken from the literature. The implementation is able to establish the unsatisfiability of formulas that cannot be handled by previous approaches.",

Such properties can be represented using CTL+FO, a logic that allows mixing temporal and first-order quantification. Verifying that a program satisfies a CTL+FO property is a challenging problem that requires both temporal and data reasoning. Temporal quantifiers require discovery of invariants and ranking functions, while first-order quantifiers demand instantiation techniques. In this paper, we present a constraint-based method for proving CTL+FO properties automatically. Our method makes the interplay between the temporal and first-order quantification explicit in a constraint encoding that combines recursion and existential quantification. By integrating this constraint encoding with an off-the-shelf solver we obtain an automatic verifier for CTL+FO.",

However, writing such models correctly can be challenging for practitioners who may not be proficient in declarative programming, and their models themselves may be buggy. We introduce the foundations of a novel test automation framework, AUnit, which we envision for testing declarative models written in Alloy -- a first-order, relational language that is supported by its SAT-based analyzer. We take inspiration from the success of the family of xUnit frameworks that are used widely in practice for test automation, albeit for imperative or object-oriented programs. The key novelty of our work is to define a basis for unit testing for Alloy, specifically, to define the concepts of test case and coverage, and coverage criteria for declarative models. We reduce the problems of declarative test execution and coverage computation to evaluation without requiring SAT solving. Our vision is to blend how developers write unit tests in commonly used programming languages with how Alloy users formulate their models in Alloy, thereby facilitating the development and testing of Alloy models for both new Alloy users as well as experts. We illustrate our ideas using a small but complex Alloy model. While we focus on Alloy, our ideas generalize to other declarative languages (such as Z, B, ASM).",

Although they cannot achieve the scientific rigor of formal experiments, the results can provide sufficient information to help professionals judge if a specific technology being evaluated will benefit their organization. This paper reports on a case study done for evaluating and revisiting a recently introduced combinatorial testing methodology used for web application security purposes. It further reports on undertaken practical experiments thus strengthening the applicability of combinatorial testing to web application security testing.",

            "Abstract": "Performance testing in distributed environments is challenging. Specifically, the identification of performance issues and their root causes are time-consuming and complex tasks which heavily rely on expertise. To simplify these tasks, many researchers have been developing tools with built-in expertise. However limitations exist in these tools, such as managing huge volumes of distributed data, that prevent their efficient usage for performance testing of highly distributed environments. To address these limitations, this paper presents an adaptive framework to automate the usage of expert systems in performance testing. Our validation assessed the accuracy of the framework and the time savings that it brings to testers. The results proved the benefits of the framework by achieving a significant decrease in the time invested in performance analysis and testing.",

This paper is written to provide an approach to modeling mobile test environments based on a Mobile Test Environment Semantic Tree (MTE_ST). Based on this model, the paper discusses test complexity evaluation methods for test environment.

These software systems exhibit reactive and concurrent execution whose control requires carefully designed and implemented protocols. Traditional programming languages provide little support to specify and validate protocols. To address this gap, we have developed a domain-specific language called P for specification, implementation, and validation of protocols in asynchronous software. P is being used inside Microsoft in Windows and Windows Phone for developing device drivers; the USB device driver stack that ships with Windows and Windows Phone is implemented in P. In this talk, I will present the design and implementation of the language features and the systematic testing framework of P. I will also touch upon our current work extending P for programming fault-tolerant distributed services.",

A policy workflow is a set of conditionals where testing involves executing various paths in the workflow. As a workflow becomes more complex, manual writing of tests to cover various paths in the workflow can be laborious, time-consuming, and error prone. To address the preceding problem, we propose a framework for automated test generation to cover various paths in the policy workflow. The generated tests can be used to find faults in the policy workflow implementations. In addition, the generated tests can serve as regression tests to guard against the changes made to a back-end service or to policy workflow.",

            "Abstract": "Like shared-memory multi-threaded programs, event-driven programs are susceptible to non-deterministic errors that are hard to reproduce and debug. Mobile application platforms and the web require writing event-driven code, motivating the need for better tools to detect these types of errors. In the first part of this talk, we will show how techniques from data race detection for multi-threaded programs can be applied to detect these bugs, by defining an appropriate notion of a happens-before relation and memory accesses for the underlying platform. While extant data race detectors can be applied to event-driven programs based on the above, the pervasive use of ad hoc synchronization in such programs can lead a race detector to report too many false positives. Race detection for such programs also faces a scalability challenge, as a large number of short-running event handlers can overwhelm standard vector-clock-based techniques. We present a novel race detector EventRacer that addresses both of these challenges. We introduce race coverage, a systematic method for exposing ad hoc synchronization and other key races to the user, significantly reducing false positives. We also present an efficient connectivity algorithm that uses chain decomposition to dramatically decrease the overhead of vector clocks. We show that for client-side web applications, our techniques lead to large performance and precision improvements over state-of-the-art techniques.",

Examples of target events may include an uncaught exception, the invocation of a certain method, or the access to confidential information.We are working on a symbolic execution approach to probabilistic software analysis that first computes the conditions to reach the target event, and then tries to quantify the fraction of the input domain satisfying these conditions. Unlike past approaches, that were mostly performed at model level, and were thus only applicable to early software design stages or required explicit (and hard to maintain) abstraction from the code, our techniques are performed directly at the code level. Our techniques are built on top of the Symbolic PathFinder symbolic execution tool. We discuss applications to the analysis of Unmanned Aerial Systems developed at NASA Ames.",

            "Abstract": "Software hangs can be caused by expensive operations in responsive actions (such as time-consuming operations in UI threads). Some of the expensive operations depend on the input workloads, referred to as workload-dependent performance bottlenecks (WDPBs). WDPBs are usually caused by workload-dependent loops (i.e., WDPB loops) that contain relatively expensive operations. Traditional performance testing and single-execution profiling may not reveal WDPBs due to incorrect assumptions of workloads. To address these issues, we propose the Infer approach that predicts WDPB loops under large workloads via inferring iteration counts of WDPB loops using complexity models for the workload size. Infer incorporates a novel concept named context-sensitive delta inference that consists of two parts: temporal inference for inferring the complexity models of different program locations, and spatial inference for identifying WDPB loops as WDPB candidates. We conducted evaluations on two popular open-source GUI applications, and identified impactful WDPBs that caused 10 performance bugs.",

Performance bugs create poor user experience and affect the user-perceived software quality. Even expert programmers can introduce performance bugs, which have already caused serious and highly publicized incidents. Well tested commercial products such as Windows Explorer and Acrobat Reader are also affected by performance bugs. In this talk, we will discuss Toddler, SunCat, and Caramel, three novel techniques for automatically detecting and repairing performance bugs. Unlike profilers, which focus on methods that take a long time to execute, Toddler, SunCat, and Caramel focus on code and execution patterns that are indicative of common programming mistakes affecting performance. The additional information provided by these patterns enable Toddler, SunCat, and Caramel to have better results more automation, fewer false negatives, fewer false positives, automated repair---than profilers for the bugs Toddler, SunCat, and Caramel are designed to find. Toddler, SunCat, and Caramel employ novel dynamic and static analyses. Toddler, SunCat, and Caramel found over 150 previously unknown performance bugs in widely used Java, C/C++, and C# applications, including in mobile applications. Over 100 of these bugs have already been fixed by developers.",

            "Abstract": "Modern computing has entered the era of Big Data. Analyzing data from Twitter, Google, Facebook, Wikipedia, or the Human Genome Project requires the development of scalable platforms that can quickly extract useful information from an ocean of records collected from customers, clinical trial participants, program execution logs, or the Internet. Most of the existing Big Data applications, including Hadoop, Giraph, Hive, Pig, Mahout, or Hyracks are written managed, object-oriented languages such as Java. While the use of such languages simplifies development tasks, the (memory and execution) inefficiencies inherent in these languages can have large impact on the application performance and scalability. When object-orientation meets Big Data, performance problems are significantly magnified, making data-intensive computing systems fail to scale to large datasets. I will talk about several projects we are currently working on to scale Big Data applications by reducing the cost of a managed runtime. Particularly, I will talk about Facade, a compiler and runtime system we have developed to transform a Big Data application into an almost object-bounded application which has been shown to be much more efficient and scale to much larger datasets. I will also briefly mention two other projects, one attempting to provide a memory-oblivious programming model for developers to allow them to write a program without worrying about how to create threads and use memory, and second aiming to trim a big dataset with probabilistic guarantees to facilitate debugging/testing of a Big Data application.",

            "Abstract": "At a time when power-hungry data centers and cloud servers become increasingly prevalent, energy efficiency is looming as a first-class design goal for parallel computing. More established solutions to address this challenging problem come from innovations on parallel architectures and operating systems. In this talk, we bring in a new perspective into green parallel computing, improving energy efficiency at the level of programming language runtimes. Our concrete solution is Hermes, a work-stealing language runtime that favorably balances the trade-off between energy and performance. The key insight is that threads in a work-stealing environment -- thieves and victims have varying impacts on the overall program running time, and a coordination of their execution ``tempos&#039;&#039; can lead to energy efficiency with minimal performance loss. The centerpiece of Hermes is two complementary algorithms to coordinate thread tempo: a workpath-sensitive algorithm to determine tempo for each thread based on thief-victim relationships on the execution path, and a workload-sensitive algorithm to select appropriate tempo based on the size of work-stealing deques. On the highest level, Hermes can be viewed as a semantics-aware energy management strategy unifying the language runtime and the hardware, with the language runtime offering clues for judicious tempo settings, and the hardware physically enabling tempo adjustment through standard Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). Hermes is a joint work with Ph.D. student Haris Ribic.",

            "Abstract": "We present a fuzzing framework for Intents: the core IPC mechanism for intra- and inter-app communication in Android. Since intents lie at a trust boundary between apps, their correctness is important and thorough testing is warranted. The key challenge is to balance the tension between generating intents that applications expect, permitting deep penetration into application logic, and generating intents that trigger interesting bugs that have not been previously uncovered. Our work strikes this balance using a novel combination of static analysis and random test-case generation. Our intent fuzzer crashed dozens of Google core and top Google Play apps, resulting in app restarts or even in a complete OS reboot.",
