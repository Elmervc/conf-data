            "Abstract": "Tech startups typically approach requirements gathering differently from the process that is used to develop requirements in existing businesses and for existing products. Many of these startups operate in &quot;stealth mode&quot;, taking care to minimize the number of people with whom they share their innovative ideas. It&#039;s common for these startups to create a succession of early releases, and apply user feedback from those releases to evolve the features and functions of their products.  This talk describes various approaches used by tech startups to define product requirements, and contrasts those approaches with those used in more traditional requirements engineering activities.",

            "Abstract": "Properly protecting information is in all our best interests, but it is a complex undertaking. The fact that regulation is often written by non-technologists, introduces additional challenges and obstacles. Moreover, those who design systems that collect, store, and maintain sensitive information have an obligation to design systems holistically within this broader context of regulatory and legal compliance. There are questions that should be asked when developing new requirements for information systems. For example, how do we build systems to handle data that must be kept secure and private when relevant regulations tie your hands? When building a system that maintains health or financial records for a large number of people, what do we need to do to protect the information against theft and abuse, keep the information private, AND at the same time, satisfy all governing privacy/security laws and restrictions? Moreover, how do we know that we&#039;ve satisfied those laws? How do we monitor for compliance while ensuring that we&#039;re monitoring the right things? And, how do you accomplish all this in a way that can be expressed clearly to end-users and legislators (or auditors) so they can be confident you are doing the right things? We&#039;ve been working on technologies to make these tasks simpler, and in some senses, automatic. In this talk, I will describe some of the research that we have been conducting to address these problems.",

            "Abstract": "Gameplay requirements are central to game development. In the business context of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMOGs) where game companies’ revenues rely on players&#039; monthly subscriptions, gameplay is also recognized as the key to player retention. However, information on what gameplay requirements are and how practitioners &#039;engineer&#039; them in real life is scarce. This exploratory study investigates how practitioners developing MMOGs reason about gameplay requirements and handle them in their projects. 12 practitioners from three leading MMOGs-producing companies were interviewed and their gameplay requirements documents were reviewed. The study’s most important findings are that in MMOG projects: (1) gameplay requirements are co-created with players, (2) are perceived and treated by practitioners as sets of choices and consequences, (3) gameplay is endless within a MMOG, and while gameplay requirements do not support any game-end goal, they do support a level-end goal, (4) &#039;paper-prototyping&#039; and play-testing are pivotal to gameplay validation, (5) balancing the elements of the gameplay is an on-going task, perceived as the most difficult and labor-consuming, (6) gameplay happens both in-game and out-of-the game. We conclude with discussion on validity threats to our results and on implications for research and practice.",

            "Abstract": "Brain injuries (BI) are recognized as a major public health issue. Many therapists include commercial motion-based videogames in their therapy sessions to help make rehabilitation exercises fun and engaging. Our initial exploratory work exposed a need for tools to help therapists make evidence-based decisions when choosing commercial motion-games for their patients who have had a BI. Targeting this need, we are gathering requirements for a case-based recommender (CBR) system that will act as a decision tool for therapists. In this paper, we describe our ongoing work as a case study that illustrates our multi-method approach of requirement elicitation for the CBR system. Our approach is comprised of four overlapping steps: (1) interviews with therapists, (2) onsite observations of therapy game sessions, (3) diary studies in which therapists record detailed information about game sessions, and (4) a user study of a CBR prototype interface. Leveraging direct interaction with end users (i.e., therapists), this case study demonstrates requirements gathering techniques to address needs of a special population (i.e., therapists who work with patients who had BIs) in a specialized context (i.e., inpatient rehabilitation using motion-based video games).",

In this work, we report our experience and results of eliciting user requirements for a situation awareness indoor orientation system dedicated to the visually impaired. We elicited our initial system requirements through three different studies that focus on users along with orientation and mobility instructors. Also, we performed a knowledge elicitation through our studies to formulate our system’s situation awareness requirements.",

            "Abstract": "Requirements Engineering (RE) involves eliciting, understanding, and capturing system requirements, which naturally involves much uncertainty. During RE, analysts choose among alternative requirements, gradually narrowing down the system scope, and it is unlikely that all requirements uncertainties can be resolved before such decisions are made. There is a need for methods to support early requirements decision-making in the presence of uncertainty. We address this need by describing a novel technique for early decision-making and tradeoff analysis using goal models with uncertainty. The technique analyzes goal satisfaction over sets of models that can result from resolving uncertainty. Users make choices over possible analysis results, allowing our tool to find critical uncertainty reductions which must be resolved. An iterative methodology guides the resolution of uncertainties necessary to achieve desired levels of goal satisfaction, supporting trade-off analysis in the presence of uncertainty.",

            "Abstract": "Missing requirements are known to be among the major sources of software failure. Incompleteness often results from poor anticipation of what could go wrong with an over-ideal system. Obstacle analysis is a model-based, goal-anchored form of risk analysis aimed at identifying, assessing and resolving exceptional conditions that may obstruct the behavioral goals of the target system. The obstacle resolution step is obviously crucial as it should result in more adequate and more complete requirements. In contrast with obstacle identification and assessment, however, this step has little support beyond a palette of resolution operators encoding tactics for producing isolated countermeasures to single risks. In particular, there is no single clue to date as to where and how such countermeasures should be integrated within a more robust goal model.  To address this problem, the paper describes a systematic technique for integrating obstacle resolutions as countermeasure goals into goal models. The technique is shown to guarantee progress towards a complete goal model; it preserves the correctness of refinements in the overall model; and keeps the original, ideal model visible to avoid cluttering the latter with a combinatorial blow-up of exceptional cases. To allow for this, the goal specification language is slightly extended in order to capture exceptions to goals seperately and distinguish normal situations from exceptional ones. The proposed technique is evaluated on a non-trivial ambulance dispatching system.",

            "Abstract": "We address the challenge of requirements engineering for sociotechnical systems, wherein humans and organizations supported by technical artifacts such as software interact with one another. Traditional requirements models emphasize the goals of the stakeholders above their interactions. However, the participants in a sociotechnical system may not adopt the goals of the stakeholders involved in its specification. We motivate, Protos, a requirements engineering approach that gives prominence to the interactions of autonomous parties and specifies a sociotechnical system in terms of its participants&#039; social relationships, specifically, commitments. The participants can adopt any goal they like, a key basis for innovative behavior, as long as they interact according to the commitments. Protos describes an abstract requirements engineering process as a series of refinements that seek to satisfy stakeholder requirements by incrementally expanding a specification set and an assumption set, and reducing requirements until all requirements are accommodated. We demonstrate this process via the London Ambulance System described in the literature.",

            "Abstract": "Most systems and business processes in organizations need to comply with more than one law or regulation. Different regulations can partially overlap (e.g., one can be more detailed than the other) or even conflict with each other. In addition, one regulation can permit an action whereas the same action in another regulation might be mandatory or forbidden. In each of these cases, an organization needs to take different strategies. This paper presents an approach to handle different situations when comparing and attempting to comply with multiple regulations as part of a goal-oriented modeling framework named LEGAL-URN. This framework helps organizations find suitable trade-offs and priorities when complying with multiple regulations while at the same time trying to meet their own business objectives. The approach is illustrated with a case study involving a Canadian health care organization that must comply with four laws related to privacy, quality of care, freedom of information, and care consent.",

            "Abstract": "Software engineers build software systems in increasingly regulated environments, and must therefore ensure that software requirements accurately represent obligations described in laws and regulations. Prior research has shown that graduate-level software engineering students are not able to reliably determine whether software requirements meet or exceed their legal obligations and that professional software engineers are unable to accurately classify cross-references in legal texts. However, no research has determined whether software engineers are able to identify and classify important ambiguities in laws and regulations. Ambiguities in legal texts can make the difference between requirements compliance and non-compliance. Herein, we develop a ambiguity taxonomy based on software engineering, legal, and linguistic understandings of ambiguity. We examine how 17 technologists and policy analysts in a graduate-level course use this taxonomy to identify ambiguity in a legal text. We also examine the types of ambiguities they found and whether they believe those ambiguities should prevent software engineers from implementing software that complies with the legal text. Our research suggests that ambiguity is prevalent in legal texts. In 50 minutes of examination, participants in our case study identified on average 33.47 ambiguities in 104 lines of legal text using our ambiguity taxonomy as a guideline. Our analysis suggests (a) that participants used the taxonomy as intended: as a guide and (b) that the taxonomy provides adequate coverage (97.5%) of the ambiguities found in the legal text.",

            "Abstract": "Security is an increasingly important quality facet in modern information systems and needs to be retained. Due to a constantly changing environment, long-living software systems &quot;age&quot; not by wearing out, but by failing to keep up-to-date with their environment. The problem is that requirements engineers usually do not have a complete overview of the security-related knowledge necessary to retain security of long-living software systems. This includes security standards, principles and guidelines as well as reported security incidents. In this paper, we focus on the identification of known vulnerabilities (and their variations) in natural-language requirements by leveraging security knowledge. For this purpose, we present an integrative security knowledge model and a heuristic method to detect vulnerabilities in requirements based on reported security incidents. To support knowledge evolution, we further propose a method based on natural language analysis to refine and to adapt security knowledge. Our evaluation indicates that the proposed assessment approach detects vulnerable requirements more reliable than other methods (Bayes, SVM, k-NN). Thus, requirements engineers can react faster and more effectively to a changing environment that has an impact on the desired security level of the information system.",

            "Abstract": "Requirements-driven approaches provide an effective mechanism for self-adaptive systems by reasoning over their runtime requirements models to make adaptation decisions. However, such approaches usually assume that the relations among alternative behaviours, environmental parameters and requirements are clearly understood, which is often simply not true. Moreover, they do not consider the influence of the current behaviour of an executing system on adaptation decisions. In this paper, we propose an improved requirementsdriven self-adaptation approach that combines goal reasoning and case-based reasoning. In the approach, past experiences of successful adaptations are retained as adaptation cases, which are described by not only requirements violations and contexts, but also currently deployed behaviours. The approach does not depend on a set of original adaptation cases, but employs goal reasoning to provide adaptation solutions when no similar cases are available. And case-based reasoning is used to provide more precise adaptation decisions that better reflect the complex relations among requirements violations, contexts, and current behaviours by utilizing past experiences. Our experimental study with an online shopping benchmark shows that our approach outperforms both requirements-driven approach and case-based reasoning approach in terms of adaptation effectiveness and overall quality of the system.",

Organizations often create links in order to meet compliance requirements, but then fail to capitalize on the potential benefits of those links to provide support for activities such as impact analysis, test regression selection, and coverage analysis. One of the major adoption barriers is caused by the lack of accessibility to the underlying trace data and the lack of skills many project stakeholders have for formulating complex trace queries. To address these challenges we introduce TiQi, a natural language approach, which allows users to write or speak trace queries in their own words. TiQi includes a vocabulary and associated grammar learned from analyzing NL queries collected from trace practitioners. It is evaluated against trace queries gathered from trace practitioners for two different project environments.",

Manually establishing and maintaining such traces is a high-skill, labour-intensive job. It is often the case that the ideal person for the job also has other, highly critical tasks to take care of, so offering semi-automated support for the management of traces is an effective way of improving the efficiency of the whole development process. In this paper, we present a technique to exploit the information contained in previously defined traces, in order to facilitate the creation and ongoing maintenance of traces, as the requirements evolve. A case study on a reference dataset is employed to measure the effectiveness of the technique, compared to other proposals from the literature.",

Recent studies analyzed this feedback and found that it includes information useful for app developers, such as user requirements, ideas for improvements, user sentiments about specific features, and descriptions of experiences with these features. However, for many apps, the amount of reviews is too large to be processed manually and their quality varies largely. The star ratings are given to the whole app and developers do not have a mean to analyze the feedback for the single features.In this paper we propose an automated approach that helps developers filter,aggregate, and analyze user reviews. We use natural language processing techniques to identify fine-grained app features in the reviews. We then extract the user sentiments about the identified features and give them a general score across all reviews. Finally, we use topic modeling techniques to group fine-grained features into more meaningful high-level features. We evaluated our approach with 7 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and compared its results with a manually, peer-conducted analysis of the reviews. On average, our approach has a precision of 0.59 and a recall of 0.51. The extracted features were coherent and relevant to requirements evolution tasks. Our approach can help app developers to systematically analyze user opinions about single features and filter irrelevant reviews.",

To validate these new approaches, researchers rely on a small number of trained experts to perform a labor-intensive manual analysis of the text. The time and resources needed to conduct manual extraction, however, has limited the size of case studies and thus the generalizability of results. To begin to address this issue, we conducted three experiments to evaluate crowdsourcing a manual requirements extraction task to a larger number of untrained workers. In these experiments, we carefully balance worker payment and overall cost, as well as worker training and data quality to study the feasibility of distributing requirements extraction to the crowd. The task consists of extracting descriptions of data collection, sharing and usage requirements from privacy policies. We present results from two pilot studies and a third experiment to justify applying a task decomposition approach to requirements extraction. Our contributions include the task decomposition workflow and three metrics for measuring worker performance. The final evaluation shows a 60% reduction in the cost of manual extraction with a 16% increase in extraction coverage.",

            "Abstract": "Novel envisioned systems face the risk of rejection by their target user community and the requirements engineer must be sensitive to the factors that will determine acceptance or rejection. Conventionally, technology acceptance is determined by perceived usefulness and ease-of-use, but in some domains, other factors play an important role. In healthcare systems, particularly, ethical and emotional factors can be crucial. In this paper we describe an approach to requirements discovery that we developed for such systems. We describe how we have applied our approach to a novel system to passively monitor users for signs of cognitive decline consistent with the onset of dementia. A key challenge was eliciting users’ reactions to emotionally-charged events before they experienced them. Our goal was to understand the range of users’ emotional responses and their values and motivations, by a combination of manual and automated text analysis of interview transcripts. The analysis enabled formulation of requirements that would maximise the likelihood of acceptance of the system. The problem was heightened by the fact that the key stakeholders were elderly people who represent a poorly-studied user constituency. We discuss the elicitation and analysis methodologies used, and our experience with tool support. We conclude by reflecting on the issues affect for RE and for technology acceptance.",

            "Abstract": "Abstract: Natural language artifacts, such as requirements specifications, often explicitly state the security requirements for software systems. However, these artifacts may also imply additional security requirements that developers may overlook but should consider to strengthen the overall security of the system. The goal of this research is to aid requirements engineers in producing a more comprehensive and classified set of security requirements by (1) automatically identifying security-relevant sentences in natural language requirements artifacts, and (2) providing context-specific security requirements templates to help translate the security-relevant sentences into functional security requirements. Using machine learning techniques, we have developed a tool-assisted process that takes as input a set of natural language artifacts. Our process automatically identifies security-relevant sentences in the artifacts and classifies them according to the security objectives, either explicitly stated or implied by the sentences. We classified 10,963 sentences in six different documents from healthcare domain and extracted corresponding security objectives. Our manual analysis showed that 46% of the sentences were security-relevant. Of these, 28% explicitly mention security while 72% of the sentences are functional requirements with security implications. Using our tool, we correctly predict and classify 82% of the security objectives for all the sentences (precision). We identify 79% of all security objectives implied by the sentences within the documents (recall). Based on our analysis, we develop context-specific templates that can be instantiated into a set of functional security requirements by filling in key information from security-relevant sentences.

            "Abstract": "Security requirements patterns represent reusable security practices that software engineers can apply to improve security in their system. Reusing best practices that others have employed could have a number of benefits, such as decreasing the time spent in the requirements elicitation process or improving the quality of the product by reducing product failure risk. Pattern selection can be difficult due to the diversity of applicable patterns from which an analyst has to choose. The challenge is that identifying the most appropriate pattern for a situation can be cumbersome and time-consuming. We propose a new method that combines an inquiry-cycle based approach with the feature diagram notation to review only relevant patterns and quickly select the most appropriate patterns for the situation. Similar to patterns themselves, our approach captures expert knowledge to relate patterns based on decisions made by the pattern user. The resulting pattern hierarchies allow users to be guided through these decisions by questions, which introduce related patterns in order to help the pattern user select the most appropriate patterns for their situation, thus resulting in better requirement generation. We evaluate our approach using access control patterns in a pattern user study.",

            "Abstract": "Adaptive security systems aim to protect critical assets in the face of changes in their operational environment. We have argued that incorporating an explicit representation of the environment&#039;s topology enables reasoning on the location of assets being protected and the proximity of potentially harmful agents. This paper proposes to engineer topology aware adaptive security systems by identifying violations of security requirements that may be caused by topological changes, and selecting a set of security controls that prevent such violations. Our approach focuses on physical topologies; it maintains at runtime a live representation of the topology which is updated when assets or agents move, or when the structure of the physical space is altered. When the topology changes, we look ahead at a subset of the future system states. These states are reachable when the agents move within the physical space. If security requirements can be violated in future system states, a configuration of security controls is proactively applied to prevent the system from reaching those states. Thus, the system continuously adapts to topological stimuli, while maintaining requirements satisfaction. Security requirements are formally expressed using a propositional temporal logic, encoding spatial properties in Computation Tree Logic (CTL). The Ambient Calculus is used to represent the topology of the operational environment - including location of assets and agents - as well as to identify future system states that are reachable from the current one. The approach is demonstrated and evaluated using a substantive example concerned with physical access control.",

Such software ecosystems promise increased innovation power and support for consumer oriented software services at scale, and are characterized by a certain openness of their information flows. While such openness supports project and reputation management, it also brings some challenges to Requirements Engineering (RE) within the ecosystem. We report from a mixed-method study of IBM&#039;s CLM ecosystem that uses an open commercial development model. We analyzed data from from interviews within several ecosystem actors, participatory observation, and software repositories, to describe the flow of product requirements information through the ecosystem, how the open communication paradigm in software ecosystems provides opportunities for &#039;just-in-time&#039; RE, as well as some of the challenges faced when traditional requirements engineering approaches are applied within such an ecosystem. More importantly, we discuss two tradeoffs brought about the openness in software ecosystems: i) allowing open, transparent communication while keeping intellectual property confidential within the ecosystem, and ii) having the ability to act globally on a long-term strategy while empowering product teams to act locally to answer end-users&#039; context specific needs in a timely manner.",

The RISDM includes a meta-model and design process of RIS, PQM (Pragmatic Quality Model) of SRS, and a technique to generate inspection question set based on the PQM and PBR (Perspective-Based Reading). We have been applying the RIS designed by the proposed RISDM to more than 140 projects of a wide variety of software systems in NTT DATA for five years.

In this paper, we propose a jigsaw puzzle metaphor to make identified conflicts explicit as well as an associated method to utilise this metaphor during stakeholder meetings. The metaphor provides an easy to understand language for stakeholders from otherwise diverse backgrounds. It enables stakeholders to work with a well-understood concept - that of building a system from misshapen pieces. These characteristics foster communication and team work, which improve commitment of stakeholders in co-authoring of requirements and co-responsibility in conflict handling. The gamification of conflict resolution also promotes a relaxed environment, which in turn improves team cooperation and creativity. Our experience in three user studies demonstrates that the jigsaw puzzle indeed improves such co-responsibility and co-ownership when compared with typical text-based representations of requirements.

In many projects, quality-related requirements are either entirely lacking from the specification or intermingled with functional concerns. This makes it difficult for stakeholders to fully understand the quality concerns of the system and to evaluate their scope of impact. In this paper we present a data mining approach for automating the extraction and subsequent modeling of quality concerns from requirements, feature requests, and online forums. We extend our prior work in mining quality concerns from textual documents and apply a sequence of machine learning steps to detect quality-related requirements, generate goal graphs contextualized by project-level information, and ultimately to visualize the results.

            "Abstract": "An industrial experience of the use of a method for discovering customer requirements with which to configure an off-the-shelf software package for implementation is reported. The method uses an adapted form of product variability model to provide common ground between the customer and supplier about requirements and capabilities. An associated decision support software tool guides the supplier and customer through a model-based walkthrough to discover new requirements, based on equivalent capabilities described in the product variability model. We applied the method in the work processes of the commercial provider of a software-based learning management system, and collected quantitative and qualitative data from supplier-customer interactions. Our first experienc-es with the method led to an increased exposure and expression of customer requirements in the customer-supplier dialogue, compared to the baseline dialogue during software package demonstrations. The paper also reports some first lessons learned to improve the method and adopt its use with other software supplier organizations.",

There are some widely accepted estimation techniques: Function Points, Use Case Points and Cosmic Points, but these techniques can only be applied after the availability of a requirements specification. In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate the size of an application previous to its requirements specification by using the application language itself, captured by the Language Extended Lexicon (LEL). Our approach is based on Use Case Points and on a technique which derives Use Cases from the LEL. The proposed approach provides a measure of the application’s size earlier than the usual techniques, thus reducing the effort needed to apply them. An initial experiment was conducted to evaluate the proposal.",

Ideally, experts trained in law will analyze and interpret legal texts to inform the software requirements process. However, in small companies and development teams with short launch cycles, individuals with little or no legal training will be responsible for compliance. Two specific challenges commonly faced by non-experts are deciding if their system is covered by a law, and then deciding whether two legal requirements are similar or different. In this study, we assess the ability of laypersons, technical professionals, and legal experts to judge the similarity between legal coverage conditions and requirements. In so doing, we discovered that legal experts achieved higher rates of consensus more frequently than technical professionals or laypersons and that all groups had slightly greater agreement when judging coverage conditions than requirements, measured by Fleiss’ Κ. When comparing judgments between groups using a consensus-based Cohen’s Kappa, we found that technical professionals and legal experts exhibited consistently greater agreement than that found between laypersons and legal experts, and that each group tended towards different justifications, such as laypersons and technical professionals tendency towards categorizing different coverage conditions or requirements as equivalent if they believed them to possess the same underlying intent.",

This paper examines how system dynamics can be used in evaluating IT business value in a company level. We approach IT business value as a web of impacts, where benefits and sacrifices are ultimately evaluated against company earnings logic. This study is based on an action research and covers a pilot project within two co-operating companies. System dynamics was utilised to construct a value creation model for an existing Gaming Management System. This value creation modelling covered two dimensions: 1) structural evaluation of IT impacts with cause-and-effect models, 2) dynamic evaluation and simulation of value realisation over time. As a result, value creation modelling was able to provide a visual overview of how IT impacts were linked to business value through value paths, and how much and when value was realised. Value creation modelling enabled prototyping of value realisation that can provide value based insights for development activities like requirements elicitation and analysis. The examined approach proved its potential for providing a common language for technology and business parties, thus improving IT business alignment.

The language is compositional in that it allows (recursively) complex NFRs to be constructed in several ways. Importantly, the language allows the definition of requirements about the quality of fulfillment of other requirements, thus capturing, among others, the essence of probabilistic and fuzzy goals as proposed in the literature. We also offer a methodology for systematically refining informal NFRs elicited from stakeholders, resulting in unambiguous, de-idealized, and measurable requirements. The proposal is evaluated with a requirements dataset that includes 370 NFRs crossing 15 projects. The results suggest that our framework can adequately handle and clarify NFRs generated in practice.",

            "Abstract": "Quality requirements, an important class of non-functional requirements, are inherently difficult to elicit. Particularly challenging is the definition of good-enough quality. The problem cannot be avoided though, because hitting the right quality level is critical. Too little quality leads to churn for the software product. Excessive quality generates unnecessary cost and drains the resources of the operating platform. To address this problem, we propose to elicit the specific relationships between software quality levels and their impacts for given quality attributes and stakeholders. An understanding of each such relationship can then be used to specify the right level of quality by deciding about acceptable impacts. The quality-impact relationships can be used to design and dimension a software system appropriately and, in a second step, to develop service level agreements that allow re-use of the obtained knowledge of good-enough quality. This paper describes an approach to elicit such quality–impact relationships and to use them for specifying quality requirements. The approach has been applied with user representatives in requirements workshops and used for determining Quality of Service (QoS) requirements based the involved users’ Quality of Experience (QoE). The paper describes the approach in detail and reports early experiences from applying the approach.",

This tool demonstration focuses on recent extensions to jUCMNav that have incorporated feature models into a URN-based modeling and reasoning framework. Feature modeling is a well-establishing technique for capturing commonalities and variabilities of Software Product Lines. Combined with URN, it is possible to reason about the impact of feature configurations on stakeholder goals and system qualities, thus helping to identify the most appropriate features for a stakeholder. Furthermore, coordinated feature and goal model reasoning is fundamental to Concern-Driven Development, where concerns are defined with a three-part variation, customization, and usage interface. As the variation interface is described with feature and goal models, it is now possible with jUCMNav to define and reason about a concern’s variation interface, which is a prerequisite for composing multiple concerns based on their three-part interfaces.",

In this paper we present an Agile RE tool, Decisively, which brings a new perspective to automation in the RE process through application of QUADS to address Requirement Discovery, Analysis, Estimation and Prioritization. Techniques explored in Decisively include Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) for prioritization and estimation, Lorenz function to shortlist user stories by analyzing the distribution of votes, Box Plot Analysis to predict velocity, and Text Mining to discover implied requirements from documents.",

The models can be enriched with plenty of (detailed) information and their at least semi formal character even enables model driven approaches or direct execution in workflow engines. Validity of process models is crucial. Manual checking is expensive and error-prone, especially for requirements that regard the content level (e.g. compliance). To enable automated checking, an adequate method for formal specification is necessary. We present the Business Application Modeler (BAM), which is a modeling and Validation &amp; Verification tool that integrates modeling of processes and formal graphical validation rules. These rules can be automatically applied to process models. In particular, the modeler is supported by visualizations of checking results directly in the process models. Next to highlighting mechanisms this support includes recommendations for the correction of errors.",

However, in practice, several factors complicate performance requirements elicitation: lacking skills in performance requirements engineering, outdated or unavailable functional specifications and architecture models, the specification of the system&#039;s context, lack of experience to collect good performance requirements in an industrial setting with very limited time, etc. From the small set of available non-functional requirements engineering methods, no method exists that alone leads to precise and complete performance requirements with feasible effort and which has been reported to work in an industrial setting. In this paper, we present our experiences in combining existing requirements engineering methods into a performance requirements method called PROPRE. It has been designed to require no up-to-date system documentation and to be applicable with limited time and effort. We have successfully applied PROPRE in an industrial case study from the process automation domain. Our lessons learned show that the stakeholders gathered good performance requirements which now improve performance testing.",

Motivated by the knowledge reuse potentials when developing systems within the same domain, we studied business rules in a large software company. We interviewed 11 experienced practitioners on how they understand, capture, and use business rules. We also studied the role of business rules in requirements engineering in the host organization. We found that practitioners have a very broad perception for this term, ranging from flows of business processes to directives for calling external system interfaces. We identified 27 types of rules, which are typically captured as a free text in requirements documents and other project documentation. Practitioners stated the need to capture this tacit form of domain knowledge and to trace it to other artifacts as it impacts all activities in a software engineering project. We distill our results in 17 findings and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.",

We believe that the enrolment process is a major hurdle for e-government service adoption and badly designed processes might result in negative repercussions for both the policy maker and the different user groups involved; non-adoption and resentment are two risks that may result in low return on investment (ROI), lost political goodwill and ultimately a negative lived experience for citizens. Identity assurance requirements need to balance out the real value of the assets being secured (risk) with the user groups’ acceptance thresholds (based on a continuous cost-benefit exercise factoring in cognitive and physical workload). Sentire is a persona-centric requirements framework built on and extending the Volere requirements process with UX-analytics, reusable user behavioural models and simulated user feedback through calibrated personas. In this paper we present a story on how Sentire was adopted in the development of a national public-facing e-service. Daily journaling was used throughout the project and a custom built cloud-based CASE tool was used to manage the whole process. This paper outlines our experiences and lessons learnt.",

We investigate the impacts of their tightening partnership on software product management, with a focus on requirements engineering practices. We observe that the requirements definition and negotiation processes are directly affected by their fluid collaborative and competitive relationships. Power disputes, volatile roles and mismatches in release synchronisation are also aspects observed in the studied software ecosystem.

IT can also contribute to sustainable development, which goes beyond the energy consumed to produce and run the software product. Software is normally part of a wider context, social-technical systems, whose development can have a significant impact on the sustainability of its surroundings. A particular type of system with considerable sustainability impact are procurement systems. They normally affect the three pillars of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. This paper describes an experience on using goal modelling to incorporate sustainability into the procurement system of a large multinational energy company. The study highlights the advantages and challenges of introducing sustainability into private procurement systems, as well as the suitability of the technique for such a purpose. We believe this experience and its resulting model can be useful to other companies wishing to implement sustainable procurement processes.",

However, for critical systems there are gaps in state-of-the-art, and these can result in dire consequences, potentially putting lives in danger and damage infrastructure and threaten the environment. A well known technique used to help requirements engineers to understand safety hazards situations in the context of safety-critical software is Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). This technique is a good one to decompose hazards identified in the system context into events that may put the system functionalities in risk. However, FTA does not offer a protocol of how to derive safety functional requirements from fault trees. In this paper we present a case study adopting a protocol to help requirements engineers to derive safety functional requirements from FTA. The proposed protocol was based on a study performed in a Brazilian company in the area of electronic medical devices. The development of prototype of a low cost insulin infusion pump, which is a critical system, offered the basis to propose and test a protocol to derive safety functional requirements from FTA. During the case study we collected evidences that help us to discuss if FTA is sufficient to guide software engineers to implement the corresponding control software and also if FTA offers enough information to help requirements engineers to derive safety functional requirements.",

Tools and techniques to improve the quality of natural language requirements may give better results than attempts to convince industry to use something else. We have combined natural language requirements with tool support using boilerplates and domain ontologies, enabling detection of ambiguities and incompleteness in requirements. This paper reports on a case study where requirement analysts used the developed tool to analyze requirements for a safety-critical control system. The experience showed that people were able to use the tool to develop a domain ontology and apply boilerplates to describe requirements in a structured way, yielding requirements readable for humans and analyzable for the tool. The tool support improved the quality of requirements by reducing ambiguities and inconsistent use of terminology, removing redundant requirements, and improving partial and unclear requirements.",

Product variants can thus be configured by selecting different sets of features from the feature model. For feature-oriented requirements validation, the variability of feature sets often makes the hidden flaws such as behavioral inconsistencies of features, hardly to avoid. In this paper, we present an approach to feature-oriented requirements validation for automotive systems w.r.t both functional behaviors and non-functional properties. Our approach first starts with the behavioral specification of features and the associated requirements by following a restricted use case modeling approach, and then formalizes such specifications by using a formal yet literate language for analysis. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach through an industrial application of a vehicle locking-unlocking system.",

The success of a product-based business depends to a great extent on how efficiently and accurately the existing product knowledge is utilized for customization needs. Oftentimes however, product knowledge resides with few key individuals in an organization. In the absence of their involvement, project teams may redevelop product features unnecessarily, resulting in an effort overhead. Such overdependence poses a risk to projects. To identify the requirements for the variants accurately and efficiently, we need to have a thorough knowledge of the existing product features. In this paper, we discuss our work on representing product knowledge and reusing it in a Requirements Engineering (RE) exercise for a large project involving product customization. We present our experience from using the configurator for requirements gap analysis and customizations.",

The lack of support for formal modeling of requirements still represents an obstacle for the adoption of the formal methods in industry. This paper presents a case study that has been conducted in order to evaluate the difficulties inherent to the process of transforming the system requirements from their traditional written form into semi-formal notation. The case study focuses on a set of non-structured functional requirements for the Electrical and Electronic (E/E) systems inside heavy road vehicles, written in natural language, and reassesses the applicability of the extended Specification Pattern System (SPS) represented in a restricted English grammar. Correlating this experience with former studies, we observe that, as previously claimed, the concept of patterns is likely to be generally applicable for the automotive domain. Additionally, we have identified some potential difficulties in the transformation process, which were not reported by the previous studies and will be used as a basis for further research.",

However, well-known Requirements Engineering (RE) techniques lack of enough expressiveness to model the requirements of CSCW systems (Computer Supported Collaborative Work). This is due to the inherent complexity of collaboration among users and their need of awareness. Moreover, the way in which users interact with CSCW systems have evolved greatly to more sophisticated interfaces, beyond the classical desktop computer environments, to those called Post-WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer). Awareness is magnified in such a way that users have to be aware of their context: the artifacts with which to interact, his/her own capabilities as well as those of the others. All this awareness is necessary to allow them to collaborate in virtual and/or augmented environments. This PhD thesis aims at solving this problem by developing a RE framework able to deal with the requirements of CSCW and Post-WIMP systems, making emphasis on the awareness requirements about user’s context.",

            "Abstract": "Requirements engineering (RE) involves human-centric activities that require interaction among different stakeholders. Traditionally, RE has been considered as a centralized, collocated, and phase-specific process. However, in open-source software (OSS) development environment, the core RE activities are iterative and dynamic and follow a rather decentralized software engineering paradigm. This crosscutting characteristic of open-source RE can be conceptualized using the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; model that weaves RE together with software architecture. Although many weaving mechanisms have been proposed in recent years, lack of theoretical underpinning limits a mechanism&#039;s applicability and usefulness in different scenarios. In this research proposal, we hypothesize stakeholders&#039; social interaction as an ecologically valid weaving mechanism of the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in open-source RE. We further outline a concrete research plan to examine the generalizability of this weaving mechanism for three activities: requirements identification, requirements implementation, and creativity in RE. Carrying out this research plan will enable us to gain valuable insights to generate guidelines for enhancing software engineering practice in relevant areas.",

            "Abstract": "For analysts the alignment between the requirements and the available services presents a significant challenge in service oriented paradigm. To address this challenge various technical solutions have already been proposed. Although technical issues play an important role in this selection but organizational and social factors are equally as important in selecting an optimally aligned service for a specific requirement. The users of services are mostly ignored in the alignment process. User feedback analysis has recently gained a lot of research focus, but these benefits have not been fully explored and utilized in service oriented software development. In this paper I present a method for aligning services to requirements that is designed using the Situational Method Engineering approach and it incorporates user feedback about the services. This feedback assists the analysts in extracting required information for making informed decisions while selecting services among available options that satisfies both the user requirements and customer preferences. The method is supported by a proposed tool. The method and the supporting tool will be validated by a controlled experiment and focus group feedback from the practitioners.",

            "Abstract": "It is well recognized that most of the anomalies, discovered in the development of embedded real-time systems, belong to requirement and specification phases. To ease the situation, many efforts have been investigated into the area. For requirements development, especially requirements validation and verification, model-driven architecture techniques can be considered as a cost-efficient solution. In order to utilize such advantages, the design of the proposed system is often specified in terms of analyzable models at the certain level of abstraction. Further, different levels of requirements are translated into verifiable queries and fed into the models to be either validated or verified. For requirements management, requirements traceability provides critical support for performing change impact analysis, risk analysis, regression testing, etc. In this thesis, we cover several topics about requirements validation, requirements verification, and requirements traceability. In particular, the technical contributions are three-fold: 1) we propose an approach to requirements validation by using the extended Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language with newly defined TASM constructs and, 2) we present a simulation-based method which is powered up by statistical techniques to conduct requirements verification, working with industrial applications and, 3) we introduce an improved VSM-based requirements traceability recovery approach using a novel context analysis. Further, we have demonstrated the applicability of our contributions in real world usage through various case studies.",

Therefore business process and regulations compliance analysis audit and management tasks take a very important role in daily operational activities for each organization. Due to high complexity this task can become challenging. In some domains regulations are changing rapidly. Process models must be flexible and easy adjustable to changing requirements, since the lack of ability to comply with regulations can lower down the competitiveness of an organizations. Thus, rapid changes of regulations require rapid changes of related business processes. The goal of the PhD work is to develop business process and regulations compliance management technology which should enable business process construction from regulations and change monitoring of regulations and business processes to ensure easy and rapid modification of business process model or regulations, thus also ensuring compliance.",

            "Abstract": "Agile software development is getting more popular in research and practice. It is said to bring different advantages in contrast to traditional software development, especially when applied in small teams. Numerous studies have already shown evidence for these claims. But companies are not only using agile methods for small scale projects; nowadays agile methods are regularly used in complex distributed projects. Agility fosters the use of paper based media, which is a problem in distributed projects, because of the physical bonding of paper based media to a specific location. Whether a project is using agile or traditional software development methods: Distributed projects face many other problems, e.g. different participating companies, distributed team members, organizational and cultural differences. To narrow down this broad field of research, we have conducted a literature research and interview study. We found that a key challenge in distributed agile software development projects is insular thinking among the stakeholders. In practice, this hinders agile release planning in distributed work environments. Thus, we focus our research on how to break up insular thinking among the stakeholders of distributed agile projects. We believe that this can be possible through the targeted application of different virtual media in the agile process. For this reason we plan to develop a semantic model for distributed agile release planning. We intend to advance agile release planning in distributed work environments through the application of this model using virtual media. A software prototype will realize our model for distributed agile release planning in parts. The model will be evaluated by applying the prototype within a real project, observing and interviewing the project participants involved and analyzing the qualitative data obtained.",

The presented approach employs a graph-based modelling of the background knowledge of different readers, and uses a shortest-path search algorithm to model the pragmatic interpretation of a requirement. The comparison of different pragmatic interpretations is used to decide if a requirement is ambiguous or not.

Requirements engineering researchers seek innovative, effective means of addressing these problems. One powerful tool that can be added to the researcher toolkit is that of machine learning. Some researchers have been experimenting with their own implementations of machine learning algorithms or with those available as part of the Weka machine learning software suite. There are some shortcomings to using “one off” solutions. It is the position of the authors that many problems exist in requirements engineering that can be supported by Weka’s machine learning algorithms, specifically by classification trees. Further, the authors posit that adoption will be boosted if machine learning is easy to use and is integrated into requirements research tools, such as TraceLab. Toward that end, an initial concept validation of a component in TraceLab is presented that applies the Weka classification trees. The component is demonstrated on two different requirements engineering problems. Finally, insights gained on using the TraceLab Weka component on these two problems are offered.",

However, in recent evaluation experiments, users of the method (ontology verifiers) described only a few new rules based on rule grammars and rule examples. That led to the number of correctly detected errors were not so high (less than 50% of the total number of errors). To improve our method, in this paper, we propose a rules customization mechanism in which simple specific rules are generated using pre-defined and customizable meta-rules. We expect that by using the improvement, ontology verifiers can easily and effectively generate and customize rules for verification of requirements ontology. The customization mechanism is illustrated through examples and a case study.",

To support stakeholders in mastering these tasks there is an increasing interest in AI techniques. In this paper we presents two content-based recommendation approaches that support the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. First, we propose a Keyword Recommender to increase requirements reuse. Second, we define a thesaurus enhanced Dependency Recommender to help stakeholders finding complete and conflict-free requirements. Finally, we present studies conducted at the Graz University of Technology to evaluate the applicability of the proposed recommendation technologies.",

            "Abstract": "We describe an approach to the representation of requirements using answer set programming and how this leads to a vision for the role of artificial intelligence techniques in software engineering with a particular focus on adaptive business systems. We outline how the approach has developed over several years through a combination of commercial software development and artificial intelligence research, resulting in: (i) a metamodel that incorporates the notion of runtime requirements, (ii) a formal language for their representation and its supporting computational model (InstAL), and (iii) a software architecture that enables monitoring of distributed systems. The metamodel is the result of several years experience in the development of business systems for e-tailing, while InstAL and the runtime monitor is on-going research to support the specification, verification and application of normative frameworks in distributed intelligent systems. Our approach derives from the view that in order to build agile systems, the components need to be structured more like software that controls robots, in that it is designed to be relatively resilient in the face of a non-deterministic, dynamic, complex environment about which there is incomplete information. Thus, degrees of autonomy become a strength and an opportunity, but must somehow be constrained by informing these autonomous components what should be done in a certain situation or what system state ought to be achieved through norms as expressions of requirements. Because such a system made up of autonomous components is potentially behaviourally complex and not just complicated, it becomes essential to monitor both whether norms/requirements are being fulfilled and if not why not. Finally, because control over the system can be expressed through requirements in the form of data that can be changed, a route is opened to adjustment and dynamic re-direction of running systems.",

In this paper, we describe the application of data mining techniques in a case study of identifying contextual requirements for a context-aware mobile application to be used by a team of four long-distance rowers. The context of use for this application was dangerous and isolated, making it unobservable by the developers. The context situations for five mobile application requirements were defined by using a data mining algorithm applied to historical sensor data passively collected by the users while they crossed the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. The performance of the resulting classifiers is analyzed over time with promising results demonstrating that the data mining approach is feasible with implications for requirements engineering, context-aware mobile applications, and group-context-aware mobile applications.",

In each case, this provides a semantics for the notation, on which we can base the definition of forward (&quot;what if?&quot;) and backward (&quot;how is this achievable?&quot;) reasoning, of interest to requirements engineers. We consider the manner in which AI KR&amp;R research provides off-the-shelf algorithms that can be used to solve these tasks.

However, so far there have been no tertiary studies conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of these published SLR in RE. In this paper we present a tertiary study of SLR that focus solely on RE related topics by following the guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. We have conducted both automated search of major online sources and manual search of the RE and SLR related conferences and journals. Our tertiary study has identified 53 distinct systematic reviews published from 2006 to 2014 and reported in 64 publications. We have assessed the resulting SLR for their quality, and coverage of specific RE related topics thus identifying some gaps. We have observed that the quality of SLR in RE has been decreasing over the recent years. There is a strong need to replicate some of these SLR to increase the reliability of their results for future RE research.",

            "Abstract": "The rapid and worldwide diffusion of applications for smartphones (apps hereafter) has produced a complex ecosystem composed by users, apps, developers and vendors with sometimes contrasting and sometimes matching interests. In the literature, this ecosystem has been investigated from multiple perspectives with different kinds of empirical approaches, however some crucial dimensions are still unexplored. In this paper we adopt the perspective of Requirements Engineering. We are interested in collecting empirical observations on users&#039; perception of the risks associated to apps when they decide about which app to select and install on their smartphone. Which apps&#039; requirements do users consider? How do they evaluate them with respect to benefits, security and privacy risks? How users decide about this is still unclear. We think that relevant variables and underlying dynamics must be identified before we can successfully conduct large-scale controlled experiments, as it is already done in other fields of software engineering. This paper presents the design of an observational study proposed to explore how users assess features and costs/risks when installing apps. The experimental design is then validated and adopted in a feasibility study with a limited set of participants. Preliminary findings are summarised in a set of observations and then discussed in terms of their potential impacts on the app ecosystem.",

As instances of the methods we selected CORAS, a method by SINTEF used to provide security risk assessment consulting services, and SecRAM, a method by EUROCONTROL used to conduct security risk assessment within air traffic management. The experiment involved 29 MSc students who applied both methods to an application scenario from Smart Grid domain. The dependent variables were effectiveness of the methods measured as number of specific threats and security controls identified, and perception of the methods measured through post-task questionnaires based on the Technology Acceptance Model. The experiment shows that while there is no difference in the actual effectiveness of the two methods, the visual method is better perceived by the participants.",

Furthermore there is a shortage of empirical and comparative evaluations which can aid the software industry in this respect. This paper compares two security elicitation techniques – Misuse cases (MUC) and Issue based information systems (IBIS) by carrying out controlled experiments. A 2*2 factorial design was used with 30 undergraduate students selected randomly who solved security goal identification tasks on an individual basis using the two techniques. Two dependent variables chosen were; effectiveness of the techniques in terms of number of security goals identified and coverage of the techniques in terms of number of types of security goals, time taken to learn, execute and interpret results by each technique in three different situations. The main finding was that in a situation of low level of detail, the time taken to interpret results was lower in IBIS while in medium and high level of detail MUC is more effective for finding security goals and provides better coverage by taking less learning time. The generality of the results is limited due to the fact that undergraduate students participated in the experiment. The study provides guideline for the software industry about the choice of security elicitation technique in three different situations. The study can be extended by adding multiple techniques for comparison and a framework can be developed.",

Although some approaches have been developed to generate test cases from models, they require rigorous assessment of the completeness of the derivation rules. This paper proposes the plan and design of a controlled experiment that analyses a test case generation strategy for the purpose of evaluating its completeness from the viewpoint of those testers who will use a Communication Analysis-based requirements model. We will compare the abstract test cases obtained by applying (i) manual derivation without derivation rules with (ii) manual derivation with transformation rules; and both these strategies against a case of automated generation using transformation rules.",

However, few studies have explicitly concentrated on understanding collaborative creativity in RE, resulting in a lack of well-founded advice for practitioners on how to support this aspect of RE. Through an online survey, this paper seeks empirical validation for a framework of factors characterising collaborative creative processes in RE. Within the limits of the validity of the study, the results show support for the utility of the framework: collaborative creativity seems to be a linear function of the mean score to all factors in the framework. Factors can be grouped, and the specific impact of each group on collaboration, value and novelty can be assessed.",

Recently, this has been discussed more intensively for socio-technical systems, which offer a rich spectrum of different operating contexts. Contextual requirements proved valuable to model requirements together with the context they are valid in, but there is a lack of research on how to derive them from stakeholder needs. Our goal in this paper is to explore the usefulness of existing requirements elicitation techniques for the identification of contextual requirements early, i.e. at design time. In a case study we investigate end-user viewpoints, together with interviews, scenarios, prototyping, goal-based analysis, and groupwork as a means to elicit and clarify contextual requirements already at design time. In our case study a certain combination of the applied requirements elicitation techniques stood out as most beneficial for the identification of contextual requirements. In addition, we discovered valuable indicators of differences in the operative context, for example when end-users cannot agree on refinements of specific requirements. Designers and operators of adaptive systems might benefit by taking such conflicts and resulting contextual requirements into account.",

To understand the information needs of stakeholders we conducted two case studies and interviewed 6 stakeholders. We identified 26 unique information needs, which we represented as questions asked by stakeholders such as “Are there redundant requirements?” or “How did other stakeholders prioritize the requirements“. We grouped the needs into five situations in which they were encountered. These were defining, understanding, evaluating, negotiating, and planning requirements. We then surveyed 307 practitioners to quantify the frequencies of these needs and assess how well current tools satisfy them. About 60% of the respondents confirmed that they frequently encounter the needs while their tool support was poor or absent. Requirements engineers and experienced stakeholders were particularly unsatisfied with their tools. The largest gap between the importance of the information and the degree of tool support could be detected for information about the opinions of other stakeholders and conflicting preferences while understanding and negotiating requirements.",

However, a considerable proportion of outsourcing projects fail to materialize the anticipated results. The failure reasons are often traced back to Requirements Engineering (RE) processes. This establishes the importance of RE for software development outsourcing. We aim to help reducing RE issues in software development outsourcing by proposing a literature and empirically-based framework that maps RE issues to relevant best practices. We intend to perform a literature review, employ questionnaire-based surveys, and conduct semi-structured interviews with practitioners to identify RE issues and best practices to resolve these issues.

User feedback analysis has recently gained a lot of attention for its potential benefits in various areas of requirements engineering. The aim of this research is to evaluate the impact of feedback provided by the end users of the services, on the decision making process for the service selection. In this paper we present an empirical study that utilizes user feedback analysis for selection of a service among 92 available services with similar functionalities. The results show that in scenarios with significant number of services, it is helpful for analysts to consider additional information to select optimally best matched service to the requirements.",

            "Abstract": "Security issues can have a significant negative impact on the business or reputation of an organization. In most cases they are not identified in requirements and are not continuously monitored during software evolution. Therefore, the inability of a system to conform to regulations or its endangerment by new vulnerabilities is not recognized. In consequence, decisions related to security might not be taken at all or become obsolete quickly. But to evaluate efficiently whether an issue is already addressed appropriately, software engineers need explicit decision documentation. Often, such documentation is not performed due to high overhead. To cope with this problem, we propose to document decisions made to address security requirements. To lower the manual effort, information from heuristic analysis and end user monitoring is incorporated. The heuristic assessment method is used to identify security issues in given requirements automatically. This helps to uncover security decisions needed to mitigate those issues. We describe how the corresponding security knowledge for each issue can be incorporated into the decision documentation semiautomatically. In addition, violations of security requirements at runtime are monitored. We show how decisions related to those security requirements can be identified through the documentation and updated manually. Overall, our approach improves the quality and completeness of security decision documentation to support the engineering and evolution of security requirements.",

To improve the defensibility of these mitigations, several researchers have attempted to base risk assessment on argumentation structures. However, none of these approaches have so far been scalable or usable in real-world risk assessments.  In this paper, we present the results from our search for a scalable argumentation-based information security RA method. We start from previous work on both formal argumentation frameworks and informal argument structuring and try to find a promising middle ground. An initial prototype using spreadsheets is validated and iteratively improved via several Case Studies. Challenges such as scalability, quantify-ability, ease of use, and relation to existing work in parallel fields are discussed. Finally, we explore the scope and applicability of our approach with regard to various classes of Information Systems while also drawing more general conclusions on the role of argumentation in security.",

Instead of relying on requirements checklists, security experts rely on their expertise and background knowledge to identify security vulnerabilities. To understand the gap between available checklists and practice, we conducted a series of interviews to encode the decision-making process of security experts and novices during security requirements analysis. Participants were asked to analyze two types of artifacts: source code, and network diagrams for vulnerabilities and to apply a requirements checklist to mitigate some of those vulnerabilities. We framed our study using Situation Awareness—a cognitive theory from psychology—to elicit responses that we later analyzed using coding theory and grounded analysis. We report our preliminary results of analyzing two interviews that reveal possible decision-making patterns that could characterize how analysts perceive, comprehend and project future threats which leads them to decide upon requirements and their specifications, in addition, to how experts use assumptions to overcome ambiguity in specifications. Our goal is to build a model that researchers can use to evaluate their security requirements methods against how experts transition through different situation awareness levels in their decision-making process.",

            "Abstract": "Laws and regulations must be considered in the requirements engineering process in order to help ensure legal compliance when developing software or engineering systems. To incorporate legal compliance considerations into the requirements engineering process, we introduce a preliminary extension of the SQUARE methodology, called L-SQUARE. In this paper, we develop L-SQUARE by discussing legal compliance concerns at each of the traditional nine steps in SQUARE. Then, we link existing research in requirements engineering and the law to each step, emphasizing where compliance concerns can be addressed. This preliminary extension of SQUARE sets existing research into an established methodology for requirements engineering, creating a framework for situating current research in legal compliance, and identifying gaps for future work.",

In addition to the BUFD, at the end of the development, a security evaluation process can take up to several months. In today’s volatile markets customers want to influence the software design during the development process. Agile processes have proven to support these demands. Nevertheless, there is a clash with traditional security design and evaluation processes. In this paper, we propose an agile security evaluation method for the Common Criteria standard. This method is complemented by an implementation of a change detection analysis for model-based security requirements. This system facilitates the agile security evaluation process to a high degree.",

For cloud providers,one way to obtain customers’ confidence is to establish security mechanisms when using clouds. The ISO 27001 standard provides general concepts for establishing information security in an organization. Risk analysis is an essential part in the ISO 27001 standard for achieving information security. This standard, however, contains ambiguous descriptions. In addition, it does not stipulate any method to identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present a structured and pattern-based method to conduct risk analysis for cloud computing systems. It is tailored to SMEs. Our method addresses the requirements of the ISO 27001. We make use of the cloud system analysis pattern, security requirement patterns, threat patterns, and control patterns for conducting the risk analysis. The method is illustrated by a cloud logistics application example.",

After collecting experience in control engineering from a three year collaboration in the automotive domain, we conclude that innovation management is only weakly aligned with feature and platform development. This situation makes it difficult to assure feasibility of innovations and to identify potentials for innovations.  We present a novel approach to integrating innovation management with requirements and technology management by using behavioral system models. We investigate requirements-based and technology-based innovation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to using such models for managing feature and platform innovations in an automotive company.

However, current practices are pragmatic and subjective, which restricts benchmarking and reduces efficiency. In order to improve evolutionary practices, this paper proposes the Software Functionality Evolution Method (SFEM). The SFEM provides a software vendor with input for product roadmapping, by mapping functionality between software platforms. Mappings are based on characteristics and constraints of functionality, personas and software platforms. An incremental method engineering approach is put to practice, in which the template method is instantiated and improved over multiple cases. Cases show that the method contributes to efficient reasoning and strategic decision making in software evolution for software product managers.",

These processes require effective communication supported by high level architectural views. Our respondents, however, rely on simple methods due to their negative experiences with formalized models.

The project where one of the authors participated as a project member developed in-house software development support tools based on a software product line. In the development of a software product line, a project needs to evolve core assets in accordance with changes to the environment, the market, and technology. The concerns of stakeholders may also change the process of evolving core assets over the years, and even if stakeholders change, the concept of the target product line should be maintained. In order to effectively evolve core assets, it is important for the project to prepare and utilize a standardized method for prioritizing requirements. In this paper, we analyzed the evolution of core assets in relation to an actual project. Tacit knowledge for prioritizing requirements was extracted. Such knowledge was made explicit and defined to develop a method for prioritizing requirements. The method consists of the rules and processes for applying the rules. We also defined a meta-model for prioritizing requirements and incorporated the concept of the improvement of rules into the meta-model. According to the evaluation of the method, the following issues were clarified: (a) different stakeholders smoothly and efficiently reached agreement using the method, and (b) the method is effective for reducing lead time and costs for defining requirements.",

There are several means to visualize requirements stored in a database, but few ways in which the status of a requirement – such as at what stage of realization it is at a given point in time, its associated dependencies with other requirements, multi-directional traces, and so on – can be discerned at a glance, while simultaneously keeping the overall big picture in view. The ReBlock plug-in was conceptualized and prototyped in order to address these limitations. Here, we discuss the implementation of several extensions to the initial prototype of the plug-in that make it more adaptable for visualizing a larger number of requirements.",

The motivation for this approach was a response to ineffective projects that documented requirements in the traditional text format of “The system shall…”. In an attempt to both increase the quality of communication and fit with the rapid cycles of an agile-based project structure, a primarily graphical-based technique was used. The use of multiple models for the business requirements versus a single text document made communication across many business groups easier and decreased review time dramatically. The ISO RM-ODP standard was used to keep the focus of the business requirements models at the Enterprise, Information and Computation viewpoints. The use of multiple graphical models emulates the techniques of architects as they extract, document and present a building’s requirements. The graphical modeling-based formats and agile-based project techniques of this approach produced successful in-production solutions, which have been validated to FDA compliance standards.",

            "Abstract": "In any software project, different stakeholders participate in requirements elicitation process to identify the requirements of software. Stakeholder Identification (SI) is an important part of requirements elicitation process. Despite its importance, SI methods have received less attention by goal oriented requirements engineering (GORE) community. Goals are high level objective of an organization; and are the basis of GORE. In literature, we identify that goal oriented requirements elicitation process (GOREP) like knowledge acquisition for automated specification (KAOS), attributed goal oriented requirements analysis (AGORA), and goal oriented idea generation (GOIG) etc. do not support SI methods. Therefore, to address this issue, we present a method for SI in GOREP which includes the following steps: specify stakeholder types, specify stakeholder roles, selecting and classifying stakeholders using fuzzy based approach, and stakeholder’s analysis. Finally, the utilization of the proposed method is demonstrated with the help of an example.",

One could make a statement that serious negligence of any of the two will bring catastrophic consequences for the project, delays, failures and unhappy customers. Thus, alignment and cooperation between the two are not only recommended but highly required for contemporary complex software and system development. In this paper, we share some experiences from a large company that significantly downplayed requirements engineering activities while shifting the focus to testing and QA activities. Despite that, the company’s products are well received by its customers and the company remains profitable and significantly growing. We share our experiences and discuss how this unbalance may actually be a recipe for success and what contextual factors enable using this approach.",

If the activities involved in RET are not aligned, effort is inevitably wasted, and the probability of delivering high quality software products in time decreases. Previous work has identified sixteen challenges in aligning RET in a case study of six companies. However, all six case companies selected for the study are active in proprietary software engineering. In this experience report, we discuss to what extent the identified RET alignment challenges apply to the development of a large information system for managing grants from the European Union. We confirm that most of the findings from previous work also apply to the public sector, including the challenges of aligning goals within an organization, specifying high-quality requirements, and verifying quality aspects. Furthermore, we emphasize that the public sector might be impacted by shifting political power, and that several RET alignment challenges are amplified in multi-project environments.",

They often add the comment they are doing this by checking the software (application under test) against existing requirements. Its common sense that testers should be familiar with understanding and interpreting requirements. But when it comes to creation and review of requirements testers are usually not involved. Now, taking into consideration that many errors in software development are due to improperly defined requirements, one might wonder if integrating testers directly into the phase of requirements creation would be a promising option.",

            "Abstract": "Use case analysis is known to be an effective method to clarify functional requirements. Security requirements such as access or information control tend to increase the complexity of functional requirements, and therefore, need to be correctly implemented to minimize risks. However, general developers find it difficult to correctly specify adequate security requirements during the initial phases of the software development process. We propose a method to verify security requirements whose specifications are based on Unified Modeling Language (UML) using the model checking technique and Common Criteria security knowledge. Common Criteria assists in defining adequate security requirements in the form of a table. This helps developers verify whether UML-based requirements analysis models meet those requirements in the early stages of software development. The UML model and the table are transformed into a finite automaton in the UPPAAL model checking tool.",

            "Abstract": "In software development the code often must comply to a number of non-functional requirements, like architectural requirements. These requirements are often communicated and verified by writing guidelines and creating reports of the non-compliance. This way of communicating and verifying non-functional requirements is very costly since all developers needs to understand all requirements. It is also very hard for a developer to remember all requirements and it is easy to make mistakes. In software development much of the work is done in a tool-chain. The tool-chain contains tools like text editors, compilers, linkers, static analysis tools, automatic test frameworks etc. An alternative way to communicate and verify non-functional requirements is to add them to the tool-chain as automated tests and checkers, so the developers get fast automated feedback when they do mistakes. I have worked many years as a software architect defining and writing architectural requirements and my observations and experiences shows that the productivity is increased and number of non-compliant non-functional requirements is lower using the tool-chain feedback instead of using guidelines and reports.",

In this way, tests and requirements are linked together to find defects as soon as possible, which can considerably reduce the risk of defects and project reworking. The authors propose a generation strategy which consists of: two meta-models, a set of transformations rules which are used to generate a Test Model, and the Abstract Test Cases from an existing approach to communication-oriented Requirements Engineering; and an algorithm based on Breadth-First Search.

The application of using traditional methods such as model checking for the validation purpose is limited by the growing complexity of embedded real-time systems (ERTS). The observer-based technique is a lightweight validation technique, which has shown its potential as a means of validating the correctness of model behaviors. In this paper, the novelty of our contributions is three-fold: 1) we formally define the observer constructs for our formal specification language namely the Timed Abstract State Machine (TASM) language and, 2) we propose the Events Monitoring Logic (EvML) to facilitate the observer specification and, 3) we show how to execute observers to validate the requirements describing the functional behaviors and non-functional properties (such as timing) of ERTS. We also illustrate the applicability of the extended TASM language through an industrial application of a Vehicle Locking-Unlocking system.",

Efficiently incorporating usability and UCD into RE remains a challenge. In this paper we describe our experience with the introduction of a team role called &#039;On-site User Experience Consultant&#039; which supports integrating UCD activities tightly in agile RE. We name UCD activities and how they fit in our industrial projects. Also, we describe how old habits in communication and interaction have to change to establish UCD within the project team and with the clients.",

Steps taken for their digital inclusion, such as, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are often insufficient. In this paper we present initial requirements gathered during three workshops organized with various stakeholders coming from three different countries. Initial results suggest that the context of use and the cultural dimension play a crucial role in making digital content accessible for this community. Additionally, a one-solution-fits-all model is inadequate without considering levels of visual impairment when providing customized web and mobile experience. Finally, we lay out challenges that with comprehensive requirements gathering in the future, could address various problems that blind and visually impaired face.",

            "Abstract": "Extracting user requirements in designing innovative ICT based solutions for emerging vague problems is a challenge. We successfully addressed this challenge by blending several techniques in Software Engineering (SE) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) within a Design Science Research (DSR) framework. These techniques were traditional surveys and interviews, causal analysis, scenario creation and transformation, use of paper-based and functional prototypes for communicating with users and capturing their feedback, user centered design, and incremental development. This approach enabled us to better capture requirements based on usability aspects and guided us to design a successful solution. We present a framework derived from this research for wider applicability.",

However, engineering a system that can distinguish between voluntary and spontaneous blinks is difficult. The study analyzes trends in the occurrence of eyeblinks of 50 subjects to classify blink types via experiments. However, noticeable differences between voluntary and spontaneous blinks exist for each subject. Three types of trends based on shape feature parameters (duration and amplitude) of eyeblinks were discovered. This study determines that the system can automatically and effectively classify voluntary and spontaneous eyeblinks.",

            "Abstract": "Wireless technologies, cloud computing and connectivity have enabled mobile services that extend the coverage of health services, resulting in a branch of eHealth now commonly referred to as mHealth. However, at least in Sweden, where the healthcare sector is heavily institutionalized and regulated, mHealth has so far mainly evolved in the form of applications for support of healthy life-style and self-management of chronic diseases, implemented outside of the firewalls of traditional healthcare delivery environments. In this paper we present an on-going Indo-Swedish research and development project in which we are putting mHealth design into context both from a patient’s perspective and from the perspective of a healthcare team working within a professional healthcare organization. Our research approach is inspired by the Scandinavian tradition of Participatory Design of ICT and informed by studies of how to measure usability, user experience and impact of mHealth interventions. The involved research teams are multi-disciplinary, including researchers from engineering, computing and health sciences. The project includes, on the Swedish side, a partner from the public healthcare sector, three SME:s and an industrial partner who is currently providing Electronic Patient Record and other healthcare information system solutions and who is interested in developing mobile solutions for healthcare professionals. We are currently in the process of collaborative articulation and specification of problems, goals and requirements within the framework of the first Swedish case study of the project, focused on mobile support for patients with diabetes type 2 and their healthcare teams.",
