            "Abstract": "The recent and fast expansion of OSS (Open-source software) communities has fostered research on how open source projects evolve and how their communities interact. Several research studies show that the inflow of new developers plays an important role in the longevity and the success of OSS projects. Beside that they also discovered that an high percentage of newcomers tend to leave the project because of the socio-technical barriers they meet when they join the project. However, such research effort did not generate yet concrete results in support retention and training of project newcomers. In this thesis dissertation we investigated problems arising when newcomers join software projects, and possible solutions to support them. Specifically, we studied (i) how newcomers behave during development activities and how they interact with others developers with the aim at (ii) developing tools and/or techniques for supporting them during the integration in the development team. Thus, among the various recommenders, we defined (i) a tool able to suggest appropriate mentors to newcomers during the training stage; then, with the aim at supporting newcomers during program comprehension we defined other two recommenders: A tool that (ii) generates high quality source code summaries and another tool able to (iii) provide descriptions of specific source code elements. For future work, we plan to improve the proposed recommenders and to integrate other kind of recommenders to better support newcomers in OSS projects.",

            "Abstract": "Quality is a crucial property of any software system and consists of many aspects. On the one hand, quality measures how well a piece of software satisfies its functional requirements. On the other hand, it captures how easy it is to understand, test and modify a software system. While functional requirements are provided by the product owner, maintainability of software is often underestimated. Currently software quality is either assessed by experts, or presented as a list of rule violations reported by some kind of static analyzer. Both these approaches are working with a sense of quality outside of the software itself.  We envision quality as a first-class entity of a software system, a concept that similarly to the functionality is persistent within the software itself. We believe that each entity or a group of software entities should be able to tell about its quality, reasons of bad smells and ways to resolve them. This concept will allow to build quality aware tools for each step of the software development lifecycle.  On our way to the concept of quality as a first class entity, we have created a code review approach where software quality is the main concern. A reviewer makes decisions and takes actions based on the quality of the reviewed system. We plan to continue our research by integrating advanced quality rules into our tools and devising new approaches to represent quality and integrate it into everyday workflow. We started to develop a layer on top of a software model responsible for the quality feedback and allowing to develop quality-aware IDE plugins.",

            "Abstract": "Web application development uses many technologies and programming languages, both on the server side and on the client side. Maintaining the heterogeneous source code base is not easy, as each technology contains its own set of best practices and standards. Therefore, developers must be aware of diverse technologies&#039; and languages&#039; best practices, and quickly identify them in their codebases. To achieve that, we propose a set of detection strategies to automatically identify the presence (or ausence) of known bad web development practices. Our first implemented detection strategy enabled us to understand the feasibility of such work, and confirmed its usefulness for web developers.",

            "Abstract": "Modern software systems are increasingly configurable. Conditional compilation based on C preprocessor directives (i. e., #ifdefs) is a popular variability mechanism to implement this configurability in source code. Although C preprocessor usage has been subject to repeated criticism, with regard to variability implementation, there is no thorough understanding of which patterns are particularly harmful. Specifically, we lack empirical evidence of how frequently reputedly bad patterns occur in practice and which negative effect they have. For object-oriented software, in contrast, code smells are commonly used to describe source code that exhibits known design flaws, which negatively affect understandability or changeability. Established code smells, however, have no notion of variability. Consequently, they cannot characterize flawed patterns of variability implementation. The goal of my research is therefore to create a catalog of variability-aware code smells. I will collect empirical proof of how frequently these smells occur and what their negative impact is on understandability, changeability, and fault-proneness of affected code. Moreover, I will develop techniques to detect variability-aware code smells automatically and reliably.",

            "Abstract": "Refactoring is a key activity for any software system, as it ensures that the system is easily maintainable and extensible. However, complex refactorings (restructurings) are largely performed by hand, as there are no automated means of chaining existent basic refactorings. In addition, developers cannot quickly and safely evaluate the effects of a restructuring solution over another. In this context, we introduce a model- based approach to software refactoring, which provides an easy and safe way to explore restructuring alternatives. Restructurings are written as a composition of low-level model transformations, making them reusable in different complex refactorings. In order to support our approach, we implemented a tool named reFactor, which aims to bridge the gap between design flaw detection and correction. It detects design problems and offers a platform to compose model transformations into composite restructurings, while permanently monitoring the overall quality of the code.",

            "Abstract": "Developers often take much time and effort to find buggy program elements. To help developers debug, many past studies have proposed spectrum-based fault localization techniques. These techniques compare and contrast correct and faulty execution traces and highlight suspicious program elements. In this work, we propose constrained feature selection algorithms that we use to localize faults. Feature selection algorithms are commonly used to identify important features that are helpful for a classification task. By mapping an execution trace to a classification instance and a program element to a feature, we can transform fault localization to the feature selection problem. Unfortunately, existing feature selection algorithms do not perform too well, and we extend its performance by adding a constraint to the feature selection formulation based on a specific characteristic of the fault localization problem. We have performed experiments on a popular benchmark containing 154 faulty versions from 8 programs and demonstrate that several variants of our approach can outperform many fault localization techniques proposed in the literature. Using Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Cliff&#039;s d effect size, we also show that the improvements are both statistically significant and substantial.",

Most research in this area examines the developers’ prior development and bug-fixing activities in order to recognize their areas of expertise and assign to them relevant bug fixes. We propose a novel method that exploits a new source of evidence for the developers’ expertise, namely their contributions to Q&amp;A platforms such as Stack Overflow. We evaluated this method in the context of the 20 largest GitHub projects, considering 7144 bug reports. Our results demonstrate that our method exhibits superior accuracy to other state-of-theart methods, and that future bug-assignment algorithms should consider exploring other sources of expertise, beyond the project’s version-control system and bug tracker.",

            "Abstract": "In software evolution, many bugs occur and developers spend a long time to fix them. Program debugging is a costly and difficult task. Automated program repair is a promising way to reduce costs on program debugging dramatically. Several repair techniques reusing existing code lines have been proposed in the past. They reuse code lines already existing in the source code to generate variant source code of a given source code (if an inserted code line to fix a given bug is identical to any of the code lines in existing source code, we call the code line graftable). However, there are many bugs that such techniques cannot automatically repair. One of the reasons is that many bugs require code lines not existing in the source code of the software. In order to mitigate this issue, we are conducting our research with two ideas. The first idea is using a large dataset of source code to reuse code lines. The second idea is reusing only structures of code lines. Vocabularies are obtained from faulty code regions. In this paper, we report the feasibilities of the two ideas. More concretely, we found that the first and second ideas improved graftability of code lines to 43--59% and 56--64% from 34--54%, respectively. If we combine both the ideas, graftability was improved to 64--69%. In cases where we used the second idea, 24--49% variables used in reused code lines were able to be retrieved from the surrounding code of given faulty code regions.",

            "Abstract": "Constructing complex queries in SQL sometimes necessitates the use of language constructs and the invocation of internal functions which inexperienced developers find hard to comprehend or which are unknown to them. In the worst case, bad usage of these constructs might lead to errors, to ineffective queries, or hamper developers in their tasks. This paper presents a mining technique for Stack Overflow to identify error-prone patterns in SQL queries. Identifying such patterns can help developers to avoid the use of error-prone constructs, or if they have to use such constructs, the Stack Overflow posts can help them to properly utilize the language. Hence, our purpose is to provide the initial steps towards a recommendation system that supports developers in constructing SQL queries. Our current implementation supports the MySQL dialect, and Stack Overflow has over 300,000 questions tagged with the MySQL flag in its database. It provides a huge knowledge base where developers can ask questions about real problems. Our initial results indicate that our technique is indeed able to identify patterns among them.",

            "Abstract": "Refactoring source code requires preserving a certain level of semantic behaviors, which are difficult to be checked by IDEs. Therefore, IDEs generally check syntactic pre-conditions instead before applying refactoring, which are often too restrictive than checking semantic behaviors. On the other hand, there are pure functions in the source code that do not have observable side-effects, of which semantic behaviors are more easily to be checked. In this research, we propose purity-guided refactoring, which applies high-level refactoring such as memoization on pure functions that can be detected statically. By combining our purity analyzing tool purano with refactoring, we can ensure the preservation of semantic behaviors on these detected pure functions, which is impossible through previous refactoring operations provided by IDEs. As a case study of our approach, we applied memorization refactoring on several open-source software in Java. We observed improvements of the performance and preservation of semantics by profiling their bundled test cases.",

Coping with this problem involves extracting interfaces that satisfy the needs of the clients. In this paper, we envision an interface extraction method that serves a combination of four principles: (1) fitness, as the extracted interfaces have to fit the needs of the clients, (2) clarity, as the interfaces should not be cluttered with duplicated methods declarations due to clients&#039; similar needs, (3) flexibility, as it should be easy to maintain the extracted interfaces to cope with client changes, without affecting parts of the software that are not concerned by the changes, and (4) practicality, as the interface extraction should account for practical issues like the number of extracted interfaces, domain/developer specific constraints on what to include in the interfaces, etc. Our preliminary results show that it is feasible to extract interfaces by respecting the aforementioned principles. Moreover, our results reveal a number of open issues around the trading between fitness, clarity, flexibility and practicality.",

Most of these studies reuse existing sentiment analysis tools such as SentiStrength and NLTK. However, these tools have been trained on product reviews and movie reviews and, therefore, their results might not be applicable in the software engineering domain. In this paper we study whether the sentiment analysis tools agree with the sentiment recognized by human evaluators (as reported in an earlier study) as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the choice of a sentiment analysis tool on software engineering studies by conducting a simple study of differences in issue resolution times for positive, negative and neutral texts. We repeat the study for seven datasets (issue trackers and Stack Overflow questions) and different sentiment analysis tools and observe that the disagreement between the tools can lead to contradictory conclusions.",

However, there is no consensus in the literature on how to measure productivity or developer contribution. While some repository mining-based metrics have been proposed, they lack validation in terms of their applicability and usefulness from the individuals who will use them to assess developer contribution: team and project leaders. In this paper, we propose the design of a suite of metrics for the assessment of developer contribution, based on empirical evidence obtained from project and team leaders. In a preliminary evaluation with four software development teams, we found that code contribution and code complexity metrics received the most positive feedback, while participants pointed out several threats of using bug-related metrics for contribution assessment. None of the metrics can be used in isolation, and project leaders and developers need to be aware of the benefits, limitations, and threats of each one. These findings present a first step towards the design of a larger suite of metrics as well as an investigation into the impact of using metrics to assess contribution.",

            "Abstract": "Abstract—Twitter is a popular means to disseminate information and currently more than 300 million people are using it actively. Software engineers are no exception; Singer et al. have shown that many developers use Twitter to stay current with recent technological trends. At various time points, many users are posting microblogs (i.e., tweets) about the same topic in Twitter. We refer to this reasonably large set of topically-coherent microblogs in the Twitter space made at a particular point in time as an event. In this work, we perform an exploratory study on software engineering related events in Twitter. We collect a large set of Twitter messages over a period of 8 months that are made by 79,768 Twitter users and filter them by five programming language keywords. We then run a state-of-the-art Twitter event detection algorithm borrowed from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. Next, using the open coding procedure, we manually analyze 1,000 events that are identified by the NLP tool, and create eleven categories of events (10 main categories + “others”). We find that external resource sharing, technical discussion, and software product updates are the “hottest” categories. These findings shed light on hot topics in Twitter that are interesting to many people and they provide guidance to future Twitter analytics studies that develop automated solutions to help users find fresh, relevant, and interesting pieces of information from Twitter stream to keep developers up-to-date with recent trends.",

Relative to n-gram models, deep learning models can capture more complex statistical patterns based on smaller training corpora. In this paper we explore the use of a particular deep learning model, document vectors (DVs), for feature location. DVs seem well suited to use with source code, because they both capture the influence of context on each term in a corpus and map terms into a continuous semantic space that encodes semantic relationships such as synonymy. We present preliminary results that show that a feature location technique (FLT) based on DVs can outperform an analogous FLT based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and then suggest several directions for future work on the use of deep learning models to improve developer effectiveness in feature location.",

            "Abstract": "An approach to automatically generate natural language documentation summaries for C++ methods is presented. The approach uses prior work by the authors on stereotyping methods along with the source code analysis framework srcML. First, each method is automatically assigned a stereotype(s) based on static analysis and a set of heuristics. Then, the approach uses the stereotype information, static analysis, and predefined templates to generate a natural-language summary for each method. This summary is automatically added to the code base as a comment for each method. The predefined templates are designed to produce a generic summary for specific method stereotypes. Static analysis is used to extract internal details about the method (e.g., parameters, local variables, calls, etc.). This information is used to specialize the generated summaries.",

            "Abstract": "Reconstructing architectural components from existing software applications is an important task during the software maintenance cycle because either those elements do not exist or are outdated. Reverse engineering techniques are used to reduce the effort demanded during the reconstruction. Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted technique to retrieve software components from source code. Moreover, in several architectural descriptions of systems, a set of architecturally relevant classes are used to represent the set of architectural components. Based on this fact, we propose Keecle, a novel dynamic analysis approach for the detection of such classes from execution traces in a semi-automatic manner. Several mechanisms are applied to reduce the size of traces, and finally the reduced set of key classes is identified using Naïve Bayes classification. We evaluated the approach with two open source systems, in order to assess if the encountered classes map to the actual architectural classes defined in the documentation of those respective systems. The results were analyzed in terms of precision and recall, and suggest that the proposed approach is effective for revealing key classes that conceptualize architectural components, outperforming a state-of-the-art approach.",

Package management and build systems result in software ecosystems that usually are syntactically and semantically incompatible with each other, although the described software can overlap. There is currently no general way for querying software interrelationships across these different ecosystems. In this paper, we present our approach to combine and consequently query information about software interrelationships across different ecosystems. We propose an ontology for the semantic modeling of the relationships as linked data. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal storage and query model to handle inconsistencies between different data sources. By providing a scalable and extensible architecture to retrieve and process data from multiple repositories, we establish a foundation for ongoing research activities. We evaluated our approach by integrating the data of several ecosystems and demonstrated its usefulness by creating tools for vulnerability notification and license violation detection.",

In this paper, we propose a method called the Connecting Links Method (CLM) to recover transitive traceability links between two artifacts using a third artifact. Because CLM uses a different artifact as a document, it can be applied to kinds of various data. Basically, CLM recovers traceability links using the Vector Space Model (VSM) in Information Retrieval (IR) methods. For example, by connecting links between A and B and between B and C, CLM retrieves the link between A and C transitively. In this way, CLM can recover transitive traceability links when a suggested method cannot. Here we demonstrate that CLM can effectively recover links that VSM is hard using Open Source Software.",

It runs separately, e.g., on a tablet, beside an integrated development environment. Within the visualization, developers are able to arbitrarily change the object state, then invoke any method with custom parameters and observe how the object state changes. When changing the source code of the related class, the visualization holds the previous object state and adapts the new behavior defined by the underlying source code. This instantly enables developers to observe functionalities objects of a certain class have and how they manipulate their state, and especially, how source code changes influence their behavior. We implemented a first prototype as a touch-enabled web application that is connected to a conventional integrated development environment. In order to gain first practical insights, we evaluated our approach in a pilot user study.",

The study was performed on a dataset of CRs spanning over two years of activities on one of Ericsson’s largest systems (+4 Million LOC). CRs at Ericsson are divided into two types: Internal and External. Internal CRs are reported within the organization after the integration and system testing phase. External CRs are submitted by customers and caused mainly by field failures. We examine the proportion and severity of internal CRs and that of external CRs. A large number of external (and severe) CRs could indicate flaws in the testing phase. Failing to react quickly to external CRs, on the other hand, may expose Ericsson to fines and penalties due to the Working Level Agreements (WLA) that Ericsson has with its customers. Moreover, we contrast the time it takes to handle each type of CRs with the dual aim to understand the similarities and differences as well as the factors that impact the handling of each type of CRs. Our results show that (a) it takes more time to fix external CRs compared to internal CRs, (b) the severity attribute is used inconsistently through organizational units, (c) assignment time of internal CRs is less than that of external CRs, (d) More than 50% of CRs are not answered within the organization’s fixing time requirements defined in WLA.",

Despite the efforts of researchers and mobile API designers to provide developers with guidelines and best practices for improving the performance of mobile apps, performance bottlenecks are still a significant and frequent complaint that impacts the ratings and apps’ chances for success. However, little research has been done into understanding actual developers’ practices for detecting and fixing performance bottlenecks in mobile apps. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study aimed at studying and understanding these practices by surveying 485 open source Android app and library developers, and manually analyzing performance bugs and fixes in their app repositories hosted on GitHub. The paper categorizes actual practices and tools used by real developers while dealing with performance issues. In general, our findings indicate that developers heavily rely on user reviews and manual execution of the apps for detecting performance bugs. While developers also use available tools to detect performance bottlenecks, these tools are mostly for profiling and do not help in detecting and fixing performance issues automatically",

Presenting four industrial case studies from renowned and world market leading German machine and plant manufac-turing companies, these challenges and different solution ap-proaches are introduced with a focus on software architectures to support modularity as a basis for maintaining long-living automated Production Systems. Additionally, most critical as-pects hindering classical approaches from software engineering to be successful, e.g., modes of operation and fault handling, are discussed. In the last decades, research in the field of software engineering for automated Production Systems (aPS) has been focusing on developing domain specific model-driven engineering approaches supporting the development process, but mostly neglecting the operation, maintenance and re-engineering as-pects. However, the success of model-driven engineering in aPS industry has been limited because the effort to introduce model-driven engineering and to change the entire existing legacy soft-ware is estimated as too high and the benefit as too low against the background of customer specific solutions expecting a low degree of reuse.",

The smell detection algorithm used in this earlier study was validated on a small dataset of industrial spreadsheets by interviewing the users of these spreadsheets and asking them about their opinion about the found smells. In this paper a more in depth validation of the algorithm is done by analyzing a set of spreadsheets of which users indicated whether or not they are smelly. This new dataset gives us the unique possibility to get more insight in how we can distinguish `bad&#039; spreadsheets from `good&#039; spreadsheets. We do that in two ways: For both the smelly and non smelly spreadsheets we 1) have calculated the metrics that detect the smells and 2) have calculated metrics with respect to size, level of coupling, and the use of functions. The results show that indeed the metrics for the smells decrease in spreadsheets that are not smelly. With respect to size we found to our surprise that the improved spreadsheets were not smaller, but bigger. With regard to coupling and the use of functions both datasets are similar. It indicates that it is difficult to use metrics with respect to size, degree of coupling or use of functions to draw conclusions on the complexity of a spreadsheet.",

            "Abstract": "Developers often rely on the web-based tools for troubleshooting, collaboration, issue tracking, code reviewing, documentation viewing, and a myriad of other uses. Developers also use the web for non-development purposes, such as reading news or social media. In this paper we explore whether web usage is detriment to a developer&#039;s focus on work from a sample over 150 developers. Additionally, we investigate if highly-focused developers use the web differently than other developers. Our qualitative findings suggest highly-focused developers use the web differently, but we are unable to predict a developer&#039;s focused based on web usage alone. Further quantitative findings suggest that web usage does not have a negative impact on a developer&#039;s focus.",

            "Abstract": "During software projects, several parts of the source code are usually re-written due to imperfect solutions before the code is released. This wasted effort is of central interest to the project management to assure on-time delivery. Although the amount of thrown-away code can be measured from version control systems, stakeholders are more interested in productivity dynamics that reflect the constant change in a software project. In this paper we present a field study of measuring the productivity of a medium-sized J2EE project. We propose a productivity analysis method where productivity is expressed through dynamic profiles -- the so-called Micro-Productivity Profiles (MPPs). They can be used to characterize various constituents of software projects such as components, phases and teams. We collected detailed traces of developers&#039; actions using an Eclipse IDE plug-in for seven months of software development throughout two milestones. We present and evaluate profiles of two important axes of the development process: by milestone and by application layers. MPPs can be an aid to take project control actions and help in planning future projects. Based on the experiments, project stakeholders identified several points to improve the development process. It is also acknowledged, that profiles show additional information compared to a naive diff-based approach.",

            "Abstract": "Comments and identifiers are the main source of documentation of source-code and are therefore an integral part of the development and the maintenance of a program. As English is the world language, most comments and identifiers are written in English. However, if they are in any other language, a developer without knowledge of this language will almost perceive the code to be undocumented or even obfuscated. In absence of industrial data, academia is not aware of the extent of the problem of non- English comments and identifiers in practice. In this paper, we propose an approach for the language identification of source- code comments and identifiers. With the approach, a large-scale study has been conducted of the natural language of source-code comments and identifiers, analyzing multiple open-source and industry systems. The results show that a significant amount of the industry projects contain comments and identifiers in more than one language, whereas none of the analyzed open-source systems has this problem.",

            "Abstract": "Software applications integrate more and more open-source software (OSS) to benefit from code reuse. As a drawback, each vulnerability discovered in bundled OSS may potentially affect the application that includes it. Upon the disclosure of every new vulnerability, the application vendor has to assess whether such vulnerability is exploitable in the particular usage context of the applications, and needs to determine whether customers require an urgent patch containing a non-vulnerable version of the OSS. Unfortunately, current decision making relies mostly on natural-language vulnerability descriptions and expert knowledge, and is therefore difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone. This paper proposes a novel approach to support the impact assessment based on the analysis of code changes introduced by security fixes. We describe our approach using an illustrative example and perform a comparison with both proprietary and open-source state-of-the-art solutions. Finally we report on our experience with a sample application and two industrial development projects.",

            "Abstract": "Software quality assessments are critical in organizations where the software has been produced by external vendors, or when the development and maintenance of a software product has been outsourced to external parties. These assessments are typically challenging because is not always possible to access the original developers (or sometimes is not even allowed), and in rare cases suppliers keep an account of the costs associated to code changes or defect fixes. In those situations, one is left with the artifacts (e.g., database, source code, and documentation) as the only sources of evidence for performing such evaluations. A major challenge is also to provide fact-based conclusions for supporting decision-making, instead of subjective interpretations based on expert assessments (an approach still very predominant in mainstream industrial practice). This paper describes an instance of a software quality evaluation process performed for an international logistics company, which combined: benchmark-based metrics threshold analysis, software visualization, and expert assessment. An interview was carried out afterwards with a member from the business division of the company, to assess the usefulness of the methodology and corresponding findings, and to explore avenues for future improvement.",

            "Abstract": "Refactoring is often treated as the main remedy against the unavoidable code erosion happening during software evolution. Studies show that refactoring is indeed an elemental part of the developers&#039; arsenal. However, empirical studies about the impact of refactorings on software maintainability still did not reach a consensus. Moreover, most of these empirical investigations are carried out on open-source projects where distinguishing refactoring operations from other development activities is a challenge in itself. We had a chance to work together with several software development companies in a project where they got extra budget to improve their source code by performing refactoring operations. Taking advantage of this controlled environment, we collected a large amount of data during a refactoring phase where the developers used a (semi)automatic refactoring tool. By measuring the maintainability of the involved subject systems before and after the refactorings, we got valuable insights into the effect of these refactorings on large-scale industrial projects. All but one company, who applied a special refactoring strategy, achieved a maintainability improvement at the end of the refactoring phase, but even that one company suffered from the negative impact of only one type of refactoring.",

We conducted an empirical evalua-tion of 456 defects detected from the requirement specification inspections conducted during the development of industrial soft-ware. The defects were collected from an earlier version, which included 59 high-severity defects, and from a later version, which included 48 high-severity defects. The results of the evaluation showed that nine defect types and their corresponding inspection scenarios were obtained by abstracting and summarizing 45 de-fects in the earlier version. The results of the evaluation also showed that 46 of the high-severity defects in the later version could be potentially detected using the obtained inspection sce-narios. The study also investigated which inspection scenarios can be obtained by the checklist proposed in the value-based review (VBR). It was difficult to obtain five of the inspection sce-narios using the VBR checklist. Furthermore, to investigate the effectiveness of cluster analysis for inspection scenario develop-ment, the 59 high-severity defects in the earlier version were clus-tered into similar defect groups by a clustering algorithm. The results indicated that cluster analysis can be a guide for selecting similar defects and help in the tasks of abstracting and summa-rizing defects.",

The current automated regression test suite takes approximately seven hours to run which prevents developers from integrating code changes several times a day as preferred. Therefore we want to implement a highly selective yet accurate regression testing strategy. Traditional code coverage based techniques are not applicable due to the size and complexity of the software under test. Instead we decided to select tests based on regression test history. We developed a tool, the Difference Engine, which parses and analyzes results from previous test runs and outputs regression test recommendations. The Difference Engine correlates code and test cases at package level and recommends test cases that are strongly correlated to recently changed packages. We evaluated the technique with respect to correctness, precision, recall and efficiency. Our results are promising. On average the tool manages to identify 80% of the relevant tests while recommending only 4% of the test cases in the full regression test suite.",

            "Abstract": "Searching code samples in a code repository is an important part of program comprehension. Most of the existing tools for code search support syntactic element search and regular expression pattern search. However, they are text-based and hence cannot handle queries which are syntactic patterns. The proposed solutions for querying syntactic patterns using specialized query languages present a steep learning curve for users. The querying would be more user-friendly if the syntactic pattern can be formulated in the underlying programming language (as a sample code snippet) instead of a specialized query language. In this paper, we propose a solution for the query by example problem using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structural similarity match. The query snippet is converted to an AST, then its subtrees are compared against AST subtrees of source files in the repository and the similarity values of matching subtrees are aggregated to arrive at a relevance score for each of the source files. To scale this approach to large code repositories, we use locality-sensitive hash functions and numerical vector approximation of trees. Our experimental evaluation involves running control queries against a real project. The results show that our algorithm can achieve high precision (0.73) and recall (0.81) and scale to large code repositories without compromising quality.",

            "Abstract": "Software modernization has been extensively researched, primarily focusing on observing the associated phenomena, and providing technical solutions to facilitate the modernization process. Software modernization is claimed to be successful when the modernization is completed using those technical solutions. Very limited research, if any, is reported with an aim at documenting the post-modernization impacts, i.e., whether any of the pre-modernization business goals are in fact achieved after modernization. In this research, we attempt to address this relative absence of empirical study through five retrospective software modernization case studies. We use an explanatory case study approach to document the pre-modernization business goals, and to decide whether those goals have been achieved. The intended benefits for each of the five cases we considered were all (partially) met, and in most cases fully. Moreover, many cases exhibited a number of unintended benefits, and some reported detrimental effects of modernization.",

The starting point was the code fragments generated by the VisualAge interactive development tool. The results of the reverse engineering process were a use case documentation, a module documentation and a system reference repository. In these documents, the names of the data and functions were extended to be more understandable. The process was in the end fully automated and took three months to implement. The resulting documentation is now being used as a basis for re-implementing the system in Java.",

Depending on the range and variability of a manufacturer&#039;s product portfolio a huge library of GUI software may exist. This poses quite a challenge when it comes to testing or re-engineering. Static analysis helps to unveil valuable, inherent knowledge and prepare it for further analysis and processing. In our case at ENGEL Austria GmbH, we extract the internal structure of the GUI screens, their variants and the control system context they are used in, i.e. which PLC variables they access. In another step, we analyze the usage pattern of method calls to certain UI widgets. In this paper we show our approach to gain these information based on static analysis of existing GUI source code for injection molding machines.",

Without such knowledge, researchers and tool builders are in danger of making wrong assumptions and building inadequate tools. In this paper we present an in-depth empirical study about the motivations developers have for examining software history, the strategies they use, and the challenges they encounter. To learn these, we interviewed 14 experienced developers from industry, and then extended our findings by surveying 217 developers. We found that history does not begin with the latest commit but with uncommitted changes. Moreover, we found that developers had different motivations for examining recent and old history. Based on these findings we propose 3-LENS HISTORY, a novel unified model for reasoning about software history.",

            "Abstract": "Developers performing maintenance activities must balance their efforts to learn the code vs. their efforts to actually change it. This balancing act is consistent with the &quot;production bias&quot; that, according to Carroll&#039;s minimalist learning theory, generally affects software users during everyday tasks. This suggests that developers&#039; focus on efficiency should have marked effects on how they forage for the information they think they need to fix bugs. To investigate how developers balance fixing versus learning during debugging, we conducted the first empirical investigation of the interplay between production bias and information foraging. Our theory-based study involved 11 participants: half tasked with fixing a bug, and half tasked with learning enough to help someone else fix it. Despite the subtlety of difference between their tasks, participants foraged remarkably differently-- making foraging decisions from different types of &quot;patches,&quot; with different types of information, and succeeding with different foraging tactics.",

They are proposed as an alternative modular view, which can be used to assess the traditional decomposition of systems in packages. To investigate developer&#039;s perception of co-change clusters, we report in this paper a study with experts on six systems, implemented in two languages. We mine 102 co-change clusters from the version history of such systems, which are classified in three patterns regarding their projection to the package structure: Encapsulated, Crosscutting, and Octopus. We then collect the perception of expert developers on such clusters, aiming to ask two central questions: (a) what concerns and changes are captured by the extracted clusters? (b) do the extracted clusters reveal design anomalies? We conclude that Encapsulated Clusters are often viewed as healthy designs and that Crosscutting Clusters tend to be associated to design anomalies. Octopus Clusters are normally associated to expected class distributions, which are not easy to implement in an encapsulated way, according to the interviewed developers.",

While previous studies either investigated licensing through mining software repositories or studied licensing through FOSS reuse, we aim at understanding the rationale behind developers&#039; decisions for choosing or changing software at understanding the rationale behind developers&#039; decisions for choosing or changing software licensing by surveying open source developers. In this paper, we analyze when developers consider licensing, the reasons why developers pick a license for their project, and the factors that influence licensing changes. Additionally, we explore the licensing-related problems that developers experienced and expectations they have for licensing support from forges (e.g., GitHub). Our investigation involves, on one hand, the analysis of the commit history of 16,221 Java open source projects to identify the commits where licenses were added or changed. On the other hand, it consisted of a survey---in which 138 developers informed their involvement in licensing-related decisions and 52 provided deeper insights about the rationale behind the actions that they had undertaken. The results indicate that developers adopt licenses early in the project&#039;s development and change licensing after some period of development (if at all). We also found that developers have inherent biases with respect to software licensing. Additionally, reuse---whether by a non-contributor or for commercial purposes---is a dominant reason why developers change licenses of their systems. Finally, we discuss potential areas of research that could ameliorate the difficulties that software developers are facing with regard to licensing issues of their software systems.",

Conventions also provide cues that help developers and tools extract information from identifier names to support software maintenance. Tools exist to automatically check naming conventions but they are often limited to simple checks, e.g. regarding typography. The adherence to more elaborate conventions, such as the use of noun and verbal phrases in names, is not checked. We present Nominal, a naming convention checking library for Java that allows the declarative specification of conventions regarding typography and the use of abbreviations and phrases. To test Nominal, and to investigate the extent to which developers follow conventions, we extract 3.5 million reference - field, formal argument and local variable - name declarations from 60 FLOSS projects and determine their adherence to two well-known Java naming convention guidelines that give developers scope to choose a variety of forms of name, and sometimes offer conflicting advice. We found developers largely follow naming conventions, but adherence to specific conventions varies widely.",

Specifically, many algorithmic steps (e.g., count, compare pairs of elements, find the maximum) are implemented as loop structures, which lack the higher level abstraction of the action being performed, and can negatively affect both human readers and automatic tools. Additionally, in a study of 14,317 projects, we found that less than 20% of loops are documented to help readers. In this paper, we present a novel automatic approach to identify the high level action implemented by a given loop. We leverage the available, large source of high-quality open source projects to mine loop characteristics and develop an action identification model. We use the model and feature vectors extracted from loop code to automatically identify the high level actions implemented by loops. We have evaluated the accuracy of the loop action identification and coverage of the model over 7159 open source programs. The results show great promise for this approach to automatically insert internal comments and provide additional higher level naming for loop actions to be used by tools such as code search.",

            "Abstract": "In an execution of a large scale program, even a simple observable behavior may be generated by a wide range of the source code. To comprehend how such a behavior is implemented in the code, a debugger would be helpful. However, when using a debugger, developers often encounter several types of cumbersome tasks and are often confused by the huge and complicated runtime information. To support such a debugger-based comprehension task, we propose an abstraction technique of runtime information, named delta, and present a delta extraction and visualization tool. Basically, a delta is defined for two linked objects in an object-oriented program&#039;s execution. It intuitively represents the reason why these objects could be related in the execution, and it can hide the details of how these objects were related. We have conducted experiments on four subject tasks from two real-world systems to evaluate how appropriately an extracted delta can answer the `why&#039; question and how long the tool can reduce the working time to answer the question. The results show that each delta can successfully answer the question and a tens-of-minutes to one-hour debugger-based task can be reduced by extracting a delta.",

            "Abstract": "Feature location is a program comprehension activity in which a developer inspects source code to locate the classes or methods that implement a feature of interest. Many feature location techniques (FLTs) are based on text retrieval models, and in such FLTs it is typical for the models to be trained on source code snapshots. However, source code evolution leads to model obsolescence and thus to the need to retrain the model from the latest snapshot. In this paper, we introduce a topic-modeling-based FLT in which the model is built incrementally from source code history. By training an online learning algorithm using changesets, the FLT maintains an up-to-date model without incurring the non-trivial computational cost associated with retraining traditional FLTs. Overall, we studied over 600 defects and features from 4 open-source Java projects. We also present a historical simulation that demonstrates how the FLT performs as a project evolves. Our results indicate that the accuracy of a changeset-based FLT is similar to that of a snapshot-based FLT, but without the retraining costs.",

            "Abstract": "Code review is advocated as one of the best practices to improve software quality and reduce the likelihood of introducing defects during code change activities. Recent research has shown how code components having a high review coverage (i.e., a high proportion of reviewed changes) tend to be less involved in post-release fixing activities. Yet the relationship between code review and bug introduction or the overall software quality is still largely unexplored.  This paper presents an empirical, exploratory study on three large open source systems that aims at investigating the influence of code review on (i) the chances of inducing bug fixes and (ii) the quality of the committed code components, as assessed by code coupling, complexity, and readability.  Findings show that unreviewed commits (i.e., commits that did not undergo a review process) have over two times more chances of introducing bugs than reviewed commits (i.e., commits that underwent a review process). In addition, code committed after review has a substantially higher readability with respect to unreviewed code.",

            "Abstract": "Code clones are defined to be the exactly or nearly similar code fragments in a software system&#039;s code-base. The existing clone related studies reveal that code clones are likely to introduce bugs and inconsistencies in the code-base. However, although there are different types of clones, it is still unknown which types of clones have a higher likeliness of introducing bugs to the software systems and so, should be considered more important for managing with techniques such as refactoring or tracking. With this focus, we performed a study that compared the bug-proneness of the major clone-types: Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3. According to our experimental results on thousands of revisions of seven diverse subject systems, Type 3 clones exhibit the highest bug-proneness among the three clone-types. The bug-proneness of Type 1 clones is the lowest. Also, Type 3 clones have the highest likeliness of being co-changed consistently while experiencing bug-fixing changes. Moreover, the Type 3 clones that experience bug-fixes have a higher possibility of evolving following a Similarity Preserving Change Pattern (SPCP) compared to the bug-fix clones of the other two clone-types. From the experimental results it is clear that Type 3 clones should be given a higher priority than the other two clone-types when making clone management decisions. We believe that our study provides useful implications for ranking clones for refactoring and tracking.",

Buggy test cases can silently miss bugs in the production code or loudly ring false alarms when the production code is correct. We present the first empirical study of bugs in test code to characterize their prevalence and root cause categories. We mine the bug repositories and version control systems of 211 Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects and find 5,556 test-related bug reports. We (1) compare properties of test bugs with production bugs, such as active time and fixing effort needed, and (2) qualitatively study 443 randomly sampled test bug reports in detail and categorize them based on their impact and root causes. Our results show that (1) around half of all the projects had bugs in their test code; (2) the majority of test bugs are false alarms, i.e., test fails while the production code is correct, while a minority of these bugs result in silent horrors, i.e., test passes while the production code is incorrect; (3) incorrect and missing assertions are the dominant root cause of silent horror bugs; (4) semantic (25%), flaky (21%), environment-related (18%) bugs are the dominant root cause categories of false alarms; (5) the majority of false alarm bugs happen in the exercise portion of the tests, and (6) developers contribute more actively to fixing test bugs and test bugs are fixed sooner compared to production bugs. In addition, we evaluate whether existing bug detection tools can detect bugs in test code.",

In principle, code review should improve the quality of code changes (patches) before they are committed to the project&#039;s master repository. In practice, bugs are sometimes unwittingly introduced during this process. In this paper, we report on an empirical study investigating code review quality for Mozilla, a large open-source project. We explore the relationships between the reviewers&#039; code inspections and a set of factors, both personal and social in nature, that might affect the quality of such inspections. We applied the SZZ algorithm to detect bug-inducing changes that were then linked to the code review information extracted from the issue tracking system. We found that 54% of the reviewed changes introduced bugs in the code. Our findings also showed that both personal metrics, such as reviewer workload and experience, and participation metrics, such as the number of involved developers, are associated with the quality of the code review process.",

            "Abstract": "The presence of anti-patterns and code smells can affect adversely software evolution and quality. Recent work has shown that code smells that appear together in the same file (i.e., collocated smells) can interact with each other, leading to various types of maintenance issues and/or to the intensification of negative effects. Moreover, it has been found that code smell interactions can occur across coupled files (i.e., coupled smells), with comparable negative effects as the interaction of same- file (collocated) smells. Different inter-smell relations have been described in previous work, yet only few studies have evaluated them empirically. This study attempts to replicate the findings from previous work on inter-smell relations by analyzing larger systems, and by including both industrial and open source ones. We also include the analysis of coupled smells in addition to collocated smells, to achieve a more complete picture on the landscape of inter-smell relations. Our observations suggest that if coupled smells are not considered, one may risk increasing the number of false negatives when analysing inter-smell relations. A major finding is that patterns of inter-smell relations vary between open source and industrial systems. This suggests that contextual variables (e.g., domain, development mode, environment) should be considered in further studies on code smells.",

In this paper, we use our big data clone benchmark, BigCloneBench, to evaluate the recall of ten clone detection tools. BigCloneBench is a collection of eight million validated clones within IJaDataset-2.0, a big data software repository containing 25,000 open-source Java systems. BigCloneBench contains both intra-project and inter-project clones of the four primary clone types. We use this benchmark to evaluate the recall of the tools per clone type and across the entire range of clone syntactical similarity. We evaluate the tools for both single-system and cross-project detection scenarios. Using multiple clone-matching metrics, we evaluate the quality of the tools&#039; reporting of the benchmark clones with respect to refactoring and automatic clone analysis use-cases. We compare these real-world results against our Mutation and Injection Framework, a synthetic benchmark, to reveal deeper understanding of the tools. We found that the tools have strong recall for Type-1 and Type-2 clones, as well as Type-3 clones with high syntactical similarity. The tools have weaker detection of clones with lower syntactical similarity.",

            "Abstract": "Dependence clusters are (maximal) collections of mutually dependent source code entities according to some dependence relation. Their presence in software complicates many maintenance activities including testing, refactoring, and feature extraction. Despite several studies finding them common in production code, their formation, identification, and overall structure are not well understood, partly because of challenges in approximating true dependences between program entities. Previous research has considered two approximate dependence relations: a fine-grained statement-level relation using control and data dependences from a program’s System Dependence Graph and a coarser relation based on function-level control-flow reachability. In principal, the first is more expensive and more precise than the second. Using a collection of twenty programs, we present an empirical investigation of the clusters identified by these two approaches. In support of the analysis, we consider hybrid cluster types that works at the coarser function-level but is based on the higher-precision statement-level dependences. The three types of clusters are compared based on their slice sets using two clustering metrics. We also perform extensive analysis of the programs to identify linchpin functions – functions primarily responsible for holding a cluster together. Results include evidence that the less expensive, coarser approaches can often be used as effective proxies for the more expensive, finer-grained approaches. Finally, the linchpin analysis shows that linchpin functions can be effectively and automatically identified.",

            "Abstract": "Code cloning has been reported both on small (code fragments) and large (entire projects) scale. Cloning-in-the-large, or forking, is gaining ground as a reuse mechanism thanks to availability of better tools for maintaining forked project variants, hereunder distributed version control systems and interactive source management platforms such as Github. We study advantages and disadvantages of forking using the case of Marlin, an open source firmware for 3D printers. We find that many problems and advantages of cloning do translate to forking. Interestingly, the Marlin community uses both forking and integrated variability management (conditional compilation) to create variants and features. Thus, studying it increases our understanding of the choice between integrated and clone-based variant management. It also allows us to observe mechanisms governing source code maturation, in particular when, why and how feature implementations are migrated from forks to the main integrated platform. We believe that this understanding will ultimately help development of tools mixing clone-based and integrated variant management, combining the advantages of both.",

            "Abstract": "The detection of behavioral design patterns is more accurate when a dynamic analysis is performed on the candidate instances identified statically. Such a dynamic analysis requires the monitoring of the candidate instances at run-time through the execution of a set of test cases. However, the definition of such test cases is a time-consuming task if performed manually, even more, when the number of candidate instances is high and they include many false positives. In this paper we present the results of an empirical study aiming at assessing the effectiveness of dynamic analysis based on automatically generated test cases in behavioral design pattern detection. The study considered three behavioral design patterns, namely State, Strategy, and Observer, and three publicly available software systems, namely JHotDraw 5.1, QuickUML 2001, and MapperXML 1.9.7. The results show that dynamic analysis based on automatically generated test cases improves the precision of design pattern detection tools based on static analysis only. As expected, this improvement in precision is achieved at the expenses of recall, so we also compared the results achieved with automatically generated test cases with the more expensive but also more accurate results achieved with manually built test cases. The results of this analysis allowed us to highlight costs and benefits of automating dynamic analysis for design pattern detection.",

Identifying their root causes can be costly in terms of time and human resources. We present an approach to automatically pinpoint such defects without error reproduction. It uses static analysis to infer the correlation degree between each configuration option and program sites affected by an exception. The only run-time information required by our approach is the stack trace of a failure. This is an essential advantage compared to existing approaches which require to reproduce errors or to provide testing oracles. We evaluate our approach on 29 errors from 4 configurable software programs, namely JChord, Randoop, Hadoop, and Hbase. Our approach can successfully diagnose 27 out of 29 errors. For 20 errors, the failure-inducing configuration option is ranked first.",

            "Abstract": "Dynamic race detectors operate by analyzing ex- ecution traces of programs to detect races in multithreaded programs. As the thread interleavings influence these traces, the sets of races detected across multiple runs of the detector can vary. This non-determinism without any change in program source and input can reduce programmer confidence in using the detector. From an organizational perspective, a defect needs to be reported consistently until it is fixed. Non-determinism complicates the work flow and the problem is further exacerbated with modifications to the program. In this paper, we propose a framework for deterministic dynamic race detection that ensures detection of races until they are fixed, even across program versions. The design attempts to preserve the racy behavior with changes to the program source that include addition (and deletion) of locks and shared memory accesses. We record, transform and replay the schedules across program versions intelligently to achieve this goal. We have implemented a framework, named STABLER, and evaluated our ideas by applying popular race detectors (DJIT+, FastTrack) on different versions of many open-source multi- threaded Java programs. Our experimental results show that we are able to detect all the unfixed races consistently across major releases of the program. For both the detectors, the maximum incurred slowdown, with our framework, for record and replay is 1.2x and 2.29x respectively. We also perform user experiments where volunteers fixed a significant number of races. In spite of these changes, our framework is effective in its ability to detect all the unfixed races.",

Precise static analysis of these programs in the context of software transformation and verification tasks is a challenging problem. Our key insight is that static analysis of file-processing programs can be made more useful if knowledge of the input file formats of these programs is made available to the analysis. We instantiate this idea to solve two practical problems -- specializing the code of a program to a given ``restricted&#039;&#039; input file format, and verifying if a program ``conforms&#039;&#039; to a given input file format. We then discuss an implementation of our approach, and also empirical results on a set of real and realistic programs. The results are very encouraging in the terms of both scalability as well as precision of the approach.",

            "Abstract": "As a software project evolves, so does its build system. Significant effort is necessary to maintain the build system to cope with this evolution, in part because changes to source code often require parallel changes in the build system. Our tool, Formiga, is a build maintenance and dependency discovery tool for the Ant build system. Formiga&#039;s primary uses are to automate build changes as the source code is updated, to identify the build dependencies within a software project, and to assist with build refactoring. Formiga is implemented as an IDE plugin, which allows it to recognize when project resources are updated and automatically update the build system accordingly. A controlled experiment was conducted to assess Formiga&#039;s ability to assist developers with build maintenance. Subjects responded to scenarios in which various forms of build maintenance and/or knowledge about deliverables and their contents were requested. Subjects completed eleven different build maintenance tasks in both an experimental condition using Formiga and a control condition using only conventional IDE services. The study used a balanced design relative to both task order and use of Formiga. This design also ensured that order balancing was not confounded with the subjects&#039; level of Ant expertise. Formiga was shown to significantly reduce the time required to perform build maintenance while increasing the correctness with which it can be performed for both novice and experienced developers.",

A programmer must distinguish refactorings that are provided by an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from those that must be realized manually, determine a precise sequence of refactorings to apply, and perform this sequence repetitively to a laborious degree. We designed, implemented, and evaluated Reflective Refactoring (R2), a Java package to automate the creation of classical design patterns (Visitor, Abstract Factory, etc.), their inverses, and variants. We encoded 18 out of 23 Gang-of-Four design patterns as R2 scripts and explain why the remaining are inappropriate for refactoring engines. We evaluate the productivity and scalability of R2 with a case study of 6 real-world applications. In one case, R2 automatically created a Visitor with 276 visit methods by invoking 554 Eclipse refactorings in 10 minutes - an achievement that could not be done manually. R2 also sheds light on why refactoring correctness, expressiveness, and speed are critical issues for scripting in next-generation refactoring engines.",

            "Abstract": "During its lifetime, a software system might undergo a major transformation effort in its structure, for example to mi- grate to a new architecture or bring some drastic improvements to the system. Particularly in this context, we found evidences that some sequences of code changes are made in a systematic way. These sequences are composed of small code transformations (e.g., create a class, move a method) which are repeatedly applied to groups of related entities (e.g., a class and some of its methods). A typical example consists in the systematic introduction of a Factory design pattern on the classes of a package. We define these sequences as transformation patterns. In this paper, we identify examples of transformation patterns in real world software systems and study their properties: (i) they are specific to a system; (ii) they were applied manually; (iii) they were not always applied to all the software entities which could have been transformed; (iv) they were sometimes complex; and (v) they were not always applied in one shot but over several releases. These results suggest that transformation patterns could benefit from automated support in their application. From this study, we propose as future work to develop a macro recorder, a tool with which a developer records a sequence of code transformations and then automatically applies them in other parts of the system as a customizable, large-scale transformation operator.",

Dependency cycles are claimed to affect quality factors such as testability, extensibility, modifiability, and reusability. Recent studies reveal that most defects are concentrated in classes that are in and near cycles. In this paper, we (1) propose a new metric: IRCRSS based on the Class Reachability Set Size (CRSS) to identify the reduction ratio between the CRSS of a class and its interfaces, and (2) presents a cycle-breaking decision support system (CB-DSS) that implements existing design approaches in combination with class edge contextual data. Evaluations of multiple systems show that (1) the IRCRSS metric can be used to identify fewer classes as candidates for breaking large cycles, thus reducing refactoring effort, and (2) the CB-DSS can assist software engineers to plan restructuring of classes involved in complex dependency cycles.",

            "Abstract": "The importance of human-related factors in the introduction of bugs has recently been the subject of a number of empirical studies. However, such factors have not been captured yet in bug prediction models which simply exploit product metrics or process metrics based on the number and type of changes or on the number of developers working on a software component. Previous studies have demonstrated that focused developers are less prone to introduce defects than non focused developers. According to this observation, software components changed by focused developers should also be less error prone than software components changed by less focused developers. In this paper we capture this observation by measuring the structural and semantic scattering of changes performed by the developers working on a software component and use these two measures to build a bug prediction model. Such a model has been evaluated on five open source systems and compared with two competitive prediction models: the first exploits the number of developers working on a code component in a given time period as predictor, while the second is based on the concept of code change entropy. The achieved results show the superiority of our model with respect to the two competitive approaches, and the complementarity of the defined scattering measures with respect to standard predictors commonly used in the literature.",

            "Abstract": "Software engineering research now considers that no system is an island, but it is part of an ecosystem involving other systems, developers, users, hardware, . . . When one system (e.g., a framework) evolves, its clients often need to adapt. Client developers might need to adapt to functionalities, client systems might need to be adapted to a new API, client users might need to adapt to a new User Interface. The consequences of such changes are yet unclear, what proportion of the ecosystem might be expected to react, how long might it take for a change to diffuse in the ecosystem, do all clients react in the same way? This paper reports on an exploratory study aimed at observing API evolution and its impact on a large-scale software ecosystem, Pharo, which has about 3,600 distinct systems, more than 2,800 contributors, and six years of evolution. We analyze 118 API changes and answer research questions regarding the magnitude, duration, extension, and consistency of such changes in the ecosystem. The results of this study help to characterize the impact of API evolution in large software ecosystems, and provide the basis to better understand how such impact can be alleviated.",

            "Abstract": "Software code review is a process of developers inspecting new code changes made by others, to evaluate their quality and identify and fix defects, before integrating them to the main branch of a version control system. Modern Code Review (MCR), a lightweight and tool-based variant of conventional code review, is widely adopted in both open source and proprietary software projects. One challenge that impacts MCR is the assignment of appropriate developers to review a code change. Considering that there could be hundreds of potential code reviewers in a software project, picking suitable reviewers is not a straightforward task. A prior study by Thongtanunam et al. showed that the difficulty in selecting suitable reviewers may delay the review process by an average of 12 days. In this paper, to address the challenge of assigning suitable reviewers to changes, we propose a hybrid and incremental approach TIE which utilizes the advantages of both text mining and a file location-based approach. To do this, TIE integrates an incremental text mining model which analyzes the textual contents in a review request, and a similarity model which measures the similarity of changed file paths and reviewed file paths. We perform a large-scale experiment on four open source projects, namely Android, OpenStack, QT, and LibreOffice, containing a total of 42,045 reviews. The experimental results show that on average TIE can achieve top-1, top-5, and top-10 accuracies, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.52, 0.79, 0.85, and 0.64 for the four projects, which improves the state-of-the-art approach RevFinder, proposed by Thongtanunam et al., by 61%, 23%, 8%, and 37%, respectively.",

In this paper, we first present a study that helps us to understand how developers complete method parameters. Based on our observations, we developed a recommendation technique, called Parc, that collects parameter usage context using a source code localness property that suggests that developers tend to collocate related code fragments. Parc uses previous code examples together with contextual and static type analysis to recommend method parameters. Evaluating our technique against the only available state-of-the-art tool using a number of subject systems and different Java libraries shows that our approach has potential. We also explore the parameter recommendation support provided by the Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT). Finally, we discuss limitations of our proposed technique and outline future research directions.",

            "Abstract": "App Stores, such as Google Play or the Apple Store, allow users to provide feedback on apps by posting review comments and giving star ratings. These platforms constitute a useful electronic mean in which application developers and users can productively exchange information about apps. Previous research showed that users feedback contains usage scenarios, bug reports and feature requests, that can help app developers to accomplish software maintenance and evolution tasks. However, in the case of the most popular apps, the large amount of received feedback, its unstructured nature and varying quality can make the identification of useful user feedback a very challenging task. In this paper we present a taxonomy to classify app reviews into categories relevant to software maintenance and evolution, as well as an approach that merges three techniques: (1) Natural Language Processing, (2) Text Analysis and (3) Sentiment Analysis to automatically classify app reviews into the proposed categories. We show that the combined use of these techniques allows to achieve better results (a precision of 75% and a recall of 74%) than results obtained using each technique individually (precision of 70% and a recall of 67%).",

After installing/updating apps, users can post reviews and provide ratings, expressing their level of satisfaction with apps, and possibly pointing out bugs or desired features. In this paper we show—by performing a study on 100 Android apps—how developers addressing user reviews increase their app’s success in terms of ratings. Specifically, we devise an approach, named CRISTAL, for tracing informative crowd reviews onto source code changes, and for monitoring the extent to which developers accommodate crowd requests and follow-up user reactions as reflected in their ratings. The results indicate that developers implementing user reviews are rewarded in terms of ratings. This poses the need for specialized recommendation systems aimed at analyzing informative crowd reviews and prioritizing feedback to be satisfied in order to increase the apps success.",

However, while there is no shortage of stories of how lone developers have made great fortunes from their apps, the majority of developers are struggling to break even. For those struggling developers, knowing the ``DNA&#039;&#039; (i.e., characteristics) of high-rated apps is the first step towards successful development and evolution of their apps. In this paper, we investigate 28 factors along eight dimensions to understand how high-rated apps are different from low-rated apps. We also investigate what are the most influential factors by applying a random-forest classifier to identify high-rated apps. Through a case study on 1,492 high-rated and low-rated free apps mined from the Google Play store, we find that high-rated apps are statistically significantly different in 17 out of the 28 factors that we considered. Our experiment also shows that the size of an app, the number of promotional images that the app displays on its web store page, and the target SDK version of an app are the most influential factors.",

Any change may potentially affect an application&#039;s behaviour, performance, and energy consumption profile. Our previous work demonstrated that changes to the system-call profile of an application correlated with changes to the application&#039;s energy-consumption profile. This paper evaluates and describes GreenAdvisor, a first of its kind tool that systematically records and analyzes an application&#039;s system calls to predict whether the energy-consumption profile of an application has changed. The GreenAdvisor tool was distributed to numerous software teams, whose members were surveyed about their experience using GreenAdvisor while developing Android applications to examine the energy-consumption impact of selected commits from the teams&#039; projects. GreenAdvisor was evaluated against commits of these teams&#039; projects. The two studies confirm the usefulness of our tool in assisting developers analyze and understand the energy-consumption profile changes of a new version. Based on our study findings, we constructed an improved prediction model to forecast the direction of the change, when a change in the energy-consumption profile is anticipated. This work can potentially be extremely useful to developers who currently have no similar tools.",

However, the increasingly distributed nature of software development requires basic repository analyses to be always available to developers, even when they cannot access their workstation with full-fledged applications and command-line tools. We present UrbanIt, a gesture-based tablet application for the iPad that supports the visualization of software repositories together with useful evolutionary analyses (e.g. version diff) and basic sharing features in a portable and mobile setting. UrbanIt is paired with a web application that manages synchronization of multiple repositories.",

We present an Eclipse plugin, called PARC, that supports automatic completion of API method parameters.

PARC combines contextual and static type analysis to support a wide range of parameter expression types.",

Much progress has been made in understanding the feature location process and in creating new tools to help a developer in performing this task. However, there is still lack of support for locating architectural features, ones that require a developer to touch on more than one architectural component. We demonstrate a tool called ArchFLoc that can be used to discover and highlight architectural level features that are otherwise hidden in a software system. ArchFLoc is integrated into user interfaces, so the developer can express a feature query by directly interacting with user interface elements at runtime. Based on the user query, ArchFLoc discovers relevant code artifacts and dependencies, and assembles documentation to explain their roles in the overall architectural design.",

However, the lightweight nature of its syntax does not necessitate the use of systematic methods and tools.

We present the WSDarwin set of tools to generate WADL interfaces for REST services, to compare service interfaces to identify differences between versions, and to compare service offerings of different vendors to facilitate service discovery and interoperability.

The result is a set of web services that can be accessed in a private or public cloud. The technique used is to cut out selected portions of code and to wrap them behind a service interface. The code itself can be left in the original language. The service interface is in WSDL. The speaker describes how to go about selecting code for reuse and how to extract that code from its current environment. Case studies are given for the languages COBOL and Java. The presentation then goes on to describe how to test the services using a web service testing tool which generates artificial requests from the service interface definition and validates the responses against the assertions provided by the tester.",

Today, engineering and deploying software as a service requires specific Internet protocols, middleware and languages that often complicate the interoperability of software at all levels. Moreover, cloud computing demands stringent quality requirements, such as security, scalability, and interoperability among others, to provide services and data across networks more efficiently. As software engineers must face the problem to redesign and redeploy systems as services, we explore in this paper the challenges found during the migration of an existing system to a cloud solution and based on a set of quality requirements that includes the vendor lock-in factor. We also present a set of as-sessment activities and guidelines to support migration to the Cloud by adopting SOA and Cloud modeling standards and tools.",

However, related researches often concentrates on traditional mixed redundancy strategy in which cold standby components is working only after all active nodes fail. So a model is developed to evaluate the reliability and performance of cloud-based degraded system subjected to mixed active and cold standby redundancy strategy with continual monitoring and detection mechanism. It is assumed that the node switching pro-cess is triggered once some active nodes fail and there are availa-ble standby nodes. A continuous-time Markov chain is built on top of the state transition process and both transient and steady state availability and expected job completion rate are used to evaluate system metrics with or with repair facilities. A numerical method is used to solve the model and sensitivity analysis is con-ducted on different redundancy strategy. Illustrative examples using real-world data were presented to explain the process of calculating the probability of each state and the different kinds of availability and performance. The comparison with traditional mixed redundancy strategy proved that the system behavior was different using different kinds of mixed strategy and the analysis model for traditional strategy was not suitable for strategies in cloud-bases system.",

In parallel, cloud computing is also increasingly being adopted due to its flexibility, cost efficiency and scalability. However, evaluating and modelling NoSQL clusters present many challenges. In this work, we explore these challenges by performing a series of experiments with various configurations. The intuition is that this process is laborious and expensive and the goal of our experiments is to confirm this intuition and to identify the factors that impact the performance of a Big Data cluster. Our experiments mostly focus on three factors: data compression, data schema and cluster topology. We performed a number of experiments based on these factors and measured and compared the response times of the resulting configurations. Eventually, the outcomes of our study are encapsulated in a performance model that predicts the cluster&#039;s response time as a function of the incoming workload and evaluates the cluster&#039;s performance less costly and faster. This systematic and effortless evaluation method will facilitate the selection and migration to a better cluster as the performance and budget goals change. We use HBase as the large data processing cluster and we conduct our experiments on traffic data from a large city and on a distributed community cloud infrastructure.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, a sustainability driven approach is proposed to measure the viability of cloud migration. The decision on cloud migration is based on sustainability dimensions, i.e., economic, environmental, social and technology, and risks associated with in these dimensions. We use Analytic Hierarchy Process and fuzzy scale to prioritize the sustainability dimensions based on a migration context to calculate Total Sustainability Index (TSI). TSI is then used to determine the viability of cloud migration according to three different scales, i.e., convincing, moderate, and ineffective. Finally, we used a practical migration use case from Ministry of Health (MoH), Malaysia to demonstrate the applicability of our work. The results from the studied context concluded that economic and business continuity are the key influential concerns for a sustainable cloud migration.",

Other frameworks such as ITIL or EFQM provide recommendations for identifying, planning, deliv-ering and supporting IT services to the business through adapta-tion of the business models and processes. All this best practices are scattered through different sources and there is not a unique criteria covering all the aspects. This paper proposes a maturity assessment approach support-ed by tools based on standards widely adopted in the industry. It covers best practices in the three dimensions and ranks the pos-sible solutions in terms of the most suitable alternatives for cloud based solutions. The maturity assessment has been also comple-mented with the functionality of capturing user information, and transforming it in useful information in terms of reports and files for the migration process.",

With a view to avoid SLA violation, the main parameters should be determined in the agreement and then used to evaluate the fulfillment of the SLA terms at the client’s side. Current studies in cloud monitoring only handle monitoring the provider resources with little or no consideration to the client’s side. This paper presents MonSLAR, a user-centric middleware for Monitoring SLA for Restful services in SaaS cloud computing environments. MonSLAR uses a distributed architecture that allows SLA parameters and the monitored data to be embedded in the requests and responses of the REST protocol.",

Practitioners are forced to deal with technical integration issues, instead of focusing on their projects&#039; actual objectives. Lacking integration support, the resulting toolchains are rigid and inflexible, impeding project progress. This paper presents SENSEI, a service-oriented support framework for toolchain-building, that clearly separates software evolution needs from implementing tools and interoperability issues. It aims to improve interoperability using component-based principles, and provides model-driven code generation to partly automate the integration process. The approach has been prototypically implemented, and was applied in the context of the Q-MIG project, to build parts of an integrated software migration and quality assessment toolchain.",

Therefore they are not able to measure test coverage at the code level, as is done in conventional white-box testing. They are compelled to measure test coverage in other ways which satisfy the constraints of black-box testing. We propose some alternate means of measuring test coverage by focusing on the structure and content of the service interface without regarding the code. The result is a new way of measuring test coverage which can apply to testing in a SoA environment.",

            "Abstract": "Current tools for managing technical debt are able to report the principal of the debt, i.e., the amount of effort required to fix all the quality rules violated in a project. However, they do not report the interest, i.e., the disadvantages the project had or will have due to quality rules violations. As a consequence, the user lacks support in understanding how much the principal should be reduced and why. We claim that information about the interest is, at least, as important as the information about the principal; the interest should be quantified and treated as a first-class entity like the principal. In this paper we aim to advance the state of the art of how the interest is measured and visualized. The goal of the paper is to describe MIND, an open-source tool which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first tool supporting the quantification and visualization of the interest. MIND, by analyzing historical data coming from Redmine and Git repositories, reports the interest incurring in a software project in terms of how many extra defects occurred, or will occur, due to quality rules violations. We evaluated MIND by using it to analyze a software project stored in a dataset of more than a million lines of code. Results suggest that MIND accurately measures the interest of technical debt.",

            "Abstract": "Technical Debt is a term that has been used to express non-optimal solutions during the development of software projects. These non optimal solutions are often shortcuts that allow the project to move faster in the short term, at the cost of increased maintenance in the future. To help alleviate the impact of technical debt, a number of studies focused on the detection of technical debt. More recently, our work shown that one possible source to detect technical debt is using source code comments, also referred to as self-admitted technical debt. However, what types of technical debt can be detected using source code comments remains as an open question. Therefore, in this paper we examine code comments to determine the different types of technical debt. First, we propose four simple filtering heuristics to eliminate comments that are not likely to contain technical debt. Second, we read through more than 33K comments, and we find that self-admitted technical debt can be classified into five main types - design debt, defect debt, documentation debt, requirement debt and test debt. The most common type of self-admitted technical debt is design debt, making up between 42% to 84% of the classified comments. Lastly, we make the classified dataset of more than 33K comments publicly available for the community as a way to encourage future research and the evolution of the technical debt landscape.",

They can be seen as a source of technical debt. However, tools for code smell detection often provide far too many and different results, and identify many false positive code smell instances. In fact, these tools are rooted on initial and rather informal code smell definitions. This represents a challenge to interpret their results in different ways. In this paper, we provide an Intensity Index, to be used as an estimator to determine the most critical instances, prioritizing the examination of smells and, potentially, their removal. We apply Intensity on the detection of six well known and common smells and we report their Intensity distribution from an analysis performed on 74 systems of the Qualitas Corpus, showing how Intensity could be used to prioritize code smells inspection.",

In this context, a set of indicators has been used by automated approaches to identify TD items, but some debt may not be directly identified using only metrics collected from the source code. Goal: In this work we propose CVM-TD, a model to support the identification of technical debt through code comment analysis. Method: we performed an exploratory study on two large open sources projects with the goal of characterizing the feasibility of the proposed model to support the detection of TD through code comments analysis. Results: The results indicate that (1) developers use the dimensions considered by CVM-TD when writing code comments, (2) CVM-TD provides a vocabulary that may be used to detect TD items, and (iii) the proposed model needs to be calibrated in order calibrated in order to reduce the difference between comments returned by the vocabulary and those that may indicate a TD item. Conclusion: Code comments analysis can be used to detect TD in software projects and CVM-TD may support the development team to perform this task.",

            "Abstract": "Architectural Technical Debt has recently received the attention of the scientific community, as a suitable metaphor for describing sub-optimal architectural solutions having short-term benefits but causing a long-term negative impact. We study such phenomenon in the context of Volvo Car Group, where the development of modern cars includes complex systems with mechanical components, electronics and software working together in a complicated network to perform an increasing number of functions and meet the demands of many customers. This puts high requirements on having an architecture and design that can handle these demands. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to manage Architecture Technical Debt, in order to make sure that the advantages of sub-optimal solutions do not lead to the payment of a large interest. We conducted a case study at Volvo Car Group and we discovered that architectural violations in the detailed design had an impact on the efficiency of the communication between components, which is an essential quality in cars and other embedded systems. Such interest is not studied in literature, which usually focuses on the maintainability aspects of Technical Debt. To explore how this Architectural Technical Debt and its interest could be communicated to stakeholders, we developed a visual tool. We found that not only was the Architectural Debt highly interesting for the architects and other stakeholders at VCG, but the proposed visualization was useful in increasing the awareness of the impact that Architectural Technical Debt had on efficiency.",

            "Abstract": "One major problem in using static analyzers to manage, monitor, control, and reason about technical debt is that industrial projects have a huge amount of technical debt which reflects hundreds of quality rule violations (e.g., high complex module or low comment density). Moreover the negative impact of violating quality rules (i.e., technical debt interest) may vary across rules or even across contexts. Thus, without a context-specific validation and prioritization of quality rules, developers cannot effectively manage technical debt. This paper reports on a case study aimed at exploring the interest associated with violating quality rules; i.e., we investigate if and which quality rules are important for software developers. Our empirical method consists of a survey and a quantitative analysis of the historical data of a CMMI Level 5 software company. The main result of the quantitative analysis is that classes violating several quality rules are five times more defect prone than classes not violating any rule. The main result of the survey is that some rules are perceived by developers as more important than others; however, there is no false positive (i.e., incorrect rule or null interest). These results pave the way to a better practical use of quality rules to manage technical debt and describe new research directions for building a scientific foundation to the technical debt metaphor.",

            "Abstract": "In classic economics, when borrowing an amount of money that causes a debt to the issuer, it is not usual to have interest which can become larger than the principal. In the context of technical debt however, accumulated debt in the form of interest can in some cases quickly sum up to an amount that at some point, be-comes larger than the effort required to repay the initial amount of technical debt. In this paper we propose an approach for estimating this breaking point. Anticipating how late the breaking point is expected to come can support decision making with respect to investments on improving quality. The approach is based on a search-based optimization tool that is capable of identifying the distance of an actual object-oriented design to the corresponding optimum one.",

When refactoring is overlooked in daily development, the likelihood of larger refactorings increases with time. Disadvantages of larger refactorings include that they disrupt the daily work, require additional planning effort, and often they need to be justified to stakeholders. In this paper, we investigate with interviews how professionals make refactoring decisions. As a result, we present a framework for decision making for larger refactoring operations describing the key stages in a refactoring workflow.

Its implications range from incurring small amounts of technical debt to speed up development - a positive - to stalling and making development no longer possible - a huge negative. In this paper, we present a framework that attempts to refine the understanding of technical debt by tracing more links to the financial metaphor, specifically focusing on the concepts of restructuring and refinancing technical debt. This paper looks at technical debt as a leverage product that is contingent upon the liquidity of the debtor. From this perspective, it is then possible to more effectively assess the incurment of technical debt and also to more effectively strategize the use of leverage in software development - accounting for the respective risks and benefits it provides.",

It does not use a natural language part-of-speech tagger for identifiers within the code. A set of heuristics is defined akin to natural language usage of identifiers usage in code.

The approach is built using the srcML infrastructure and adds part-of-speech information directly into the srcML markup.",

We provide a method of creating matchings of machine-code functions using alignment techniques known from bioinformatics. We map, per function, vectors of code metrics to symbols from an alphabet using machine learning techniques, and construct sequence alignments using off-the-shelf alignment tools. Our evaluation of alignments of glibc versions, musl optimizations, different RedBoot platforms and architectures, and the Linux kernel shows that the above statement holds in all cases except for differing architectures. Our method can therefore be used to match functions in executables for most variations within one product line.",

Due to the well-known limits of dynamic analysis, we may only compute an under-approximation of the true observation-based slice. However, because the observation-based slice captures all possible dependence that can be observed, even such approximations can yield insight into the limitations of static slicing. For example, a static slice, S that is strictly smaller than the corresponding observation based slice is potentially unsafe. We present the results of three sets of experiments on 12 different programs, including benchmarks and larger programs, which investigate the relationship between static and observation-based slicing. We show that, in extreme cases, observation-based slices can find the true minimal static slice, where static techniques cannot. For more typical cases, our results illustrate the potential for observation-based slicing to highlight limitations in static slicers. Finally, we report on the sensitivity of observation-based slicing to test quality.",

However, the decision to integrate source code changes into a release is complex and has to be taken by a software manager. In this work, we identify a set of three pragmatic recipes plus variations to support the decision making of integrating code contributions into a release. These recipes cover the isolation of source code changes, contribution of test code, and the linking of commits to issues. We analyze the development history of 21 open-source software projects, to evaluate whether, and to what extent, those recipes are followed in open-source projects. The results of our analysis showed that open-source projects largely follow recipes on a compliance level of &gt; 75%. Hence, we conclude that the identified recipes plus variations can be seen as wide-spread relevant best-practices for source code integration.",

            "Abstract": "Exception handling (EH) is a well-known mechanism that aims at improving software reliability in a modular way---allowing a better separation between the code that deals with exceptional conditions and the code that deals with the normal control flow of a program. Although the exception handling mechanism was conceived almost 40 years ago, formulating a reasonable design of exception handling code is still considered a challenge, which might hinder its widespread use. This paper reports the results of an empirical study that use a mixed-method approach to investigate the adoption of the exception handing mechanism in C++. Firstly, we carried out a static analysis investigation to understand how developers employ the exception handling construct of C++, considering 65 open-source systems (which comprise 34 million lines of C++ code overall). Then, to better understand the findings from the static analysis phase, we conducted a survey involving 145 C++ developers who have contributed to the subject systems. Some of the findings consistently detected during this mixed-method study reveal that, for several projects, the use of exception handling constructs is scarce and developers favor the use of other strategies to deal with exceptional conditions. In addition, the survey respondents consider that incompatibility with existing C code and libraries, extra performance costs (in terms of response time and size of the compiled code), and lack of expertise to design an exception handling strategy are among the reasons for avoiding the use of exception handling constructs.",

However, incorrect configurations can lead to configuration errors that are hard to resolve or understand, especially in the case of multi-layer architectures, where configuration options in each layer might contradict each other or be hard to trace to each other. Hence, this paper performs an empirical study on the occurrence of multi-layer configuration options across Wordpress (WP) plugins, WP, and the PHP engine. Our analyses show that WP and its plugins use on average 76 configuration options, a number that increases across time. We also find that each plugin uses on average 1.49% to 9.49% of all WP database options, and 1.38% to 15.18% of all WP configurable constants. 85.16% of all WP database options, 78.88% of all WP configurable constants, and 52 PHP configuration options are used by at least two plugins at the same time. Finally, we show how the latter options have a larger potential for questions and confusion amongst users.",

            "Abstract": "With the open source code movement, code search with the intent of reuse has become increasingly popular. So much so that researchers have been calling it the new facet of software reuse. Although code search differs from general-purpose document search in essential ways, most tools still rely mainly on keywords matched against source code text. Recently, researchers have proposed more sophisticated ways to perform code search, such as including interface definitions in the queries (e.g., return and parameter types of the desired function, along with keywords; called here Interface-Driven Code Search - IDCS). However, to the best of our knowledge, there are few empirical studies that compare traditional keyword-based code search (KBCS) with more advanced approaches such as IDCS. In this paper we describe an experiment that compares the effectiveness of KBCS with IDCS in the task of large-scale code search of auxiliary functions implemented in Java. We also measure the impact of query expansion based on types and WordNet on both approaches. Our experiment involved 36 subjects that produced real-world queries for 16 different auxiliary functions and a repository with more than 2,000,000 Java methods. Results show that the use of types can improve recall and the number of relevant functions returned (#RFR) when combined with query expansion (~30% improvement in recall, and ~43% improvement in #RFR). However, a more detailed analysis suggests that in some situations it is best to use keywords only, in particular when these are sufficient to semantically define the desired function.",

Many textual feature location techniques utilize information retrieval and rely on comments and identifiers of source code to describe software entities. An interesting alternative would be to employ the changeset descriptions of the code altered in that changeset as a data source to describe such software entities. To investigate this we implement a technique utilizing changeset descriptions and conduct an empirical study to observe this technique’s overall performance. Moreover, we study how the granularity (i.e. file or method level of software entities) and changeset range inclusion (i.e. most recent or all historical changesets) affect such an approach. The results of a preliminary study with Rhino and Mylyn.Tasks systems suggest that the approach could lead to a potentially efficient feature location technique. They also suggest that it is advantageous in terms of the effort to configure the technique at method level granularity and that older changesets from older systems may reduce the effectiveness of the technique.",

            "Abstract": "Modern iterative and incremental software development relies on continuous testing. The knowledge of test-to-code traceability links facilitates test-driven development and improves software evolution. Previous research identified traceability links between test cases and classes under test. Though this information is helpful, a finer granularity technique can provide more useful information beyond the knowledge of the class under test. In this paper, we focus on Java classes that instantiate stateful objects and propose an automated technique for precise detection of the focal methods under test in unit test cases. Focal methods represent the core of a test scenario inside a unit test case. Their main purpose is to affect an object&#039;s state that is then checked by other inspector methods whose purpose is ancillary and needs to be identified as such. Distinguishing focal from other (non-focal) methods is hard to accomplish manually. We propose an approach to detect focal methods under test automatically. An experimental assessment with real-world software shows that our approach identifies focal methods under test in more than 85 of cases, providing a ground for precise automatic recovery of test-to-code traceability links.",

            "Abstract": "The hierarchical method of organizing information has proven beneficial in learning in part because it maps well onto the human brain&#039;s memory. Exploiting this organizational strategy may help engineers cope with large software systems. In fact such an strategy is already present in source code and is manifested in the class hierarchies of objected-oriented programs. However, an engineer faced with fixing a bug or any similar need to locate the implementation of a particular feature in the code is less interested in the syntactic organization of the code and more interested in its conceptual organization. Therefore, a conceptual hierarchy would bring clear benefit. Fortunately, such a view can be extracted automatically the source code. The hierarchy generating tool HierIT performs this task using an information-theoretic approach to identify &quot;content-bearing&quot; words and associate them hierarchically. The resulting hierarchy enables an engineer to better understand the concepts contained in a software system. To study their value, an experiment was conducted to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the value that hierarchies bring. The quantitative evaluation first considers the Expected Mutual Information Measure (EMIM) between the set of topic words and natural language extracted from the source code. It then considers the Best Case Tree Walk (BCTW), which captures how &quot;expensive&quot; it is to find interesting documents. Finally, the hierarchies are considered qualitatively by investigating their perceived usefulness in a case study involving three engineers.",

Existing code comment generation techniques focus on describing the functionality of the source code. However, there are other aspects such as insights about quality or issues of the code, which are overlooked by earlier approaches. In this paper, we describe a mining approach that recommends insightful comments about the quality, deficiencies or scopes for further improvement of the source code. First, we conduct an exploratory study that motivates crowdsourced knowledge from Stack Overflow discussions as a potential resource for source code comment recommendation. Second, based on the findings from the exploratory study, we propose a heuristic-based technique for mining insightful comments from Stack Overflow Q &amp; A site for source code comment recommendation. Experiments with 292 Stack Overflow code segments and 5,039 discussion comments show that our approach has a promising recall of 85.42%. We also conducted a complementary user study which confirms the accuracy and usefulness of the recommended comments.",

            "Abstract": "Operator overloading allows the semantic extension of existing code without the need for sweeping code changes. For example, automatic differentiation tools in C++ commonly use this feature to enhance the code with additional derivative computation. To this end, a floating point data type is changed to a complex user-defined type. While conceptually straightforward, this type change often leads to compilation errors that can be tedious to decipher and resolve. This is due to the fact that the built-in floating point types in C++ are treated differently than user-defined types, and code constructs that are legal for floating point types can be a violation of the C++ standard for complex user-defined types. We identify and classify such problematic code constructs and suggest how the code can be changed to avoid these errors, while still allowing the use of operator overloading. To automatically flag such occurrences, we developed a Clang-based tool for the static analysis of C++ code based on our assessment of constructs problematic in operator overloading for numeric types. It automatically finds instances of problematic code locations and prints Lint-like warning messages. To showcase the relevance of this topic and the usefulness of our tool, we consider the basic routines of the OpenFOAM CFD software package, consisting of 1,476 C++ source and header files, for a total of over 150,000 lines of code. Altogether, we found 74 distinct occurrences of problematic code constructs in 21 files. As some of these files are included in over 400 different locations in the OpenFOAM base, errors in these files create a torrent of error messages that often are difficult to comprehend. In summary, the classification of problematic instances aids developers in writing numerical code that is fit for operator overloading and the tool helps programmers that augment legacy code in spotting problematic code constructs.",

The approach is based on a pushdown flow analysis that besides traditional control and value flow also keeps track of write effects. To increase the precision of our purity analysis, we combine it with an intraprocedural analysis to determine freshness of variables and object references. We formalize the core aspects of our analysis, and discuss our implementation used to analyze several common JavaScript benchmarks. Experiments show that our technique is capable of detecting function purity, even in the presence of higher-order functions, dynamic property expressions, and prototypal inheritance.",

Dynamic data tainting is an analysis technique used to identify dependencies between data in a software. Performing dynamic data tainting on obfuscated software usually yields hard to exploit results, due to over-tainted data. Such results are clearly identifiable as useless: an attacker will immediately discard them and opt for an alternative tool. In this paper, we present a code transformation technique meant to prevent the identification of useless results: a few lines of code are inserted in the obfuscated software, so that the results obtained by the dynamic data tainting approach appear acceptable. These results remain however wrong and lead an attacker to waste enough time and resources trying to analyze incorrect data dependencies, so that he will usually decide to use less automated and advanced analysis techniques, and maybe give up reverse engineering the current binary software. This improves the security of the software against malicious analysis.",

Such cases of undetected cross-distribution bug duplicates can cause developers and users to lose precious time working on a fix that already exists or to work individually instead of collaborating to find a fix faster. We perform a case study on Ubuntu and Debian bug repositories to measure the amount of cross-distribution bug duplicates and estimate the amount of time lost. By adapting an existing within-project duplicate detection approach (achieving a similar recall of 60%), we find 821 cross-duplicates. The early detection of such duplicates could reduce the time lost by users waiting for a fix by a median of 38 days. Furthermore, we estimate that developers from the different distributions lose a median of 47 days in which they could have collaborated together, had they been aware of duplicates. These results show the need to detect and monitor cross-distribution duplicates.",

But can we somehow narrow down where exactly this erosion happens? Is it possible to infer the future erosion based on past code changes? Do modifications performed on frequently changing code have worse effect on software maintainability than those affecting less frequently modified code? In this study we investigated these questions and the results indicate that code churn indeed increases the pace of code erosion. We calculated cumulative code churn values and maintainability changes for every version control commit operation of three open-source and one proprietary software system. With the help of Wilcoxon rank test we compared the cumulative code churn values of the files in commits resulting maintainability increase with those of decreasing the maintainability. In the case of three systems the test showed very strong significance and in one case it resulted in strong significance (p-values 0.00235, 0.00436, 0.00018 and 0.03616). These results support our preliminary assumption that modifying high-churn code is more likely to decrease the overall maintainability of a software system, which can be thought of as the generalization of the already known phenomena that code churn results in higher number of defects.",

            "Abstract": "Overly long methods hamper the maintainability of software—they are hard to understand and to change, but also difficult to test, reuse, and profile. While technically there are many opportunities to refactor long methods, little is known about their origin and their evolution. It is unclear how much effort should be spent to refactor them and when this effort is spent best. To obtain a maintenance strategy, we need a better understanding of how software systems and their methods evolve. This paper presents an empirical case study on method growth in Java with nine open source and one industry system. We show that most methods do not increase their length significantly; in fact, about half of them remain unchanged after the initial commit. Instead, software systems grow by adding new methods rather than by modifying existing methods.",

            "Abstract": "Code clone visualizations (CCVs) are graphical representations of clone detection results provided by various state-of-the-art command line and graphical analysis tools. In order to properly analyze and manipulate code clones within a target system, these visualizations must be easily and efficiently comprehensible. We conducted an eye-tracking study with 20 participants (expert, intermediate, and novice) to assess how well people can comprehend visualizations such as Scatter plots, Treemaps, and Hierarchical Dependency Graphs provided by VisCad, a recent clone visualization tool. The goals of the study were to find out what elements of the visualizations (e.g., colors, shapes, object positions) are most important for comprehension, and to identify common usage patterns for different groups. Our results help us understand how developers with different levels of expertise explore and navigate through the visualizations while performing specific tasks. Distinctive patterns of eye movements for different visualizations were found depending on the expertise of the participants. Color, shape and position information were found to play vital roles in comprehension of CCVs. Our results provide recommendations that can improve the implementation of visualization techniques in VisCad and other clone visualization systems.",

            "Abstract": "Code smells are established, widely used characterizations of shortcomings in the design and implementation of software systems. As such, they have been subject to intensive research regarding their detection and impact on understandability and changeability of source code. However, current methods do not support highly configurable software systems, that is, systems that can be customized to fit a wide range of requirements or platforms. Such systems commonly owe their configurability to conditional compilation based on C preprocessor annotations (a.k.a. #ifdefs). Since annotations directly interact with the host language (e.g., C), they may have adverse effects on understandability and changeability of source code, referred to as variability-aware code smells. In this paper, we propose a metric- based method that integrates source code and C preprocessor annotations to detect such smells. We evaluate our method for one specific smell on five open-source systems of medium size, thus, demonstrating its general applicability. Moreover, we manually reviewed 100 instances of the smell and provide a qualitative analysis of the potential impact of variability-aware code smells as well as common causes for their occurrence.",

            "Abstract": "Unnecessary references in managed languages, such as Java and C#, often cause memory leaks without any immediate symptoms. These leaks become manifest when the program has been running for a long time (usually several hours, days or even weeks). Garbage collectors cannot handle this situation, since it only reclaims objects that have no external references to them. Consequently, when the number of leaked objects becomes large, garbage collection frequency increases and program performance degrades. Ultimately, the program will crash. This paper introduces LeakTracer, a tool that helps diagnose memory leaks in managed languages. The core of LeakTracer is the use of a novel leak predictor, which not only considers object size and staleness as a whole to predict leaked objects, but also carefully adjusts their contributions to the leak possibility of an object, according to the careful observation of activities of common objects during their lifetimes. We have implemented LeakTracer in two parts: (1) an online object events tracker in the Apache Harmony DRL virtual machine, and (2) an offline analyzer embedding our predictor. We have successfully used LeakTracer to find leaks in several real-world programs, and our case studies how that leak predictor can pinpoint leaked objects with high accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Memory leaks are tedious to detect and require significant debugging effort to be reproduced and localized. In particular, many of such bugs escape classical testing processes used in software development. One of the reasons is that unit and integration tests run too short for leaks to manifest via memory bloat or degraded performance. Moreover, many of such defects are environment-sensitive and not triggered by a test suite. Consequently, leaks are frequently discovered in the production scenario, causing elevated costs. In this paper we propose an approach for automated diagnosis of memory leaks during the development phase. Our technique is based on regression testing and exploits existing test suites. The key idea is to compare object (de-)allocation statistics (collected during unit/integration test executions) between a previous and the current software version. By grouping these statistics according to object creation sites we can detect anomalies and pinpoint the potential root causes of memory leaks. Such diagnosis can be completed before a visible memory bloat occurs, and in time proportional to the execution of test suite. We evaluate our approach using real leaks found in 7 Java applications. Results show that our approach has sufficient detection accuracy and is effective in isolating the leaky allocation site: true defect locations rank relatively high in the lists of suspicious code locations if the tests trigger the leak pattern. Our prototypical system imposes an acceptable instrumentation and execution overhead for practical memory leak detection even in large software projects.",

The approach is implemented by a framework that uses dynamic analysis and repository mining techniques to provide an automated way for revealing potential sources of performance degradation of scenarios between releases of a software system. The approach defines four phases: (i) preparation – choosing the scenarios and preparing the target releases; (ii) dynamic analysis – determining the performance of scenarios and methods by calculating their execution time; (iii) degradation analysis – processing and comparing the results of the dynamic analysis for different releases; and (iv) repository mining – identifying development issues and commits associated with performance deviation. The paper also describes an evolutionary study of applying the approach to multiple releases of the Netty, Wicket and Jetty frameworks. The study analyzed seven releases of each system and addressed a total of 57 scenarios. Overall, we have found 14 scenarios with significant performance deviation for Netty, 13 for Wicket, and 9 for Jetty, almost all of which could be attributed to a source code change. We also discuss feedback obtained from eight developers of Netty, Wicket and Jetty as result of a questionnaire.",

            "Abstract": "During its lifetime, a software system is under continuous maintenance to remain useful. Maintenance can be achieved in activities such as adding new features, fixing bugs, improving the system’s structure, or adapting to new APIs. In such cases, developers sometimes perform sequences of code changes in a systematic way. These sequences consist of small code changes (e.g., create a class, then extract a method to this class), which are applied to groups of related code entities (e.g., some of the methods of a class). This paper presents the design and proof-of-concept implementation of a tool called MacroRecorder. This tool records a sequence of code changes, then it allows the developer to generalize this sequence in order to apply it in other code locations. In this paper, we discuss MacroRecorder&#039;s approach that is independent of both development and transformation tools. The evaluation is based on previous work on repetitive code changes related to rearchitecting. MacroRecorder was able to replay 92% of the examples, which consisted in up to seven code entities modified up to 66 times. The generation of a customizable, large-scale transformation operator has the potential to efficiently assist code maintenance.",

            "Abstract": "Developers often release different versions of their applications to support various platform/programming-language application programming interfaces (APIs). To migrate an application written using one API (source) to another API (target), a developer must know how the methods in the source API map to the methods in the target API. Given a typical platform or language exposes a large number of API methods, manually writing API mappings is prohibitively resource-intensive and may be error prone. Recently, researchers proposed to automate the mapping process by mining API mappings from existing code-bases. However, these approaches require as input a manually ported (or at least functionally similar) code across source and target APIs. To address the shortcoming, this paper proposes TMAP: Text Mining based approach to discover likely API mappings using the similarity in the textual description of the source and target API documents. To evaluate our approach, we used TMAP to discover API mappings for 15 classes across: 1) Java and C# API, and 2) Java ME and Android API. We compared the discovered mappings with state-of-the-art source code analysis based approaches: Rosetta and StaMiner. Our results indicate that TMAP on average found relevant mappings for 57% more methods compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, our results also indicate that TMAP on average found exact mappings for 6.5 more methods per class with a maximum of 21 additional exact mappings for a single class as compared to previous approaches.",

Translation validation is a formal verification approach for compilers whereby, each individual translation is followed by a validation phase which verifies that the target code produced correctly implements the source code. In this paper, we present a tool for translation validation of optimizing transformations of programs; the original and the transformed programs are modeled as Finite State Machines with Datapath having Arrays (FSMDAs) and a symbolic value propagation (SVP) based equivalence checking strategy is applied over this model to determine the correctness of the applied transformations. The tool has been demonstrated to handle uniform and non-uniform code motions, including code motions across loops, along with transformations which result in modification of control structures of programs. Moreover, arithmetic transformations such as, associative, commutative, distributive transformations, expression simplification, constant folding, etc., are also supported.",

            "Abstract": "One solution to prevent the quality erosion of a software product is to maintain its quality by continuous refactoring. However, refactoring is not always easy. Developers need to identify the piece of code that should be improved and decide how to rewrite it. Furthermore, refactoring can also be risky; that is, the modified code needs to be re-tested, so developers can see if they broke something. Many IDEs offer a range of refactorings to support so-called automatic refactoring, but tools which are really able to automatically refactor code smells are still under research. In this paper we introduce FaultBuster, a refactoring toolset which is able to support automatic refactoring: identifying the problematic code parts via static code analysis, running automatic algorithms to fix selected code smells, and executing integrated testing tools. In the heart of the toolset lies a refactoring framework to control the analysis and the execution of automatic algorithms. FaultBuster provides IDE plugins to interact with developers via popular IDEs (Eclipse, Netbeans and IntelliJ IDEA). All the tools were developed and tested in a 2-year project with 6 software development companies where thousands of code smells were identified and fixed in 5 systems having altogether over 5 million lines of code.",

            "Abstract": "Testing tools for application security have become an integral part of secure development life-cycles. Despite their ability to spot important software weaknesses, the high number of findings require rigorous prioritization. Most testing tools provide generic ratings to support prioritization. Unfortunately, ratings from established tools lack context information especially with regard to the security requirements of respective components or source code. Thus experts often spend a great deal of time re-assessing the prioritization provided by these tools. This paper introduces our lightweight tool AVUS that adjusts context-free ratings of software weaknesses according to a user-defined security model. We also present a first evaluation applying AVUS to a well-known open source project and the findings of a popular, commercially available application security testing tool.",

However, usually the only programming language available for these drivers is the native assembly-like microcode that, allowing for unstructured programing constructs, exposes to the risk of dangerous control flow paths, like infinite loops or jumps to non-existent locations. In this paper an automatic static analyzer is presented, which reconstruct the control flow graph of an application from the microcode source file and checks for infinite loops and undefined jumps caused by the corresponding jump register not being set for a particular path.",

It uses the game engine of Minecraft for the graphics, and is able to visualize various properties of the code based on structural metrics. In this work, we present our approach to integrate our visualization tool into the Eclipse IDE environment. Previously, only standalone usage was possible, but with this new version the users can invoke the visualization directly from the IDE, and all the analysis is performed in the background. The new version of the tool now includes an Eclipse plug-in and a Minecraft modification in addition to the analysis and visualization modules which have also been extended with some new features. Possible use cases and a detailed scenario are presented.",

            "Abstract": "Software engineers organize source code into a dominant hierarchy of components and modules that may emphasize various characteristics over runtime behavior. In this way, runtime features may involve cross-cutting aspects of code from multiple components, and some of these features may be emergent in nature, rather than designed. Although source-code modularization assists software engineers to organize and find components, identifying such cross-cutting feature sets can be more difficult. This work presents a visualization that includes a static (i.e., compile-time) representation of source code that gives prominence to clusters of cooperating source-code instructions to identify dynamic (i.e., runtime) features and constituent behaviors within executions of the software. In addition, the visualization animates software executions to reveal which feature clusters are executed and in what order. The result has revealed the principal behaviors of software executions, and those behaviors were revealed to be (in some cases) cohesive, modular source-code structures and (in other cases) cross-cutting, emergent behaviors that involve multiple modules. In this paper, we describe our system (Cerebro), envisage the uses to which it can be put, and evaluate its ability to reveal emergent runtime features and internal constituent behaviors of execution. We found that: (1) the visualization revealed emergent and commonly occuring functionalities that cross-cut the structural decomposition of the system; (2) four independent judges generally agreed in their interpretations of the code clusters, especially when informed only by our visualization; and (3) interacting with the external interface of an application while simultaneously observing the internal execution facilitated localization of code that implements the features and functionality evoked externally.",

Using the data gathered in these software engineering tools would be ideal for collecting different kinds of software processes and product metrics as the data is already automatically gathered by the tools. However, the tools present and store the data in various formats. The data collection methods and interfaces also vary between the tools. This closes the software engineering data into silos and makes it hard to build reusable analysis and visualizations for the data. In this position paper we present a unified model for software engineering data and a framework for data collection, conversion and storing that utilizes our model. The aim of the model is to define a common format for software engineering data which is not dependent on specific software engineering tools or the software engineering process and thus can be used as a basis for building reusable visualization and analysis components. To demonstrate that we can build reusable visualization plugins on top of the framework, we created a timeline visualization plugin. The visualization plugin is used to visualize two data sets from industrial software projects that have different contexts and semantics.",

However, there is a lack of adoption of such techniques by the industry. Previous work have analyzed this poor support. Specifically, former approaches lack proper analysis techniques (e.g., detection of architectural inconsistencies), and they do not provide extension and addition of new features. In this paper, we present ORIONPLANNING, a prototype tool to assist refactorings at large scale. The tool provides support for model- based refactoring operations. These operations are performed in an interactive visualization. The contributions of the tool consist in: (i) providing iterative modifications in the architecture, and (ii) providing an environment for architecture inspection and definition of dependency rules. We evaluate ORIONPLANNING against practitioners’ requirements on architecture definition listed in a previous survey. We also evaluate the tool in a concrete example of software remodularization.",

            "Abstract": "In many enterprises the number of deployed applications is constantly increasing. Those applications - often several hundreds - form large software landscapes. The comprehension of such landscapes is frequently impeded due to, for instance, architectural erosion, personnel turnover, or changing requirements. Therefore, an efficient and effective way to comprehend such software landscapes is required. The current state of the art often visualizes software landscapes via flat graph-based representations of nodes, applications, and their communication. In our ExplorViz visualization, we introduce hierarchical abstractions aiming at solving typical system comprehension tasks fast and accurately for large software landscapes. To evaluate our hierarchical approach, we conduct a controlled experiment comparing our hierarchical landscape visualization to a flat, state-of-the-art visualization. In addition, we thoroughly analyze the strategies employed by the participants and provide a package containing all our experimental data to facilitate the verifiability, reproducibility, and further extensibility of our results. We observed a statistically significant increase of 14% in task correctness of the hierarchical visualization group compared to the flat visualization group in our experiment. The time spent on the system comprehension tasks did not show any significant differences. The results backup our claim that our hierarchical concept enhances the current state of the art in landscape visualization.",

            "Abstract": "Analyzing how software engineers use the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is essential to better understanding how engineers carry out their daily tasks. SPOTTER is a code search engine for the Pharo programming language. Since its inception, SPOTTER has been rapidly and broadly adopted within the Pharo community. However, little is known about how practitioners employ SPOTTER to search and navigate within the Pharo code base. This paper evaluates how software engineers use SPOTTER in practice. To achieve this, we remotely gather user actions called events. These events are then visually rendered using an adequate navigation tool chain. Sequences of events are represented using a visual alphabet. We found a number of usage patterns and identified underused SPOTTER features. Such findings are essential for improving SPOTTER.",

            "Abstract": "Today, many of the research innovations in software visualization and comprehension are evaluated on small-scale programs in a way that avoids actual human evaluation, despite the fact that these techniques are designed to help programmers develop and understand large and complex software. The investments required to perform such human studies often outweigh the need to publish. As such, the goal of this work (and toolkit) is to enable the evaluation of software visualizations of real-life software systems by its actual developers, as well as to understand the factors that influence adoption. The approach is to directly assist practicing software developers with visualizations through open and online collaboration tools. The mechanism by which we accomplish this goal is an online service that is linked through the projects&#039; revision-control and build systems. We are calling this system Spider SENSE, and it includes web-based visualizations for software exploration that is supported by tools for mirroring development activities, automatic building and testing, and automatic instrumentation to gather dynamic-analysis data. In the future, we envision the system and toolkit to become a framework on which further visualizations and analyses are developed. Spider SENSE is open-source and publicly available for download and collaborative development.",

In this paper we present Explora, a visualisation tool designed for the simultaneous analysis of multiple metrics of systems in software corpora. Explora incorporates a novel lightweight visualisation technique called PolyGrid that promotes the detection of graphical patterns. We present an example where we analyse the relation of subtype polymorphism with inheritance and invocation in corpora of Smalltalk and Java systems and find that (1) subtype polymorphism is more likely to be found in large hierarchies; (2) as class hierarchies grow horizontally, they also do so vertically; and (3) in polymorphic hierarchies the length of the name of the classes is orthogonal to the cardinality of the call sites.",

In this paper we show how computer games technology can be used to address these problems. We present the PhysVis software exploration system, where software metrics can be variably mapped to parameters of a physical model and displayed via a particle system. Entities can be imbued with attributes such as mass, gravity, and (for relationships) strength or springiness, alongside traditional attributes such as position, colour and size. The resulting visualisation is a dynamic scene; the relative positions of entities are not determined by a fixed layout algorithm, but by intuitive physical notions such as gravity, mass, and drag. The implementation is openly available, and we evaluate it on a selection of visualisation tasks for two openly-available software systems.",

However, they are typically separate tools in practice. In this paper, we present a novel methodology of combining software analysis and software visualization tools via an interactive visual workflow modeling approach. Standard software analysis tools are also limited in that they support only well-known metrics or are too complicated to use for generating custom software metrics. To address these shortcomings, our approach focuses on visual elements, their configurations, and interconnectivity rather than a data ontology and querying language. In order to test and validate our methodology, we developed a prototype tool called VIMETRIK (Visual Specification of Metrics). Our preliminary evaluation study illustrates the intuitiveness and ease-of-use of our approach with regard to understanding software measurement and analysis data.",

Though semantics, notations and reasoning support are well established, maintaining large FMs is still an open problem. As large FMs naturally contain different concerns, some related to domains, others being inherently cross-cutting ones, it is challenging to find a decomposition that will tame this complexity and ease maintenance. This paper presents a visual representation of dependent FMs useful in decomposing a large FM while quantitatively visualizing constraints between and inside them. This Variability Blueprint is intuitive enough to enable the SPL maintainer to confine dependencies between FMs in a small set of identified features inside each decomposed FM. We describe our blueprint and report on its application on two case studies.",

            "Abstract": "Data races in multi-threaded programs are a common source of serious software failures. Their undefined behavior may lead to intermittent failures with unforeseeable, and in embedded systems, even life-threatening consequences. To mitigate these risks, various detection tools have been created to help identify potential data races. However, these tools produce thousands of data race warnings, often in text-based format, which makes the manual assessment process slow and error-prone. Through visualization, we aim to speed up the data race assessment process by reducing the amount of information to be investigated, and to provide a versatile interface that quality assurance engineers can use to investigate data race warnings. The ultimate goal of our integrated software suite, called RaceView, is to improve the usability of the data race information to such an extent that the elimination of data races can be incorporated into the regular software development process.",

            "Abstract": "In a robotics context, visualizing the data scanned by a robot is crucial to understand what the robot&#039;s sensors perceive about its environment. Consequently, robotic visualizations show these values in a 3-D world, such that they can be compared with the real world. However these visualizations do not allow developers to see this data in a manner that allows it to be interpreted for program construction. As a result, these visualizations are in many cases ineffective for programming robot behaviors. To address this issue, we have built several visualizations of robot sensor data for the programming of behaviors, and we report on them here. Our visualizations focus on better revealing the hard data, which allows developers to faster understand it and consequently to faster create and adapt robot behaviors.",

            "Abstract": "Debugging is a tedious and time-consuming task since it is a methodical process of finding causes and reducing the number of defects. During debugging sessions, developers run a software project, traversing method invocations, setting breakpoints, stopping or restarting executions. In these sessions, developers explore some project areas and create knowledge about them. Unfortunately, when these sessions finish, this knowledge is lost, and developers cannot use it in other debugging sessions or sharing it with collaborators. In this paper, we present Swarm Debugging, a new approach for visualizing and sharing information obtained from debugging sessions. Swarm Debugging provides interactive and real-time visualizations, and several searching tools. Our approach was implemented as an Eclipse IDE plugin, using the Java Platform Debugging Architecture (JPDA) and web technologies to collect and visualize data. We present a running prototype and show how our approach offers more useful support for many typical development tasks than a traditional debugger tool. Through usage scenarios, we demonstrate that our approach can aid developers to decrease the required time for deciding where to toggle a breakpoint and locate bug causes.",

            "Abstract": "The present paper introduces the initial implementation of a software exploration tool targeting graphical user interface (GUI) driven applications. GUITracer facilitates the comprehension of GUI-driven applications by starting from their most conspicuous artefact - the user interface itself. The current implementation of the tool can be used with any Java-based target application that employs one of the AWT, Swing or SWT toolkits. The tool transparently instruments the target application and provides real time information about the GUI events fired. For each event, call relations within the application are displayed at method, class or package level, together with detailed coverage information. The tool facilitates feature location, program comprehension as well as GUI test creation by revealing the link between the application&#039;s GUI and its underlying code. As such, GUITracer is intended for software practitioners developing or maintaining GUI-driven applications. We believe our tool to be especially useful for entry-level practitioners as well as students seeking to understand complex GUI-driven software systems. The present paper details the rationale as well as the technical implementation of the tool. As a proof-of-concept implementation, we also discuss further development that can lead to our tool&#039;s integration into a software development workflow.",

Large numbers of cells, complex formulae and missing documentation can impede the understanding of a spreadsheet. Comprehension assesses different levels of a spreadsheet according to a specific maintenance task, ranging from single formulae over sets of cells to complex structural patterns. These levels of abstraction are subsumed under the term cognitive unit.  XVIZIT helps end-users in maintaining and comprehending spreadsheets. It guides them through a spreadsheet model: Roles of cells and sheets, similar patterns and various concepts of modularity can be explored. It uses modularization algorithms to provide conceptional decompositions of a spreadsheet model, such as equivalence classes or data modules. XVIZIT’s slice visualizations ease the evaluation of corrective modifications by showing the dependant cells. Furthermore, XVIZIT provides a number of complexity measures allowing end-users to estimate the effort to comprehend and maintain a spreadsheet.",

The comprehension of software clones is challenged by the sheer volume of data and the complexity of the information content in that data. Visualization, or visual data analysis, takes advantage of human cognitive skills to discover unstructured insights from the visual presentations of complex and voluminous data. In this paper, we survey the existing literature on visualization of software clones. We gather the insights provided, and put that information in context of actual information needs systematically derived from the clone management goals. This framework allows us to better understand the role a visualization may play in achieving a specific user goal, identify potential gaps between existing types of visualization and information needs, and find complementary non-redundant subsets of visualizations for each user goal.",

            "Abstract": "Source code is often reused in software development. Although developers can avoid re-implementing features in existing products, doing so may result in a large number of similar software products. To understand the commonalities and variabilities of similar products, comparing their source code is critical. However, a product may change its own directory structure, even if the products share the same source code with other products. Hence, comparing source code among products in a systematic manner is difficult.  In this paper, we propose a technique to extract and visualize a unified directory tree to compare the source code of similar products. This tree includes all directories of given products and merges corresponding directories into a single node. Since a node in a tree corresponds to multiple directories in products, developers can easily compare the contents of products. In our study, we implemented the visualization as a GUI tool. In addition, we conducted a case study using four Android products to demonstrate the tool&#039;s ability to assist developers in accessing the source code of multiple products.",

The optimal visualization of this structure depends on the task at hand. In general, the software structure is mapped to a graph and graph drawing algorithms are used for displaying the structure. The task of drawing these graphs becomes more involved if not only one type of relations, e.g., call graphs, but many relation types should be analyzed at the same time. We propose a small-multiples node-link visualization, where each small visualization shows the graph related to one edge type. The visualizations are synchronized using selection and coordinated views. Using a separate view for each of the relations provides additional analysis capabilities. The main advantage of this approach is, that optimized drawing algorithms can be used for each type of relationship while being able to display multiple relationships at the same time.",

            "Abstract": "Existing high-level, source-to-source compilers can accept input programs in a high-level language (e.g., C) and perform complex automatic parallelization and other mappings using various optimizations. These optimizations often require trade-offs and can benefit from the user’s involvement in the process. However, because of the inherent complexity, the barrier to entry for new users of these high-level optimizing compilers can often be high. We propose visualization as an effective gateway for non-expert users to gain insight into the effects of parameter choices and so aid them in the selection of levels best suited to their specific optimization goals. A popular optimization paradigm is polyhedral mapping which achieves optimization by loop transformations. We have augmented a commercial polyhedral-model source-to-source compiler (R-Stream) with an interactive visual tool we call the Polyhedral User Mapping and Assistant Visualizer (PUMA-V). PUMA-V is tightly integrated with the R-Stream source-to-source compiler and allows users to explore the effects of difficult mappings and express their goals to optimize trade-offs. It implements advanced multivariate visualization paradigms such as parallel coordinates and correlation graphs and applies them in the novel setting of compiler optimizations. We believe that our tool allows programmers to better understand complex program transformations and deviations of mapping properties on well understood programs. This in turn will achieve experience and performance portability across programs architectures as well as expose new communities in the computational sciences to the rich features of auto-parallelizing high-level source-to-source compilers.",

Most of existing work provided different techniques to mine API usage patterns from client programs, in order to help developers to understand and use existing libraries. However, considering only client programs to identify API usage patterns, is a strong constraint as collecting several similar client programs for an API is not a trivial task. And even if these clients are available, all the usage scenarios of the API of interest may not be covered by those clients. In this paper, we propose a visualization based approach for the refinement of Client-based Usage Patterns. We first visualize the patterns structure. Then we enrich the patterns with API methods that are semantically related to them, and thus may contribute together to the implementation of a particular functionality for potential client programs.",

            "Abstract": "Large codebases — in the order of millions of lines of code (MLOC) — are incredibly complex. Whether fixing a fault, or implementing a new feature, changes to such systems often have unanticipated effects, as it is impossible for a developer to maintain a complete understanding of the code in their head. This paper presents CodeSurveyor, a spatial visualization technique that aims to support code comprehension in large codebases by allowing developers to view large-scale software at all levels of abstraction. It uses a cartographic metaphor to produce an interactive map of a codebase where users can zoom from a view of a system’s high-level architectural components, represented as continents, down to the individual source files and the entities they define, shown as countries and states, respectively. The layout of the produced code map incorporates system dependency data and sizes regions according to a user-configurable metric (line count by default), to create distinctive shapes and positions that serve as strong visual landmarks and keep users oriented. We detail the CodeSurveyor algorithm, show it generates code maps of the Linux kernel (1.4 MLOC) in 1.5 minutes, and evaluate the intuitiveness of the metaphor to software developers and its utility in navigation tasks.

            "Abstract": "While constructing and evolving software systems, developers generate directly and indirectly a large amount of data of diverse nature, such as source code changes, bug tracking information, IDE interactions, stack traces, etc. Often these diverse data sources are processed and visualized in isolation, leading to a partial view of systems. We present a blended approach to visualize several data “ingredients” at once, to give as complete an answer as possible to the question “What happened to the system in the last few days?”. The goal is to enable a quick and comprehensive assessment of what happened to a software system in any given time frame.",

            "Abstract": "Building architects, but also civil or mechanical engineers often build from their designs physical 3D models for a better presentation, comprehension, and communication among stakeholders. Software engineers usually create visualizations of their software designs as digital objects to be presented on a screen only. 3D software visualization metaphors, such as the software city metaphor, provide a basis for exporting those on-screen software visualizations into physical models. This can be achieved by 3D-printers to transfer the advantages of real, physical, tangible architecture models from traditional engineering disciplines to software engineering. We present a new research perspective of using physical models to support software engineering. Furthermore, we describe four envisioned usage scenarios for physical models which provide a plethora of new research topics. To examine the benefits of our concept, we investigate the first usage scenario by evaluating the impact of using physical models on program comprehension in teams through a first controlled experiment. Since the usage of physical models had a diverging influence for our chosen task set, we report on the qualitative results in this paper. We observed that the physical models improved the team-based program comprehension process for specific tasks by initiating gesture-based interaction.",

            "Abstract": "Software visualizations, such as the software city metaphor, are usually displayed on 2D screens and controlled by means of a mouse and thus often do not take advantage of more natural interaction techniques. Virtual reality (VR) approaches aim to improve the user experience. Emerging new technologies, like the Oculus Rift, dramatically enhance the VR experience at an affordable price. Therefore, new technologies have the potential to provide even higher immersion - and thus benefits - than previous VR approaches. We present a VR approach to explore software visualizations following the software city metaphor by using a head-mounted display and gesture-based interaction. Furthermore, we detail our gesture design and how we implemented this approach into our web-based ExplorViz tool. As first evaluation, we conducted structured interviews where participants had to solve three program comprehension tasks and rate the usability of the used gestures and general VR experience for program comprehension. The participants of our interviews rated the developed gestures for translation, rotation, and selection as highly usable. However, our zooming gesture was less favored. In general, the subjects see potential for virtual reality in program comprehension.",

Problems within the process may have severe organizational and financial consequences. Visualization helps monitor and analyze those processes. In this paper, we study the development of large software systems as an example of a complex work process. We introduce Developer Rivers, a timeline-based visualization technique that shows how developers work on software modules. The flow of developers&#039; activity is visualized by a river metaphor: activities are transferred between modules represented as rivers. Interactively switching between hierarchically organized modules and workload metrics allows for exploring multiple facets of the work process. We study typical development patterns by applying our visualization to Python and the Linux kernel.",

However, this information is not directly accessible in the version control archives and must be extracted and visualized. This paper describes ConceptCloud, a flexible, interactive browser for SVN and Git repositories. The main novelty of our approach is the combination of an intuitive tag cloud visualization with an underlying concept lattice that provides a formal structure for navigation. ConceptCloud supports concurrent navigation in multiple linked but individually customizable tag clouds, which allows for multi-faceted repository browsing and for the construction of unique visualizations. We describe the mathematical foundations and implementation of our approach, and use ConceptCloud to quickly gain insight into the team structure and development process of two projects.",

            "Abstract": "Voronoi treemaps can be used to effectively visualize software quality attributes of a given software system. To easily keep track of how the values of such attributes change over time as the software evolves from one version to the next, it is essential that the produced visualizations are stable in the sense that small changes to the values of the attributes lead to small changes in the visualization. Due to the non-deterministic nature of the standard algorithm for computing Voronoi treemaps, stability is not guaranteed. In this paper we introduce stable Voronoi treemaps for additively weighted power Voronoi diagrams. We employ scaled Hilbert curves to place Voronoi sites in the plane, thereby achieving a predictable first good approximation of the final location of the sites, and then retain the order in which sites are placed along that curve for easy comparison with revisions of the same software system.We show that our algorithm not only provides more stability, but also that because of better placement it needs fewer iterations to compute its result.",

A specific focus of my research is on methods for visualizing and comparing large and time-varying graphs and hierarchies, often in the context of software. Recent projects also explore applications of word-sized graphics (sparklines) within IDEs and other interactive systems. I graduated in Computer Science (Diplom-Informatiker) at the University of Trier, Germany in 2009. As a research assistant and PhD student, I worked in the Software Engineering Group of Stephan Diehl at the University of Trier (2009-2013). My dissertation, which I defended in June 2013, is titled &quot;Understanding Multi-Dimensional Code Couplings&quot;. Since April 2013, I am employed as a postdoctoral researcher at VISUS, University of Stuttgart, Germany in the group of Daniel Weiskopf. I am member of ACM, IEEE CS, and GI.",

            "Bio": "Birgit Vogel-Heuser conducts research on the development and system evolution of distributed intelligent embedded systems in mechatronic products and production systems, with the aim of improving product quality, the efficiency and consistency of engineering activities and operational availability. She develops methods, descriptive aids and tools for integrating the various perspectives of mechatronic systems (mechanical, electrical/electronic and software) and phases in the life cycle and their interactions. Key non-functional requirements are real-time behavior, modularity, availability and usability. Her research projects range from fundamental research in automation technology to the derivation of requirements from industrial applications and the development of prototype tools.  After graduating in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Aachen (RWTH), Prof. Vogel-Heuser earned her doctorate degree there (1991) in the area of robot programming in mechanical engineering. She acquired industrial experience over a ten year period, including a position as Engineering Director for the Siempelkamp Group (systems engineering).
